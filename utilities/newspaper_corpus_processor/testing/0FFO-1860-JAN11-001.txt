hands of a member of the Victoria Brigade, it was found that the

Master and Wardens, together with their Proof-master, having in¬
spected the fragments of the burst riffe, find such representation to
be correct, and that the rife in question has been manufactured and
sold without the barrel having been submitted to the test requisite to
guarantce its safety, and contrary to the provisions of the Gun-barrel
Act, 1855, which enacts that no barrel shall be ued in the making of
any small arm, nor shall a small arm be sold or kept for sale unless the
barrel or barrels thereof have been duly proved at the Proof-house of
the Gummakers Company, the Birmingham proot-house, or some
other public proof house, established by law, and duly marked as
proved and inasmuch as the master and wardens have reason to
believe that many riftes are now in the possesion of members of the
different brigades the barrels of which have not been duly proved,
whereby the safety of the public as well as of individuals is manifestly
endangered; all Commanding Offices of Riffe Brigades throughout Eng¬
land, as also the respective members thereof, and the public generally,

against the purchase or use of rified and other arms without being

marked as proved according to the said act of Parlament.

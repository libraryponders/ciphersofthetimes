SERTED in he West London Observer of the 17th day of Decem¬
ber 1852, à LETTER, reflecting on Mr. Weaver, of Walham green, on
account of a statement made by him at a Meeting of the Fulham
Board of Worke, on the lith ult., relative to an alleged nuisance ema¬
nating from the Chapel in Waterloo street, and whereas, upon inquiry,
we consider that we were not warranted in the expressions therein

Mr. Wester for the expressions made use of, and of which he has
cplained to us, as we feel assured that Mr. Weaver acted only in the
discharge of his duty in his communication to the Board of Works, and
that an escape of gas from the meter in the chapel, and at the gate
—
unaware, warranted the statements made by Mr. Weaver, and we do
hereby retract the statements and observations made by us refecting
on Mr. Weavers character and integrity.

			THE BnRADON COZLIRRY EYPLOSION.
			NTEWCASTLEBON TYN,E An= 4.
			The adiourned inquest on the bodies of the 76 pitmen ancl pt Isds kiDed in Burradon Pst on the 2d of March by an explosion of gas was resumed this morning at Burradon, ample time having been given bv a lengtheneed adjournment for a careful and scientifio examination of the rmine. The chapel where the inqnest was held v;as crowded, anui the proceedings were of an exceedingly exciting an&amp; singular character. Mr. Serjeant BalantinTe shoulaI
			have been down to examine the wlt-nesses on behalf of the relatives o� the deceased persons, but he was umable to be present, belng detained in town. Mr. E3llott, an eminent viewver belonging to the county of DBr. ham, who had exumined the pit, and who was to have beer a witness,had asLo been caled away, having had to proceed to Parls to consalt with the French Government upon some matter of business; and Mr. Phillipson, who had hereto; fore conducted the inquiry cn behalf of tho owner of the pit, refused to call any more vitnesses that day. The re. sponsibUity of producing evidence -was thus thrown upon Mr. Blackwell, barrister, who appearod for the rela- tives of the decesmed in the absence of Mr. Serisenf Ballantine, ancd as he was not ready with his witnesses tha Ooroner threatned to commence to charge the jury, wheoe. upon Mr. Blackiwell said that he wonld go into the enemie% camp, and examine Mr. Thomas B. Foster, the welliDoTi
			north country coal viewer, a gentleman of great experienc, in the coal trade. Exception was tken to the remark made by Mr. Blackwell, and a scene followed. Mr. Foster sfl that he belonged to no party, and that ho was oly. anxiols to elicit the trath, so as to prevent accidents in future. Mr. Foster was then examined at length by Mr. Blackwell; but when Mr. Harle, who repro. sented the Government Inspector, who was present, got up to put some questions, Mr. P1hillipson demurred to Mr. IIarel appearing ; the Coroner Also objected, on the groaun that the Government Inspector should examinethe witnesses himself. Mr. Harle then said that he would ask for an ad. ionrament until he had consulted wlth the Home Secretay as to the course of proceedings.
			Mr. Ilarle was at last allowed to go on, but had not pro. ceeded far before Mr. Pilllpsen interfered, when an extra. ordinary scene arose. M r. Pale ordered Mr. PhiMipson to sit down, and caUed upon the coroner to put him out. The Coroner, however, turned his wrath upon Mr. J.B. langley, a gentleman who has talken an active part dring the in- quiry, and whom he espied whispering to Mr. Hasrle, whom he threatened to put out. The pitmen in the body of the chapel had by this time become very excited and comr
			menced to hlss with great vehemence. The Coroner threatened them with expulsion, and there was every pros. poect of a riot if he carried hls threat lnto execution; but ha fortunately did not attempt to do eo, and Mr. Hrle pro. ceeding with the examination nninterrapted.
			Mr. Thomas Emsnerson Foster, viewer, said that ho hai been down the pit several times since tho explosion. The first time he was down was on the 9th of March, but the pit was not then in a proper state to make an examimtlon. The stoppings and other things were so deranged that a proper examination could not be made. The next tlme h. was downnwas on the .1th of March. The pit as not then in a proper stte. The ventilation was not at al reatoreda The next day he was down was on the 21st of March. The pit was then in a much better state, but stil the airwaya an3d atopping wrer not properly restored. Tho Ist timebe we down was last niTght. On the 21st of March he came to a conclusion, according t his view, as to the occasion of the accident. HiS view was that the first explosion os- curred in Maddox's Board. That exploslon was not a very serious one. It was occasioned by the gas accumulating bae tween the east middle rolleyway and MaddoxBoard to [the north. The cause of the acoumulation was a fali of
			stone immediately behind Maddox Board in the single part of the north return. The gus came from the solid ooal. BbS view was this, that up to a certan time before the exploslon there was a sufficient ventilation from the middle eas robeyway to Mddom Board, to keep tha workings at those twopointsclearfromgns Atthe timoewhentherowVIsaaIlght explosion on Williams's candle the fall had partdilly takenplace. Between that time, and shortly beforeltho explosion occurred, the fall of stones had so increased that it had almost if not entirely stopped the airway in the re- turn. Hence the dirtexploseia of gar betweon the ast rolley- way and Maddox Board. The reason forhis coming to ncon. elusion that the first explosion had not been a serious ono was this, that he found tbattherowere 24people kiled atthe top of the inclined bank undcr a faD of coal; and he was clearly of opinion that they had arrived at that point befor3 tho second explosion took place. He found William Urwin at that point, and he, when he was at work. wrought at the fourth board fromthe middleeest, towards hfaddox?sBoard&amp; Thomas Beadlen wrought in the third board from the middle east towards Maddox's, and his body was found among the 24 lying under the fall There were several more from the same district, and also Irom the middle broken. Ho ecme to the conclusion that the first explosion ws not a severe one from the men having got to that point- and so far from -where the first explosion oceerred.
			tHe t gt the men had arrived at that point whenAlder. eon, the hack overman, came up the inclined plauc. After hearing the explosion, his opinion was that he induced the men to remainthereunutil he went to seewhat really was the matter. The consequence was that Alderson haa not got 100 yards south from the top of the inclinedc plane before tho second exploslon took place. Those 24 people that he had already al}uded to were killed by the second explosion dr-wing the tim- ber, and the roof came down upon them. That was the conclusion that he had como to with regard to the first explosion. With regard to the second explosion, he was of opinion that tho' first exolosion took a south. westerly course from Maddox's Board, blowing out stoppings on both sides of the straight up east rolleyway, and which
			separa-ea. toe wnoie cOam anc the bro6 en; that the first ea- olosion disturbed some gas in the middle broken, which had been driven on to the middle east roUeywav, whee, meeting some meen from the south making their wr;ay ont, the gas fired at their candles. HE was of opinion that the men in the tar south-east quarter
			h e ome oat after the second explosion, and had got within a fewr yards of the air-crossing between the top of s-he first incline and the midlde east rolleywsy, when all of them had been klled by' the after damp. If theyhadgo nine yards fmther they would have been sate. He thouwh that he was corroborated as to the first explosion not havi been a serious one by the fact that a number of tho m
			in the middle broken oontinued at their work and were lost, whereas those who left the middle broken after the frt explosion were saved.
			Mr. Foster was cross-examined at considerable length by r. BoackweJl upon his evidence in chief. p e gave varl
			reasons for coming to the conclusion that the firt explosion. hatd been occasioned by a fell of stosne in the return, which, derangin the vent-ilation in thst part of the pit., had
			daced the socond and destructive exploelon of gasa He said that us soon as the fatl of stone was removed Maddox' Board bheame clear and the gas all passed away. x b
			By r. Harle.-Has beena viewer 37 years. Had ex-
			time the property of theMecosnrs. arrc examined thpioai
			at tha,t time for a professitonal objeoct, on a financial ques. ti.on. From that time untll 1 is recent visit on the 9th ed
			in hat clliry ho woul�d dhave conducteod the venwtilationn the same way as it existed on the 2d of March, the day of the explosion. If to-day they could. p lace the pit; at Burradon in the posltion In which It was on ,the 2dl of March at S o'ldock, when Kerkley left , ho should hoj quite satisfied. If the pit wvas in as good a datat
			as on the 2d of March, ho could not suggest, nor was there any necessity for, anz iMuirovement. Na human power COUlIE' have prevented the all o stone. Such accidents happeno3 without nLny notice. lHe thought Kerkley acted pruidently In setting on the " putters" with lamps, because they lad to go the whole workings and the pWr workings, and they. might have gone into the pillar worldnga with the nak-ed light. If sx men complained of the ventilalion in January or February of the present year he could give no reason for he compant. Witness went down the pit on the 4'th of March as a eighbour. Hlis services had been volunteered; He had not been asked by the under viewer or the men to go down. Kerkley did not give him his theory as to the fall in the north return whon he went over the plaeo on the 4th of March. He had notformed en opinion on the 4th of March as to the fail, not having seen it. Eis opinion was that the exilosien did not occur from the gas at the north goaf. IE it had occurred there, thefe would have been one great ex- plosion, and n.ohttwto. HeI coOnrsidlrered thOe pit perfeclysfl;ar
			reth o ai passed along the face of the workings and clown.
			te north return behind Maddox's Board This being the case be should have trusted entirely to the air auc wrougt with candlese. He should not have calculated
			upon Lae conzmgency or a tau ot stone In the single return course. Had no suggestion to offer as to a fall In a retur
			course. If there had baen two retarm instoad of one, if one bad fallen the other might have been ke?t open. Unfortu- tanately there was only one return. 1hey were not in a position for two. If he saw gas upon the candle so that the use of it had become dangerous he wonld have diacontinned it, and would have used the lamp. If there were 5 OO) or 6 000 feet of atmospheno air pasidng into iiddoxes Board it would be safo. If theairws flying three feet per second the placewould be perfectlysafe. If tho air was clack in Maddoxs Board the pas might rome from the goaf to where the men were working. if thea

If you go on until there nro elghtoortlons of air to one of gas that wrould be the most explosive nlxtume. Then if yen gO on ntifl there are 14 volumes of air and one of gas, then the gas will not explode.
			Mr. yoster having been examined 'at great length by 1Er lIarle the Court adjourned at 4 o'clock sintil Thursday.

			TmUmsm&amp;Y EVZnMO.
			Although the closing prices from Paris yesterday Thowed a further improvement, the English funds open(ed t-tus morning at a reaction of an eighth. The mnarket, however, oon assumed a firm appearance. Conaols for money were first quoted 94i to i, and they clozed at 944 to J for money, and 944 to 2 for tIhe May account. There were rew speculative transactions, and the general business was unimport- ant. The Rupee Stocks show an advance of a quarter per cent., the final prices being respectively :u8 to J and 103, to 1044. India Stock left off at 218 to 220; India Five per Cents., 1044 to 105; Tndia Bonds, 4s. discount to par; and Exchequer- *bills lOa. to 13s. premium.
			The Stock-Exchange will be open on Saturday, although the attendance is likely to be small.
			The demand for discount to-day has been rather less heavy, and at the Bank the applications, although numerous, were not so large as during the last few days.
			There was a better Inquiry for foreign stocks in the :morning, and in some cases an advance took place, but the market showed less strength at the close. Vew Turkish Six per Cents., after touching 624, left off 614 to 62, or the same as yesterday, while the old stock was firm at 79 to. IMexican receded to 22 to J. Brazilian Scrlp marked par, and closed
			dis to par. Brazilian Five per Cents. were nego- tiated at 98, ex div.; Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 1852, 90i; ditto, 1858, 91; Equador INTew Con- aolidated, 12; Land Warrants, 3 ; Grenada Active, 15; Deferred, 41; Mexican, for the ac- count, 22k, 4, i, and 22; Portuguese, 424; for the account, 4241 and 42; Russian Four-and-a- flalf per Cents., 97; Spanish, for the account, 464 and s; Deferred, for the account, 341; Turkish Six ier tFents., 79,; for the account, 79, and 80; Sew Loan, for the account, 62, i, and 61:; Vene- zuela Three per Cents., for the account, 264 * and iDutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 100, ox div.
			The closing quotation from Paris this evening wasz 69f. 90c., showing a further rise of an eighth.
			In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates wvere generally a shade higher than last post.
			*There were no gold operations at the Bank to- dlay.
			Tho accounts from India to-day show that the R2upee Stocks had experienced a decline of about 1 per cent., from which there was subsequently a recovery. lnthe Calcutta rate of exchange there had been an advance of id., making lt 1 psr cent. dess favourable for this country.
			. The private advices from Mexico confirm the statement that Captain Aidham, of Her Majesty's Rup Valorous, had obtained an interview with I permon during his advance upon Vera Cruex and hd induced him to enter into negotiations with the hadrex Government under a fdag of truce. It appears that instrictions were sent from Lord John Russell both to Captain A ldham at Vera Cruz and the
			nglish Minister at 3Iexico, but that the despateh to ahe latter could not be forwarded, communication be- tween Vera Crux and the capital being entirely sas- pended. Captain AIdham, therefore, obtained permis- sionl from the Juarez Government to visit the head- quarters of MIirasnon, who had already pushed his advanced guard within sight of the town, and who was himseh f atMedehu, abo ut 15 miles distant. here h first interview was with General RobIes, who was bor some time in the United States and speaks Eng- lsh well, and who now seemed to see the danger of weeping an army accustomed to the comparatively cold climate of Mexico in the hot plains round .Yera Cruz, and also the results to be exrected
			from the indirect aid to be given to Juarez by the --Americans. A n inter-view then followed with
			ilrmamon, who is said to have been very courteous, and who, after being made acquainted with Lord wohn Russellts despatch, agreed to write a fetter to Juarezi This document anrived at 7/era Craz on the following day under s flag of truce, and was said to be exceed- ingly lengthy, but its contents had not yet ftanspired. It was thought, howvever, not to be uamoovourable to the prospect of some arrangement being arrived at. According to report, Lord John JhRssell's despatch points out to both parties the outrages they are inficting upon their common conltry, and also the offeaces against foreign
			presidens, for which they must be held responsible; and concludes by advising an armistice for six ueontha or a year- and the summoning of a General Assembly.
			in theacolonial produce-markets duringothe week no importmat change has occurred, and the transac- tions generaly have been moderato. The limited quantity of plantation Ceylon coffee submitted re- aiizedthe full valuations, but several parcels now landing will shortly afford a better supply. Floating cargoes of foreign fuly support the late advance.
			the sugar-market continues without animation, bat 'within the past two days there has been rather more inquiry from consluners, especialy for good descrip- tlons. The operations in rice have again been con-
			lderable, at last week's quotations, and, the delive- ies being still remarkably large, the stock has lately rundergone a serious diminution. Spices have occa- Edonaly sold at a further reduction. and stocks con-
			tinue heavy. WVhite pepper is fuilly id. per pound cheaper. The tea-market remains very dull, and the business has been exceedingly small. Green teas, from the recent arrivals, have been parted with at easier rates, and congous are offered at the decline established last week, but there seems less disposi- tion to press sales of the finer grades. An inquiry exists for Bengal saltpetre afloat, which has realized 4As. to 44s. (;d. per cwt., while parcels here are taken slowly at last Friday's rates. The small stocks in America are still a subject of observation.
			The dates from South Auatralia by the present mail are to Adelaide, February 18. Business con- tinued dull. The revenue of the colony for the year ending December 31, 1859, amounted to 605,8701., showing a net increase upon the year of '54,0391. The pastoral districts had suffered severely through the dry season, and the mortality among the cattle had been considerable. Respecting the progress of mining, the Soth Austrelian Adrer- wiser of February 18 remarks :-" The mineral wealth of the colony continues to afford proofs of Its extreme riceness." Burra Burra shares have advanced to 1581. Copper remained firm and in de- rnand, at 1001. per ton. Drafts on London at (30 days' sight at 1 per cent. premium.
			The following describes anew method adopted by the Greek firms in the Danubian grain trade to throw risk upon English consignees :_
			LiAverpool, April 4.
			"Sir,-We are to-dayadvisedbyour MarkVlano correspon. dents as follows:-' Pleaso take note that al seUlers (of 1icatinR cargoes of wheat, Incdan corn, &amp;o.) insist upon the following clause in contracts :-Tho cargo is to be taken as it tnds; should any sea accident affecting the quantilty on board the vessel tako place, invoico quantity to be finL'
			" To Illustrate this, a biUl of lading is signed at Sulina tor 1,200 kIlogrammes, cargo is sold per quarter of 4SOlb., and paid for upon a provisonal invoice, reckoning loO hilogrammes eqnal to 232 quarters ; In short, 2,784 quarters are paid for. Upon discharge in England, it proves by Customs' measure 2,5914 imperial quarters, and weighs 2,455 (4SOlb.), or short by measure 1924 quarters, and by weight 329 16-4S0lb. This is no imaginary case. Names ef ship and seUers2 who are respectable Greek mer- chant,, will be given, if required, and contract ls dated London, January 2, 1860. Contract provided for correction of invoice on discharge, and seUers repaid npwards of 4001, overpaid provisionally. But it is now proposed that in a similar case, where 200 to 300 quar. ters more than is actuaUy shipped is inserted in bill of lading, a not unusual case, and sea accident affects quantity either by increase or diminution, buyer must pay the conse- emences of shanmeful neglect or shameless fraud. Do not London factors see that by such a clause a premium is held out for the preparation of fraudulent documents? Will not Irish buyers see that in buying under such a clause it is mere hap-hazard, and much nearer a gambling adventure than ab business operahion ?

They further intend to continue the sinking of the engine shaft at the same time to 40 fathoms, and then extend levels north and south 30 fatlhoms on the course of NichoU's lode, as they consider 10 fathoms bet vaen levels wiU be found sufficient.

			"The directors have received a communication dated the 14th of February, from Mr. Morehead, the superintendent at Sydney. The advices from the Good Eope Mine reach only to.the 20th of January last (or 12 days later) in conse- quence of heavy feoods having rendered the roads impassable and interrupted postal communications. MIr. Morehead states-' The north shaft had progressed with varying pro- spects as respects the lode, but no decisive change of a favourable or unfavourable charcter had taken place. Morehead's Shaft.-The lode, where It had been driven upon north cud south, had fallen off in its yield of ore. MI'Calum's Shaft.-In sink-ing here the lode has suddenly improved considerably, becoming full of stains of blue car- bonate, and thick-ly studded with spots of red oxide.'
			"BDuN MousmTis-.
			o" The directors have advices from Nelson, New Zealand, of the 30th of January, stuting-
			" '1. We have cut the chrome lode in the deep level, which thus proves the ore in depth, and is of the highest importance. This level Is 28 fathoms below the large de- posit of chrome already known, and 25 fathoms below the upper level, which is also in chrome, and, from these facts, there can ho no doubt now of the practicalUy inexhaustible quantity of chrome ore on the property. 2. At the North Copper Mine the lode has at length been cut on the level which was driven 11 fathoms; this when first cut was dis- ordered, but on driving north, towards the shaft, has be- come regular and Is 1A to 2 feet wide, of solid mundlc, with traces of copper ore. 'his level wiM be continued 10 fathoms to the shaft, at 4. per fathom, iin which direction lb wil
			probably improve. 3. Contractors are bringing down chrome ore on bulleoks until you authorlze the construction of the railway, and the ore is of excellent quality. I beg to say that chrom does noteit at the Crolxelles, notwithstanding the assertion to the contrary by the Chamber of Commerce, as Dr. Iochstetter, who said as much as he could In favour of the mineral wealth of the province, did noe allude to chrome ore at the Croixelles, and I also could not find any there. 4. A new lode of splendid specular iron ore coated with oxide of coppor has been discovered upon your pro- party. In Europe this would be very valuable, but at pre- sent it is useless to us; however, as it may lead to some- thing, it shall be explored.'
			" Bor AccosD.
			"The directors have received a communlcation from the committee of management at Adelaide, dated 17th of February, advising the renewal of actual mnining operations. The enggine was started on the 23d nlt., andalthough it did net at first workc so smoothly as; was expected, It very soon got the water in fork, and is now gqing steadily, keeping the workings clear at two strokes a minute, with a con- sumption of about two tons of wood feel in the 24 hours, showing a great saving as compared with the former engine. Tho main efforts are now directed to sinking the engine- shaft, and driving from it at the 30 fathom level ; the only other work is tho new shaft to the east. The lode in the Burra, called ' Tinlines,' is expected to run through our property, near about where we are sinking."

			Sir,-I by no mean desire to lead a host of complainers against a Government institution, but your able and useful treatises on this sabject deserve, and will be strengthened by, the corroboration of private individuals. I hope my case is singular ; I fear not; at any rate, It is true. Within the last two months I sent by post two pairs of gloves- though only to travel four uiiles they never arrived. A friend, only three miles off, sent me by post 11. 13s. 6d. in coin. Tho coin never arrived, and only a fortnight since another friend sent me by post a banker's draught and a post order, worth abont 301. The letter never arrivedc* and yet, in varions ways, I cannot contribute less than 2001. per asmum to tho Post-office revenue, Were the Post-office authorities liable as are our public carriers, for what they receive in trust or due delivery, these things would soon cease.

			NEW AIODE OF PrOPuisIox.-The Greenock A drer- User descrlbes a new mode of propulsion which has been appiUed to a steam yacht on the Clyde. The screw, which is three-bladed, Is fitted at the bow, and the vessel fs dragged forward instead of being propeled from abaft, as in the or- dinary mode. On Saturday the yacht went ona trial trip, with a pressure of 151b. of steam; she proceeded smoothly up the river, and after laying to for a short time, the pressuro was increased to 301b., wben she steamed back at the rate of from eight to nine knots an hour. The engine worked vcry sweetly. Some slght alteration YiU be made on the Iscrew, wvhich i.a expected to iocrease tho rate of speed. This novelty in marine engineering is the invention oE Mr. Balcer.street, end w,e understand that the vessel belongs to lfr. Tennent, jun., of Wellp.,rk, 3nd other Gl:;sgow gen- tlemen.

			Mr. Reed, tho secretary, read the advertisement conven- ing the meeting.
			It was explained, in reference to the first BiU that the Severn VaUey Company were to grant to the Oxord Com- p any a lease of their undertaking for 999 years. The Oxford Compan were to work the Severn lne, and to pay to the Severn Valley Company 55 per cent, of the gross receipts, and also 5 per cont. of the grosa earnings from the Severn VaUey tramic upon the present or future Oxford eystem. The Oxford Company were to issue the debentnres of the Severn VaUey company, and to charge only the average rate of interest paid on the debentutes issued by the Oxford, Worcester, atnd Wolverhampton Company. Tho lessees were also to keep the Severn Valey Conpany's registers of transfers and debentures, and to Pay all dividends to the Severn Valley proprietors without charge.

			_ LONDQO1DERRY AND ENNSEILLEY.
			4mju -JLneo. meesig OX alia COMPany was held yeSter-
			day at the office Coleman-street-balldings, Mr. J. Clay,
			I The CHAntAN stated that the meeting had been ai-
			'outned to consider a BiDl for authoriLing the construction of a raUway to Letterk-enLy. bht, as ib was not sufficiently advauced to submit it for their app)roval, the meetinwould be further adjourned to the 8th of May.
			This having been agreed to, the meotlng specilly con- vened to consider the proprlety of leasing the Londonderry and EnniskIlien Railway and workcs to the Dundalk and Ennisillen RaUway Company was then held.
			Mr. LavxLs read the notice convening the meeting.
			The CAmRuNe sead they had all read the circular, con- taining an outline of the agreements which the directors had prepared for them.
			The Solicitor then read the heads of the agreement, dated the 17th of March, 1S60, for leasing the Londonderry and Enniskilen Railway to the Dundalk and Ennisldlien Ilail- way Company for 35 years, renewable every 35 years, at 26,0001. per annum for the first three years, the rent to Increase gradually out of surplus receipts above 95,0001. a- year until it reached 33,0001. a-year.
			.JTThb CHA-Tpisen, in submitting a resolution approving the aoreement, said the directors did not even pretend that they Ead made a good bargain, bnt the great advantage of it wras that, although they would not get more than thley were entitled to, they would change an uncertainty for a certainty ; anl they would thus he remunerated for the
			theha expended. The great bulk- of the share- were Englishmen, who were not acquainted with the very fierce local competition that was going on between two or three large towns in the distriet, and which would affect the trafflo o;n the line to some extent, if k-opt in its [present state as an independent line. It was the circum-
			staneo of that local struggle which had determined the directors to entertain the agreement ho had to submit for their approvaL Their line united with the Duendalk and Enniskillen Railway, WOu13 decide the question as to the struggle, and give them an undoubted security for their rent. Ire concluded by moving a formal resolution ap- proving the lease being granted and authorizing the
			diectors to carry out the same, and to affi-x the seal of the company to the agreement.
			Mr. =lGEB seconded the motion, and said that int stead of the two lines being branches, as heretofore where theywere united under one management, they vwoud form atruanir line, andl be worked cheaper than at present. Heo believed thait both undertaldiogs would he of mere value the day after the aranwgement was concluded than ever they [were before.
			Mr. FUILLER movedl an amendment to the effect that the agreement snade by the directors he not adopted, and that an offer he had been authorized to make from M1r. Gordon,
			r Co roa thegart of the Duwivmane and UliturRaiL
			Vwy Companles, be accepted. Tho offer was to tho efferI
			that the line should be leased for 999 yoae-to Mr. Gordo= for two years from the 1st of Janury last at 26,000L. peH anDnum, 2S,OOO for the third year, 29,0D00. for the fourth year, and so on until the rent amounted to 33,000f, in the seventh year. He also offered to purchase the plant; for 25,000!, wvhich wva to be paid immediately if the termL were accepted, and the rent would be paid we-akly.
			Along 'cussoi enmea, in tho course of which it wa5 contended that the Dnmdalk Company were authorized by fParliament to leae the lineanand would pay them 4,000!, for their stores, bult that M-r. Gordon and the other parties mentioned were not authorized by Parliament to lease tho line, and therefore the offer was no offer at aJl, because they had ao power to accept it even if tho security vem better than that of the Duendai Company.
			Mr. J. TYnRREL seconded the amendment.
			On a show of hands there appeared 10 for the smend- ment and S8 againsb it; the amncndment kwas cGnsequently lost, and the original motion was carriedi by 88 against S.
			Mr. Fa?tM. demanded a nDll, but, as it appeared the

			Tas BAD WoKSs OF HE m oroLrrAN BoARD.- The Metropolitan Board of Works has not at any time sinco its first establishment been In very good odour. The stench of the Thames duing the last few seasons and tho failure to queU it did not improve its reputation; and the efforts now being made to provlde a deodorizer for the approach. ing summer are likely to leave # it ?a worse coMe tean ever before, The Beard ave committed many great blanders; they are abouat to extingluish these by one whiech shal be im- measurably greater. They are advertislng for thounds of gaUonsof percilorado of iron,bywhibhthoymeansomething elso. Warnedbythe unutterable stenchof tbhThames during the past seasons, and seeking means more efficaclous than thosa hitherto employed, which converted the water into a pecullarlynnlnvitiggvaietyof sanitaryllme-soup, the Beard had called into council two eminent chymlsts, Dr. Hofmann and Dr.Frankland, whom theyinvited to seloct, from a ahoal of schemes submittedto theBoard,adeodorizingp.-ocess, com- bining both efficiency and economy. Of those proposed the name was legion. After rejecting the proposition of Mr.
			ogttule for dosing the river with salt, end with others for galvanlzingthoastenisbed waters, and treating them to elec- tricoshocks3,these gentlemen reported that only cenefnid pos- sessed " that combination of qualities which could warrant them inzecommending it to theietrop olitanBoard of Works forthedeodorizatln of theBondon sew;age." The agent was that described as "Dale's murlate of iron," which "far sur- passes any other in its immediate acton and permanent effects." Its saperiorlty in immediate actonarlses from ths small quantity which Is needed of the fluid, for five drops effectnaDydeodorlze agallon of fe'idsewawge; or half-a-gaUon. suffices for 7,500 gallons of sewage, as Drs. Hofreran and' Franklandreport. Next, in the facilty and rapidity of its aplicatlon, and in the agreeablypellud condition In which the deodorized water Is subsequently left. Finally, whereas sewage deodorized with lime or chloride of lime (the next best agents) becomes offenslve and putrld four days after treatment, that treated with Dale's fluid remains perma- nently deodorized. Probably it may also be said that It Ls disinfected, for the Iron salts appear not only to deodo- rize, but to precipltate the organio matter, which is likely to act as a ferment. Hence the com- pleteness and permanence of the deodorizatlon. The reporters confirm aU that has been alleged in these re- spects concerning Dale'sfluid; but finding it to contain an excess of perchloride of iron, they fel into the grave chymical error of spealdng of it through the latter part of their report as perohloride of iron. This Is an error which two chymists of high abOity should have avoided It has led to serious mistakes, and promise3 to produce a glgantic blender. Misled by that loose and incorrect description, the Board of Health at Croydon had already, In December last, set to work to manufacture the percbloride. and em- ployed it In the public deoderizatlon of sewage. The result, w3 are informed, was a dead failure, and they were com- rXed to desist, and employ the fluid upon which alone Drs. ]ofmann and Frsnlland reported. This fluid is dis- tlugnlshed from simple porerhoride of Iron by es- sential characters. Thus, it preelultates prasdan blue from the solution both of the ferrld and ferro-cyanide of potassium; whereas perchloride of iron gives no such reaction with tho ferrid-cyanide. Again, alkalies precipitate from It an oxide which is found to bo magnetic when drlod. It Is a filuld of very Interesting chycalc alpropertles, containing what chymlsts have hitherto held tobeamechanical mixture of protochloride and per- chloride of iron, but which, from the study of its effects1 may rather prove to be a chlorlde corresponding in con- dition with what would bo a magnetic chloride of Iron. The chymical blender of the reporters has been magnified by the Board into a sanitary blunder of the greatest magni- tude. The fact is, that the perchlorlde of iron did not come under the notice of the reporters at all; they reported throughout on Dale's fld. The perchlomide of Iron has comparatively feeble powers of deodorizatlon. The bard are advertising forthousands f gellons of a fiuld of the properties of which thoy know offcily nothing; they are asking, in fact, for what they do not mean, and wil get what they do not want. The result wil be, that thousads of pounds wll be wasted, and the Thames will stink worse tasn emer.-Tnc,4

			LONDON, FRIDAY, APRIL 6, 0.
			The Emperor of tha FRExCn finds it necessary to reassure the fluttered spirits of Germany, and, if the remedy were only adequate to the disease, we may readily admit that it never was more called for. At first sight it might appear that Germany had the utmost cause for alarm. If twelve millions of Italians, menaced on the North-weat by Austria and her formidable Quadrilateral, with the sea-coast open to the superior navy of France, and a Govern- ment not yet consolidated by time, can inspire such terror into the breast of the conqueror of Magenta and Solferino that he cannot believe himself safe unless he seize Savoy and lNice in order to shelter himself behind them, what amount of territory will be required in order to secure France against the evil designs of forty millions of Germans united for centuries in a federal league, and disposing of military and material forces far more formidable than any that are wielded by these terrible Italians? The ENSEOR massures the Germans that by the ces-
			sion of Savoy and Nice all his apprehensions are terminated. The separation of Belgium from Holland, and its formation into a neutral kingdom, have put an end to all those apprehensions which France might otherwise have entertained of an invasion of the Dutch. To he sure, there is some- thing wanting to the eomplete protection of France on the North which sBh has just obtained in the South. The neutralized districts of Savoy-neu- tralized, we apprehend, if the truth must be spoken, not for the purpose of defending France from the invasion of Switzerland, but rather of shielding Switzerland from a new French pro- tectorate-have now falen into the hands of France herself, while Belgium, which was doubtless intended to do the same good office between France and Holland, is still an independent though neutral sovereignty. The Emperor N.Aor,xoz has the mag- nanimity not to complain of this. Perhaps he thinks the time not yet come for annexing Belgium, as he has annexed Savoy. Perhaps he thinks that Bel- gium on his northern frontier is a very efficient protection, and secures his left flank in case of an advance on the Rhine. Be this as it may, the Emperor of tne FRxscH is pleased to profess himself satisfied, and Germany may, if it will, accept his moderation and spare him Belgium as a set-off to the highly aggressive instinct which has been evinced in the matter of Savoy. For ourselves, the only fault which we have to find -with these demonstrations is that we have a difficulty in believing what the French Emrznon assumes as self-evident-that fear was really the motive which prompted the seizure of Savoy. Fear or necessity, which comes practically pretty much to the same thing, has always been supposed to be the defence which suggests itself most readily to the minds of absolute Princes. But if Germany should happen to be of opinion that it was not fear of Italy and Switzerland, but rather the determination to be still more formidable to them, which led to the occupation of Savoy and Nice, all the eloquence of M. ThouvziE will do little to reassure her.
			Founding ourselves on this supposition, we would earnestly entreat Germany, comprising under that name both Princes and people, carefully to ponder on the present position of affairs. Why is it, let them ask themselves, that France has ever been to them so formidable aud encroaching a neigh- bour? Why is it that the great Teutonic race, from whose hardy ancestors it is the pride of Frenchmen themselves to be descended, is kept in perpetual alarm for its liberties and its very existence by a nation not more numerous nor more highly civilized than itself? The answer is sufficiently obvious. The French are a nation,-the Germans are only an aggregate of confederated States. This was not always so, but France has always pre- ceded Germany in its advances towards unity, and has always encountered her at a corresponding advantage. In the days of Louis XIV. the kingdom of France consisted of a number of feudal States, differing in laws, in customs, and in manners, of each of which the King of FxRAiCE was the head; while Germany, with her innumerable Princes, was weakly organized, and paid but a doubtful and occasional obedi- ence to her EursRon. The loss to Germany of AIsace, Franche Comte, and Lorraine is the per- manent record of the power of unity as opposed to complexity and multifariousnems. Since then Germany has made but slow and faltering steps towards unity, wbile France, at the very com- mencement of her great Revolution, obliterated every vestige of diversity, and organized the whole country under a system of absolutism, the, most central, the most pervading, and the most complete that the world has ever seen. This is the durable and memorable fruit of the great French Revolution. Democracy has passed over the land, and annihi- lated not only the distinction between order and order, but between province and province. The French Government dlsposes absolutely of all the resources of the State, and puts in motion the same potent machinery on the shores of the Chan- nel, the Atlantic, and the Mlediterranean. If France move at all, she moves altogether. The sam e will disposes with equal facility of the resources of Brittany and Provence, of Picardy and Guienne. There is but one exchequer, one army, one navy, one law, one Sovereign for this vast aggregation of human power, valour, industry, and talent; there- fore France cannot move witlhout electrifying Europe, and can and does do and say things which it is permitted to no other Power in Europe to do and say.
			Let Germany well consider these things, and then turn her glance inward upon herself. We, as a Power wedded to peace and the arts of peace, have every reason to wish that Germany, whose Princes since the time of FnnxsDEcn the GREAT have ceased to be aggressive, should be able to maintain herself free, inviolate, and independent against the two mighty empires which bound her on the East and on the West. Every symptom of her strength we hail with pleasure, every proof of her weakness we accept reluctantly, and against our wilL Unfortunately, during the whole of the present century we have had much more frequently to deplore the weakness than to exult in the strength of Germany. By the First N.AroLoEo1 she was repeatedly overrun and almost entirely conquered, and during eight years of enforced submission she endured enough, one would
			have thought, to make her omit no precaution against incurring such a fate a second time. The hour of deliverance came; the exhaustion of the youth of France in endless wars, the destruc- tion of half-a-million of men in the Russian cam- paign, at least an equal loss in the protracted war in the P'eninsula, the maritime superiority of England, and the fatal pertinacity of NAroLEoN, restored Germany once more to herself. How has she employed this second restoration ? Has she taken nrecautions effectually to prevent another catastrophe like that which almost blotted her out from the list of nations, and left her, like Greece after the time of P.HirP, nothing of a national existence but a national literature; or is she not even now just as much exposed as ever to a catastrophe like that which overtook her in the first years of the present century P The causes are the same, and we know no reason why we should expect the effects to be different. Then, as now, Germany was divided into a number of smal
			States; then, as now, Austria and Prussia were acting on a fatal dualism, and suffered Germany to perish in their hands while disputing which of the two should take the lead in her Councils; then, as now, Germany had a central autho- rity which nohody respected and nobody obeyed, of whose endless deliberations man- kind were weary, and of whose futile resolutions no one was aftraid. Should the same crisis return, it will be encountered by preciscly the same means which failed so signally in arresting it when it came before. Now or never is the time for Germany to combine, to forget the animosities which so many centuries have failed to heal, and to present to Europe the spectacle of a nation deter- mined to hold its rights on the only tenure by which they can permanently be maintained. We should have thought that Princes and people had learnt by this time how impossible it is to maintain their independence vith an organization which invites the violence that it has no means to repel; but, as far as we can see, our warnings and remonstrances are in vain. Not only are the Ger- man Powers discordant among themselves, and each given up to its petty end, but they seem determined finally to alienate from themselves the support of a gentle and docile, but brave and patriotic, people.
			While they present a divided front to their great antagonist, they are basily undermiinig the supports of their own internal power. They have lost the confidence of each other, with- out obtaining the confidence of other people. The old feeling of loyalty is disappearing, and, were it not for a national sentiment which seems ineradicable in the German breast, her people would have little cause to dread a change of rulers, and might well accept such a result w"ithout eeek- ing to avert it by the calamities of war. It may not yet be too late. Timely concessions may bring back the good will of the people. The necessary changes in tho constitution of the Bund may render the whole force of the nation available in case of need; but the emergency presses, and the nation is called upon to make its choice between the institutions that so often have ruined it and the unity and efficiency by which alone it can be saved.

			There is a well-known JorE M:Tim which occa- sionaly finds a resemblance in serious action. A traveler at a crossroad was relieved to see a member of the Society of Friends approaching. !'This is the way to York, isn't it?" he asked. To which the other replied, " Friend, first thou " tellest a lie, and then thou askest a question." This has been the course of proceeding adopted on the so-called Commercial Treaty. The Treaty was concluded on January the 23d, in a most despotic manner, nobody even knowing anything about it, except the high contracting parties; and on March the 24th-two months after-the Board of Trade is sending letters to the various Chambers of Commerce throughout the kingdom, not only asking questions, but even suggesting that the several Chambers shall send delegates to Paris to negotiate the very clauses of the Treaty which were supposed to have been negotiated two months ago. For our own part, we must con- fess ourselves utterly mystified. As we were never in the secret of the Treaty, so -we are not aware, even to this day, how the matter stands, and whether there be any Treaty at all, except that England has surrendered all she had to give. Our sensations are those of a garrison which has been informed that a capitulation has been con- cluded on most advantageous and honourable terms, but sses itself let out by detachments and com- mitted to bondage. We want to know when the other side of the Treaty is to appear, and what it is. NVe are all now such out-and-out Freetraders that we should have been quite ready to give up every duty we have taken ofif in pure generosity, without stipulating for a return. That would at least have been a grand idea, and we might have shamed the French, if shame has not departed from them, into something like reciprocity. But we were not permitted to be generous. There must be a con- sideration. We must be barterers and hucksters, and, for certain State reasons, we must appear what NXroLEoN caled us,-a nation of shop- keepers. That indeed was a libel, and if ever on the face of the earth there was a people that did everything across a counter, and brought everytbing, human and divine, to the measure of a franc, it is our specious neigh- bour and ally. But we were to belie our real character and to put on a disguise, for the pur- pose of bringing ourselves down to the level of French institutions and the French charac- ter. Well, we did. We put on blouses and beards, we cropped our hair close, and we looked as like Frenchmen as we could. For form's sake, and to gratify the EMPERoR and his Court, we pretended to sell what we were giving. What we gave has now pretty well passed out of our hands. As far as it is concerned, we are in the case of the countryman who has sold his horse, and lost sight both of it and the purchaser for an hour, still expecting the latter to return and pay. When are we to have that handful of country notes, however dirty and greasy ? The only inti- mation as yet of the purely nominal price, which was all that we expected from France, is a set of questions circulated by our Board of Trade, inti- mating that if people expect to get any con- cessions from France, in return for an almost abso- lute surrender of all our equivalents, they had better go to Paris and try to get them for them- selves.
			The Treaty being thus more than two months old, and matters being ripe for preliminary in- quiry, the Board of Trade wants to know what aro the articles upon which a reduction of duty below a maximumn of 30 per cent. would be especially acceptable, and whether our manufacturers would prefer the duties to be ad valorem, or the ad valorenz rate to be assumed as the basis of specific duties, and what have been the average prices of articles for the last six years. The answers returned by the Birmingham Chamber, which we published yesterday, do not speak favourably for the feel- ings of that town on the subject. For half- manufactured articles, such as metal sheeting and tubing, they recommend duties to be charged by weight. Mlanufactured articles, commonly included under the title of " hardware," are so various, they say, that no average value can be given, and a scale of specific duties is therefore impossible. A duty of 30 per cent., or specific duties at this rate, they consider fatal to all hopes of trade with France, and they appeal to the state of our trade with Belgium, which at a much lower tariff takes very little of our hardware. As for the proposal of deputies, they are of opinion that, as the branches of trade are infinite, and nothing will be done with France in any of them under the Treaty, such a mission would be nugatory. The people of Birmingham, therefore, it is evident, expect to get nothing under the Treaty, but cheap wine, brandy, and silks, for themselves and their wives, if their trade with other countries will enable them to purchase such luxuries. The Treaty they consider to be more finally and irrevocably concluded than its authors and framers supposed, and think that the new swarm of small negotiators invited to assist at the " details" would find the crumbs left for them very few, small, and dry. Indeed, we don't see what other conclusion is possible. We have done a good thing in lowering our own duties if it turns out that we can do without them; but, as for any return of this civility from France, that is a delusion, and the sooner our manufacturers open their eyes to the fact the better for their own comfort at least.
			It is vain to ask whether this is the sort of Treaty that Mr. COBDEN thought he was making, because the Treaty is not yet made, in the opinion of Government; and oar manufacturers find them- selves asked to make it for themselves. The wonder increases why the Treaty, yet to be made, and done only in the general, was not made at once and outright, by regular diplomatists, of whom England possesses and maintains a legion. What and where are all these men, that we should have had recourse to others utterly unversed in the ways of diplomacy, and evidently not able to distinguish between the beginning, the middle, and the end of a Treaty, and who do not even know a Treaty when they see it ? MIr. COBDEN supposed himself making a Treaty when he was surrendering all that should have formed our slde of the bargain; and, now that the fact is too plain, British manufacturers are requested to go to Paris and mend matters if they can. So far the profes- sional diplomatists have a triumph, for Liord COwrzv probably considered himself superseded by the arrival of an Ambassador Extraordinary
			in the great apostle of Free Trade. The officials are not the only people who exhaust their art in knowing how 2wt to do a thing ; for, if the object was to give a fresh opening to British manufactures by the increase of a direct trade with France, that has not been done. When Parliament reassembles it would be desirable that we should hear, on authority, what is the state of this " Treaty," and how far France is bound, forzthe French wil cer- tainly not give us one per cent' or one sau more than they are obliged by the letter of their bond, and it is a new principle that our manufacturers are to address themselves for relief, not to their own, but to a foreign Government.

			The world goes on getting better in many things, but it is much to be doubted whether it increases in charity. In little things and in great things people are stil as prone to attribute evil motives to each other as they ever -were. When MIr. BRYAN KiNo invents a neow style of ecclesiastical miTlinery and upholstery, certain parishioners attribute to him the motive of notoriety-hunting, and others believe him to be an ill-disguised Jesuit. The rev. gentleman himself, not to be behindhand with his critics, publishes a large pamphlet to testify against them as guilty of sacrilege. So when the Emperor of the FrnENca undertakes to assure the King of the BmoaLNs that he has no designs upon his territory, all Europe persists in believing that the mere fact of the Enranon having cast his eyes that way is sufficient notification that the first foot of pathway towards the distant end is already laid. The most prudent, and simple- minded, and candid, and consistent men are never safe from misconception in this world. We are constantly being called upon to help some homme incomnpris who is buffetting with a popular delusion; and we ourselves are continuaUy compelled to lament our own want of power to place the motives and conduct of individuals exactly in the point of view in wlhich they them- selves would wish to bave them appear. Sometimes it is a plaintiff or a defendant in a court of law, sometimes it is a Greek merchant, sometimes it is a Black Doctor, but to-day it is no less a per- son than a public man of a certain degree of renown, who has recently been rather persistent in claiming for himself a position in the public eye. It is no less a person than Mr. HossANa, the member for Stroud and late Secretary for IreLand, who asks for space in our columns to disabuse his constituents and the public generally of some mis- conceptions which have gone abroad as to the ten- dency and objects of his public conduct.
			Mlr. HoRsmAw is very welcome to the publicity he asks at our hands. We sympathize vith him, for he is a victim to a prejudice which, we fear, is but too common, and in his case the preju- dice has been carried rather further than the highly artificial courtesies of the present age allow. Mr. HosssrAN7 has been a public man for a great many years, and he has sat in the House of Commons for we wvll not say how many Parlia- ments. He has been a Lord of the Treasury, and since then Secretary for Ireland under a Whig Administration, wherein he had an opportunity of showing how useful he could be in office, and how indispensable to a Government formed from his political friends. His industry and usefulness in that posifion dwell In the memory of his colleagues, who are unhappily bound to secrecy, so it is not in our power to dilate upon the proofs he gave of them. But the Government of which he formed part went out; other Governments iu motley succession took their place; and now auother Whig Government is in office, and Mr. Honsn.Arz bas not been asked to resume his ancient position. This fact is in itself a fact against the Government. It manifests such a want of dis- crimination, and such an absence of jadgment, that, upon the highest and noblest of public grounds, it renders it impossible for iMfr. HonmiaN to place any confidence in Mtinisters so devoid of the first requisites in dealing with a great people. This was the public position o; Mir. HORSMAN at the commencement of the present session. WlThat followed was perfectly natural. Im- mediately after the session hal opened MIr. HORS- stAs found that this purblind Government had made a commercial treaty with France, and he in a straightforward manner denounced them for havmig taken such an exceptional and objection- able course as to proceed by treaty in commercial matters. Then he discovered that the Govern- ment were going to put the country in a state of defence, and he interposed to prevent any pre- cipitancy and to insist upon a deliberate and careful investigation. A few days subsequently he returned to the charge, denouncing the double policy of a treaty of peace and a rivalry of armaments, and he stood up boldly in opposition to the Government talkin to itself those times and seasons for the discussion of these questions which had been set apart for the disposal of window-cleaning Bills and other important alterations in the law of which private members had taken charge. Gathering strength as he proceeded, Mlr. Honsua," col- lected his objections to the treaty that formed the corner-stone of the policy of the Govern- ment in an amendment, which was not, indeed,
			successful, but which he enforced in a very eloquent speech. Although the Tory party made a point of supporting him, Mlr. HomzuAR could not succeed in persuading any of the Liberal party to vote with him, so he was left in rather a forlorn minority. Tho next possibility of attack was upon the subject of Savoy, wheu some alarming speeches were made by k[r. FITz- aERpALD, Mlr. WnTriDs, and others, which rather annoyed the general public, by inducing a fear that |we were about to be committed to a war witb France upon a totally inadequate occasion. Mr. HFORSMAN again took the side of Toryism and chivalry, and, denouncing " a policy of timidity "and vacillation," showed how honestly and con- sistently he carried out his convictions that this unappreciating Ministry could do nothing that could ever redound to the honour of the country-not even get into a war with France. From this time forward Mr. HOEs- az has been perseveringly upon his legs. No member of the House of Commons has been more instant in season and out of season in dolivering bitter speeches against the occupants of the Treasury benches. If you walked into the House of Commons, there was Mr. HonsvAx; if you took up a newspaper, there was Mr. HoaSmAxN; and he always appeared with a spoke in his hand, which he was trying to thrust into the wheel of this unappreciating Government.
			It is this high course of public usefulness which has been so entirely risinterpreted by the electors of the borough of Stroud. They have held public meetings, and have passed something like a vote of repudiation of their representative. The electors of Stroud seem to have the charity which hopeth all things, but not the charity which be- lieveth all things. They seem to have been impressed with the hope that their repudia- tion of Mir. Honsmxw might induce him to retire, but they were hardly fled with the bellef that his course had been the natural course of a member for a Liberal constituency. YLr. Honsaxi-
			has now shown them how wrong they were in both respects. In his letter, and especially in his postscript, he has demonstrated to his foolish con- stituents that in criticizing him they have be- trayed their country. The electors of Stroud did not know It, and probably Lord JoN RussEu may not even yet be convinced of it, but to
			the eye of the profound political philosopher Mr. HoRsmAN- and Lord JoHN Russmx are one. Mr. Honsytr%i one night, when he was prodding and lungeing at the Mlinisterial ranks, stirred up Lord Joux Russmr.a who, after he had delivered him- self of the particular groan which the particular assault suggested, remembered that he had some warning words to say to the Emperor of the
			.&amp;}ioS. Then it was that Lord Josa- said those few memorable sentences which vwould have pro- duced a sensation In Europe if the electors of Stroud had not repudiated Mr. HoRosMAt. But those Stroud electors have, in their precipitancy and in their presumption, given away the whole game to " the dexterous enemy of their country." We must beg they will not ask us how it is they have done this-we state. it upon Air. Hons- srs's authority-but it seems somehow wrapped up in the assumption that if you doubt the con- sistency of MIr. HonsHrAN you destroy the official authority of Lard lJoHa Russzai. For ourselves, we doubt neither. Tho principle of all modern political controversy is, to attribute to every public man the most obvios maotives in conversation, but to credit him with high angelic attributes whenever we speak or write of him in public.

			The close of last week brought us to qusrter- day-a fact which it may seem somewhat unne cessary to record. We have a motive, however, for doing so. On that day there was due to Go- veriment from certain taxpayers of the kingdom the sum of 300,0001., orthereabouts, and the same amount will be levied in each of the three suc- ceeding quarters of the year. Altogether, some- thing like 1,300,000Z. will thus find its way into the Exchequer as a contribution to the revenue, and, as the amount is considerable and the principle of the tax quite unique, we ask for the attention of the public while we examine its bearings. This seems the very time for reductions and readjust- ments. Silk Duties, 'Wine Duties, Customs' Duties of all kinds have been doomed to extinction, and we shall be much surprised if we cannot make out a case against the impost of which we are spealding -the Daty on Fire Insurance.
			Thousands of our readers will have found in their letter-boxes during the last few days a certain obliging reminder from their Insurance-offices, and which adopts this method of intimating that, unless a specified sum be paid within 15 days, the guaran- tee desirable against fire will cease and determine. The offices, however, are wise in their generation. They are at the pains of analyzing their demands, and of discriminating in the very terms of their notice between their own dues and the exactions of Government. Tho premium, or payment required for the purpDse of insurance, is so much,-the Government duty on the transaction is so much more. The first point, therefore, for consideration is the proportion between these two constituent parts of the smm-the next Is the general charac- ter of the tax itself.
			On the former of these heads, the case presents, as few will deny, a very startling aspect. The Government duty exactly trebles, in ordinary in- stances, the original demand. The premium com- monly required by Insurance-offices is is. 6d. per cent. That is the consideration for which they will guarantee an insurer against loss by fire. Supposing that no particular or unusual risk attendu the transaction, the offices will insure any property to the extent of 1001. in value for the payment of eighteenpence per annum. On the back of this, however, comes the Government tax, and that tax is three shillings per annum, so that the whole amount claimed by the Insurance-office becomes 4s. Gd. Compare this with other taxes, and the impost wil be found almost prohi- bitory. Even brandy was never made three times as dear as it need be. We have been taking, too, a mere unit of measurement-the single 100l.; but multiply it, and see how the figures run up. It is no great thing to insure for 2,0001. W'hat with stock in the case of a tradesman, and ordinary property in the case of independent householders, nothing is easier than to find this amount of obligation incurred. Be it remembered that the reckoning must include every article in the house from top to bottom-not only the furniture, the plate, and the wine, but the wearing apparel of every member of the family, and all, in short, which a fire would consumne. Now, as far as the necessary charge goes, an Insurance-office would take the whole risk for ll. 10s. per annum, whereas the duty levied by Government actually swells the demand to 41. 10s. The insurer is thus taxed 31. upon 30s.-a proportion perfectly enormous.
			Let us now consider the character of the tax itself. Of course, in some sense it is a direct tax, and also in some sense a tax upon property, but we venture to say that never yet was a property- tax so levied. Mr. Basiar proposed the other day to place a tax upon property. His scheme did not find much favour with the public, but its principles were at least more reasonable than those of the Insurance Duty. Ioc would have taxed all property alike, without allowing imprudence to bring a right of exemption; but he would not have treated a tradesman's stock as property, or levied his tax upon goods obtained merely for the purposes of sale. In the Insurance Duty. no cognizance whatever is taken of property until its owner wishes to secure it against the risk of fire. A man with 5,0001.-worth of plate or
			turmiture m his house is not called upon for a penny, provided he choose to remain uninsured; whereas his neighbour, with a stock in trade worth 5001., must pay 15s. yearly to Government, be- sides 7s. 6d. to the Insurance-office, if he wishes to be guaranteed against ruinous loss. The tax, therefore, is levied, not upon property, but upon the act of securing it. If a man chooses to run the risk of being beggared, Government will encourage him in his recklessness by exempting him from a tax; if he is too cautious to incur this peril, he must pay for his vwisdom. it is in vain to argue that the duty does not really operate in this manner, and that the amonnt is too small to deter anybody from insuring his goods. The duty turns a payment of 11. into 31., and it would be preposterous to Suppose that tho latter obligation would be accepted as freely as the former. If a reduction of 2001. per cent. upon the cost of a thing will not bring it into more com- mon use, what becomes of all the speculations on which M1r. Gr.DsroNu founds his Budget? What is the good of cheap silk or cheap claret unless cheapness meaus increased custom in the article ? If there is truth, as assuredly there is, in the rela- tions traced between price and consumption, it follows necessarily and directly that the heavy duty upon Insurance discourages the practice of insuring, and that a premium is thus placed by legi3la- tive enactment upon culpable inaprudence.
			We perfectly remember a little blue-book, issued some three or four years ago, in which the operation of the Insurance Duty was described in terms of un- bounded admiration. The reporter on the subject declared his opinion that the tax, for a tax, was in- credibly well conceived, and that, by some strange peculiarity of incidence, it suited all parties and injured none. To these doctrines we shall offer only a single answer. If the Insurance Daty Is so mys- teriously beneficisl, what has induced farmers to deprive themselves of the advantage ? The insurance of farming stock is exempt from duty, and farming stock is insured, accordingly, to the value of nearly O,000,OOOL. Are we really to anderstand that agriculturists enjoy no privilege in
			this respect ? Or may we not rather assume that, as farming stock is liable to combustion and ought to be protected by insurance, the Legislature designed to encourage prudence by removing a tax which stood in its way? We think t,here can be little doubt on this heads and we think also that what is good for farmers is good for the rest of the community. The obligation of providing against a ruinous contingency is as bind- Ing upon one man as another; but, vithout draw- Ing any comparison between the claims of classes, -we are quite content that the Insurance Duty nkould be judged by its own demerits. It cannot be defended as a property-tax, for it is not a tax to which property, as sueb, is liable. It cannot be defended from its incidence on the rich, for it is the miiddle class -which most feels it. The owner of fifty houses can be his own insurer, and can cover his risk by his annual savings of premium and duty together. Neither Is the tax insignificant in its amount, for its produce is nearly equivalent to that of the old Window Duty, and it is levied from fewer person1s besides. Of its effect in discouraging prudence we have said enough already, and, if the result of the whole survey does not suffice to condemn this tax, there can be very few taxes too bad for defence.

			LATEST INTELLGENCE.
			|TEE PAPAL EXCOMLUNICATION.
			The following text of the Excommunication has been received at Mr. Reuter's office:-
			Apostolic letter of our most holy master Plus IX., Fope by the grace of God, by which the punishment of major excommunication is inflicted on the invaders and usurpers of some of our pon- tifical provinces.
			"I PUS P P. IX.
			"To the eternal memory of this matter.
			"As the Catholic Chur,ob founded and established by the Lord Christ for the everlasting alvatidai of mankind, has acquired the form of a perfect soclety, [by its divine character, it ought, therefore, in the ful- filment of its sacred ministry, to possess that free- dom by which It may not be subject to any clvil Power; and, furthermore, in order to obtain that, the Church required those guarantees which were In accordance with the conditions and necessity of the time. It was, therefore, in accordancae with divine Providence that after the fall of the Roman empire, and its consecutive division into several kingdoms, the Romish Pope, whom Christ has established as the chief and the centre of his whole Church, obtained temporal power. Therefore, it has been ordered by God in the wisest manner that, as such a great number and variety of princes exist, the Holy Pope should enjoy that poli- tical liberty which is so much wanted, in order to exercise his spiritual power, authority, andjuris- diction in the whole world without any impedi- ments. And, therefore, it was necessary that the Catholic world should not have any reason to sup- pose that the Romish Pope is subject to any in- fluence of temporal Powers, or biassed in the exer- cise of the religious powers which the Holy See has to fulfil over the greater part of the Christians. It is easily understood that the dominion of our Roman Church, although having the appearance of something temporal, nevertheless is really of a spiritual character by the holy destination which it enjoys, and by the close ties by which it is connected with all Christian affairs. But this does not prevent that all those things which conduce to the secular welfare of the peoples may be obtained by the Church, as the history of the temporal reign of the Roman Pope during so many centuries shows most clearly. The general good and welfare of the peoples being increased by the temporal power which we are alluding to, it is not astonish- ing that the enemies of this Church endeavoured to weaken and to embarrass it by many intrigues and all kinds of attempts.
			" In these impious attempts they were van- quished sooner or later by God, who always defends the Church. The whole world knows already how during these sad times the adversaries of the Catholic and Apostolic See have made themselves detestable by their attempts, which were charac- terized by their lying hypocrisy in trying to deprive the Holy See of its secular power They could not obtain their end by an open attack and by force of arms, but only by false and pernicious principles, by cunning dissimulation in their conduct, and by maliciously provoking popular risings. They did not blush to counsel the peoples to sedition a,gainst their princes, which is clearly and distinctly con- demned by the Apostle when he says, ' Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God the powers which are are ordained of God. lVhoso- ever, therefore, resisteth the power resistoth the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive
			uu ineluseives camnation."- Tlhese wicked innova- tors, in attacking the temporal power of the Church and its temporal dominion, and in despising its venerable authority, go so far in their impudence as to feign esteem for the Church and obedience to her comimands. And it is the most to be deplored that some of those on whom, as sons of the Catholic Church, the duty was imposed to protect that Church and to maintain its power, have sullied them- selves by their wicked acts. In these mischievous and perverse intrigues, which we deplore, the Sar- dinian Government has the principal part, as it is generally known how much in that kingdom the Churchl has suffered injuries and restrictions, which -we have already vehemently lamented in our Con- sistorial Allocution of the 22d of January, 1855. The Sardinian Government has until now despised our just reclamations, and has even dared to inflict on our(Church great injury, and to attack its secular power, while, according to the will of God, the Holy See of St. Peter, as stated above, ought to be protected in the liberty of its apostolic office. The first evident signs of the hostile attacks were seen at the Paris Congress of the year 1856, when that Power, among other hostile declarations, Proposed to weaken the temporal power of the P6pe and the authority of the Holy See ; but last year, when war broke out between the Emperor of Austria and the Emperor of the French and the King of Sardinia, no fraud, no sin -was avoided which could excite the inhabitants of the States of the Church to sedition. Hence instigators were despatched, a great deal of money was spent, arms were supplied, excitement was created by bad pamphlets and journals, and fraud of every kind was employed, even on the part of those who were members of the Embassy of that country at Rome, without any regard to honesty and inter- national right, as they asserted their dignity in order to be enabled to misuse it, and to pursuetheir dark projects for damaging our Papal Govern- ment. When, then, in some of our provinces the sedition, which for some time had already been entertained clandestinely, broke out at last openly, the agitators directly proclaimed a Royal Dictatorship, and Commissioners of the Sardinian Government were immediately appointed, who then, in assuming other titles, undertook to govern those provinces. During these occurrences we, remembering our serious office, did not fail, in our allocutions of the 20th of June and the 26th of September of last year, to complain loudly of these violations of the temporal power, and to remind the violators of the punishment and atonement which are imposed by the canonical laws, and which they became liable to. It might have been expected that the originators of these violations would, in consequence of our repeated admonitions, abstain from their unjust projects, especially as all the chiefs of our Holy Churcb, as well as the faith- ful believers of every rank, dignity, and class, joined their own protests to ours in order to defend unanimously the rights of the Holy See, and of the Church in general, as they very well understood how much the temporal power, which is made ques- tionable on this occasion, is necessary for the main- tenance of the Papal power. But we shudder in saying it-the Sardinian Government has not only despised our ndmonition and complaints and our religious resentment, but, by psevering in its wickedness by force, money, threats, terror, and other cunning means, they obtained the universal vote in their favonr, and dared to invade our pro- vinces, to occupy them, and to subject them to their power.
			" This is a great profanation, as rights of others have been usurped, against the law of nature and of God, every law has been overthrown, and the bases of all temporal power and human society have been undermined. We perceive on one side, with the greatest grief, how useless woald be all urther complaints against those who, like deaf adders, closo their ears, and who do not listen to four complaints and admonitions, and, on the other side, we feel what the cause of our Apostolic See and the whole Catholic world requires for stigmatizing the attempts of those wicked men, in order not by tarrying to prejudice the dignity of our grave office. It resulted that, faithful to the examples of our illustrious predecessors, we exer- cise that authority which gives us the power to loosen and to bind, in order to employ the neces- sary severity against the guilty, and to give a salu- tary example to others.
			" Having invoked the light of the Holy Spirit In private and public prayers, and havina taken the advice of the rev. brothers the Cardluals of our holy Romish Church, we declare in accordance with the authority which we hold froma Almighty God and the most holy apostles Peter and Paul, and also in accordance with our own authority, all those who have taken part in the sinful insur- rection in our provinces, in usurping, occUpying, and invading them, or in doing such deeds as we

			complaiLed of in our above-mentioned Allocutions of the 20th of June and the 26th of SeDtember of the last year, or those who have perpetrated some of those acts themselves, as well as those who have been their warranters, supporters, helpers, counselors, followers, as well as those who connived. at executing the above-men- tioned deeds under whateverprentence, and inwhat- ever manner, or who perpetrated them themselves, to have taken on themselves the atonement of the major excommunication and religious punish- ment as they are determined in our Apostolic Constitution, and by the decrees of the Gene- ral Council, especially that of rrent (Sess. 22, chap. ii. on Reforms); and, if necessary, we excom- municate them again, we anathemize them, further declaring that they are to lose all privfieges, and graces, and indulgence- which they enjoyed until now froni oar Papal predecesors, aild that they can- not in any manner be released or abso1vei o '=f
			censures by any one except ourselves or the Romiab Pontiff then reigning, except at the moment of death, but not in the event of their recovery, when they are again subject to the above punish- ment, and are unable to receive any absolution until they have retracted, revoked, annulled, and abolished in public all they have committed, and have brought everything back fully and effectively to its former state, and have given complete sati3fac- tion to the Papal Power. Therefore, all those who in the remotest manner have participated in those deeds, and also the successors in their offices, are liable to such revocation, retractation, abrogation, and abo- lition of the above-mentioned sins, to do so per- sonaUy, in reality, and in truth, and to give the ful satisfaction they owe to the Holy See, and under no pretence to be released and freed, but to always re- main bound by it until they are worthy to obtain the beneft of absolution; thus we declare by the present letter.
			" But in being obliged by sad necessity to fulfil this part of our duty, we do not forget that we represent Him on earth I who wishes not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be con- verted and live, for He came into the world to seek and to save those who die.' Thereforein ferventprayer we implore, and we ask unceasingly, in the meek- ness of our heart, the mercy of the Almighty, to en- lighten by the light of His holy Grace, and by His almighty virtue to lead back to the path of salva- tion all those against whom we have been obliged to employ the severity of the religious punishments.
			" Herewith by this letter and all its contents, and all that has been said above, we order all who have participated in any way or in any manner, of whatever rank, dignity, or class they may be, or whether they are individually men- tioned or not, for whose sake the present letter has been written, and who are not sufficiently desig- nated, or who for any reason or pretence whatever should doubt the signature or thevalue of this letter or who should be brought before justice, and should appeal against it, or who should ask for grace, that this document is and shall always remain and be considered valid, and shall be invariably and incontestably observed by those to whom it refers; they shall be responsible before every judge or deputy, also before the auditors (auditores) of the Apostolic Palace, and be- sore the Cardinal of the Holy Roman Em- pire, and before the ad latere legatum and Nuncios oF the See, and before all who possess or wlll pos- sess simllar power, and they shall be deprived of all faculty and authority of judging or interpreting ; and that if they do, it shall be declared invalid. As the present letter, as is well- known, cannot be safely published everywhere, and especially sa such places where it would be most required, we will that this letter, or copies of it, shall be posted on the doors of the Lateran Church, on those of the church of the Prince of the Apostles (basilca principis apostolorum), on those of the Apostolic Chancery and General Curia (curia generalic) in Ho?de Citatoris, and at the corner of the field of Flora of the city (in acie Campi Florce de Urbe), as is usual, and the so posted and published letters, and each of these letters, shall have the same power upon everyone whom it concerns as if they had been presented nominatism and pcr- soruatiter.
			" NVe order that translations as well as copies of the printed letters shall be signed by some public notary, and sealed by some person who holds an ecclesiastic dignity; their testlmony shall be receivable in every place and in every country, as well in courts of justice as in any other place, they shall be as valid as if they were presented and delivered personally.

			PR:EsRVATiON OF LIFE: rPom SHownErc.-A meeting of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution was held yesterday at its house, John-street, Adelph2, lr. Thomas Baring, 1LP., In the chair. There were also pre- sent among others Lord Henry Cholmondeley, Sir Edward Perrott, Mr. W. H. Harton, Adrmlra Sir Thomas Herbert, LC.B., and other gentlemen. Mr. Lewis, the secretary, read the mlnutes of the previous meeting. A reward of 131. was voted to the crew of the institution's lifeboat stationed at Pailing, on the Norfolk coast, for putting off In the night and rescuing the crew of seven men from the brig E:liz, of North Shields, whlch during a heavy sea had missed stays, and was totally wrecked off Palling on the 16th ult. A reward of 101. was also granted to the crew of the Winter- ton lifeboat, on tbe same coast, belonging to the society, for going off In her and saving the crew of eight men from the brig George and James, of London, which during a fearful gale of w2nd had stranded off Winterton. The Callercoats
			.feboat, belonging to the instltation, had also recently been instrumental in assistlng to bring safely to shore a fishing coble and her crew of three men. The lifeboat's crew had declined to make any claim for helping their com- rades in dstress. A rewardof 171. was voted tothe crew of the Portmadoo lifeboat, belonging to the National Lifeboat lnstltr,tion, which had been instrumnental, on Senday morn- ing, lest 2n saving 16 persons in a most exhausted state from the bark Oberon, of Liverpool, which during a heavy gale of wind went down on the San Badrig, in Cardigan Bay. A reward of 11. was likewise voted to the crew of the Yar- mouth Hlfeboat which belongs to this institntlon for putting off and rescuing, In conjunction with a steam-tug, the crewr of six men from the brig Zephyr, of MIddlesborough, which was totaUy wrecked a few weeks ago, during a fearf ul gale of wind, on thelScroby Sands. It will thus be seen that some of the lifeboats of the National Lifeboat Institution have even within the past few weeks been the means, under God, of snatching 39 of our fellow-creatures from a watery grave. How many households are thus made again to rejoice by these valuable services of lifeboats I The wreck-chart of the British Isles teUls us, however, that 1,416 wrecks took place last year in the seas and on the shores of the United Kingdom, and that 1,646 persons unhappily perished from them. It is therefore evident that much stiUl remains to be done in maintaining and ex- tending the lifeboat system of the society. The sUver medal of tho institutlonhaving been presented to Captain Ridge R.N for his gaUant services m wading into the surf n Dlnurum Bay at the peril of his life to rescne a man from a capsized boat, varioas other money rewards were after- wards given for sav2ng lfe in open beats from different wrecks on the coast, ana to the crews of lifeboats of the soClety at Ayr, Te2,,anouth, Padstow, end Barmonth, for putting off with the view of saving life. Some additional liberal contributions were said to have been given to the institu- tion by Lloyd's, the Junior United Service Club, and tho Thames Yacht Club. Communications weore read from the Ambassador at this Court and the Minister of Marine of Denmark and Sweden, expressing the appreciation of their Governments of the philanthrop2o objects of the British National Lifeboat Institution, and stating that Its usef ul and practical pamphlet on the management of boats In a heavy surf had been, by order of the King, trans- lated luto Swedisb. An excellent ghotograph of a lifeboat of the soClety, supposed to be proceeding off to a wreck near Scarborough, was exhibited at the meeting. Both the original picture and photograph were the works of Mr. S. Walters, of Bootle, near Liver- pool, and reflected much credit on his artistic skill. It is a lamentable faot that in our Royal navy and mercantile marine such a thing as a really useful ship's lifeboat (except- ing White's) is hardly ever to be seen. The natural conse- quence is, that in both services valaable Uves, like those of Captain Foote, R.N., and Captain Harrison, of the Great Eastern, are too frequently lost, when conmunuication is needed with the shore In stormy weather. The National Lifeboat Institution has long since called attention to this desid6ec rm. Captain N. De St. Croix was elected a mem- ber of the committee of management. An interesting report was read by Captain Ward, R.N., inspector of life- boats to the institution, of his recent tour of inspection of the nineteen lifeboats which it has on the Irish coast. The institution decided on taling Into connexion with It the Mlargate lifeboat, and to make the station thoroughly effi- cient. The boat was presented some time ago to the town by Miss Burdett Coutts. A small legacy was announced to the society from the late Miss Anna Braithwaite, of Ken- dal. Payments amounting to 2361. having been made on varlous lifeboat establishments, the proceedings closed.
			FATAi ACCoDSNT.-Mr. C. J. Carttar, coroner for West Rent, held an inquest at the Tiger Cat pubUchouso, Deptford, yesterday, on the body of Mr. James Hnghesdon, aged 6;3, a tradesman residing at 11, Prlnee-street, in that town, who met his death under the following melancholy clrcumstances :-From the evidence It appeared that on Tuesday afternoon Mr. Francis Soddy, a gentlman residing in Brunswick-street, Dover.-road, Southwark, stopped at an eating-house near the railway station at Deptford, leaving a

The meet determtned efforts we're mnade by Mlr. Rose and the firemen to make their way from the staircase into the new mill, but besides the intense heat they had to struggle with vapourr of a must nauseous character, anLd for some time all access was im- possible. At length, the roof of the old mil falling In, there was free egress for the beat and smoke, and fortunately the wind blewi it away from the new mill, so that the firemen ha room to breathe as they worked, or this build-
			igmust haLve shared the fate of its neighbours. All its floors ware filled with the suffocating smoke, and small por- tions of the rooms and machinery were on fire but jets wece tahzen rinto each story, and after admirably sus- tained exertion on the part of the men during nearly two hours they obtained the mastery. Five jets wer worked up the staircases into the rooms, two others from Messr. L-eem- nlegs yard, and four from the roof of a three-story building adjoining. Meantime the old mill had been utterly destroyed, floor after floor falling in, and ason a portion of the wralls. Valuable assistance was rendered by the work-people, and also by a large number of persons from neighbouring esta- blishmaents, among others from that of the Bridgwater Trust, as well as by the Salford Fire Brigade. The neigh- bourinkgprfemises of MUessr. llarmby, Falmner, and Vo., generaL carriers, were in considerable danger, but at an early period of the fire Mlr. Rose stationed a couple of firemen in the rooms, and by the aid of the warehousemen the fire was prevented from communicating. Two jets were directed on the burning building from a barge In the Irvwell, which was immediately below.

			INDIA.
			(Th followlng appeared in our second edition of yess terday:-]
			By the arrival of the Panther we have received advices and files of papers from Bombay to the 12th of Alarch, Sydney to the 13th of February, and Mel- bonme to the 17th of February.
			We take the following from the Bom&amp;say Time and Standard:-
			" Since the departure of t.he last mail we have re- c7eived full particulars of MSr. WFilson's budget, an
			the announcement by telegraph of the leading fed.
			.ures of his scheme for a State paper currency in the country. Upon the whole, the budget has been received favourably, for although a good deal of extravagance pervades the speech which introduced it to the Council, both as to ou1r difficulties and the alteged prosperity of the countty, imen were getting tired of the dreary common-places of that body, and of its mani- fest inability to cope with the necessity of the times. Mr. Wilson brings a little Saxon energy to the work, and cuts the knot of our difficulties with ease, if not wvith perfect discretion. MIr. Wilson finda the deficit of the current year to be 9,241,0191., and the estimated defict of 1860-61 6,vOO,OOOI.;- and to the task of meeting the latter his budget is directed. He tells us at starting that he does not proposo to rely wholly upon fresh taxes for the purpose. The military expenditure is to be largely reduced; the civil wiUl not bear it. The army is to be relieved of all civil duties, that it may gain in efficiency what it loses in point of numbers; and, beyond the very im- portant reduction effected thereby, he proposes an amended Tariff Act, a licence-tar, a tobacco-tax, and an income-tax. The income-tax is to be levied by the aid of Punchayets, or by such means as the local Executive of each district may direct ; a very important and very wise determination. Theratesare, as stated in our last issue, 2 per cent. upon incomes of 201. to 501. ; 4 per ceut, upon incomes above 501.
			" The continued exemption of indigo from ex- port duty, and the raising, of the import levy upon yarns from 5 to 10 per cent., have created consider- able remark; but it is not likely that any active opposition will be raised to any part of the budget.
			"The plan proposed by Ylr. Wilson for a State paper currency is stated in a telegraphic message from our special correspondent to be the following-
			"I' The present Issue of notes by the Bank of Bengal, the Bank of Madras, and the Bank of Bombay is to cease.
			" ' Commlssioners are to be appointed to control the now issues of State notes, which may be had for cash at all treasuries.
			" ' Notes issued from distrlt treasuries will bh convertie ble .n demand at those treasuries, and at the Presidency treasury also.
			" 'N lotes issued from the Presidency treasuries will be convertlible thoreab alone, and will not be payable at district treasuries.
			" 'A s socurity against these notes, every treasury Is to retain one-third the amount of lIt issues in cash; the re. malning two-thlrds are to be invested In Government secu- rities.
			" ' The profits accruing from the issue are to belong to the State.
			"'There is to be a uniform State paper currency, the notes constituting a legal tender. They are to vary in amount from 5r. to 1,OOOr.
			" 'India to be divided into circles; the notes issued in each circle to be also a legal tender at the Presidency of that circle.
			" ' An Issue Commilssioner to be appointed for each Pre- sidency, and a Deputy-Commissioner for each circle. These officers to be responsible only to the (Home) Council for India-not to the Indian Government.
			"'The reserve of coin is to equal one-third of the Issue.
			"'Merchants buUion immediately exchangeable for notes on the treasury.
			" ' There is not to be a rold cnrrnev.n
			I I The reader who is acquainted with the history I of monetary science during this century will hardly need to be told that the plan here outlined is a very close, not to say servile, imitation of Ricardo's Plan for a Natioawl Bank, published in 1824. One great merit of Air. Wilson's seems to be that he is a very safe man, following the broad highway which the great pioneers of modern economy have cut out for us. Gentlemen who had been calculating upon the setting free of the cash balances will of course, be grievously disappointed to find that' not a note is to be issued that is not paid for in bullion. The subsequent investment of the funds in securities will be a delicate operation, requiting much discretion and political knowledge in the Commissioners, the rendering of whom indepen- dent of the Indian Government is, of course, impe- rative. It would have been most unwise to follow the recommendations of the Saturday Be- viewz and others, who were desirous of seeing the balances liberated for the sake of reducing the an- nual amount of dividends. Such a course was too dangerous to be permitted. If Government want money, it should be obliged to raise it in the legitimate way,-by taxing the people, by the issue of Exchequer bills, by funded loans, or by borrowing In any other way; but in no case should it be allowed the power of creating money itself, nor of borrowing of those to whom that power is intrusted.
			"C The wretched system upon which the Indian accounts have hitherto been lkept was well ilustrated in the course of Mr. WVilson's speech in introducing the budget. On the faith of the estimates sentfrom this country, Sir Charles Wood assured the House of Corumons, on the 1st of August last, that the de- ficiency of income as against the expenditure of the current year would be 10,250,0001. Hlardly was the intimation received in Calcutta than a new balance-sheet was published in the shape of a eaespatch to the Secretary of State, reducing the deficit from 10,250,0001. to 6,499,9811. No- thing was now heard on all hands but congratula- tions upon our improved prospects, when, after six months of happy delusion, Mr. Wilson presents us with a third and final estimate, raising the deficit to 9,290,129., and explaining how the discrepancy has arisen. Stated in short, the balance-sheet of the sear stands as followvs:
			Estimated Indian Expendituro ... . �41,770,008 Estimated Home Charges ... ... 5 S ,507,020
			Estimatod Recelpts ... �37.706,209 �47,277,028 Estimated Railway Receipts .., 330,700
			38,036,909 Deficit ... ... �9,240,119
			xv e are not responsiblo for the trifling discre- pancy manifest in these figures; the error lies in Mr. Wilson's statements, or in the report thereof. But we wish to direct the attention of our readers to the way in which the vast discrepancy between the present balance-sheet and that of September last arises. It Is accounted for, then, as follows "'Omission of Railway Dividends, 1,164,0001.
			less receipts, 330,70oz. ... ... � 83 3,300 Error in the Estimated Military Expendittre
			of Bombay ...-... ..0. . 00,000 " Error in the Estimated Commissariat Expen.
			diture of Madras ... ... ... ... 300,000 "'Error in the Estimate of Rome Charges . 640,490 'Error in Estimating what the new Taxes
			would realize ...-. ... ... ... ... 775,000 Cc Anything more discreditable than this schedule it were hardly possible to publish. And it is this system, whose failure in every department is thus manifest, that Sir James Melville so warmly de- fended when replying to Sir Charles Trevelyan's strictures thereon before the Committee of the Com- mons in 1853. 3et the reader note the first item. It is really incredible, if we had not 3Ir. Wilson's word for the fact, that no account was taken in the estimates of September of the milion of railway dividends payable during the year. We find Bom- bay figurlng next in the schedule for a trHifig error of 600,0001., and then Madras for 300,0001., and lastly the India-house for 640,0001. It is t-ime that a system so wretchedly loose were exploded, and we shall look impatientlyfor the change that is promised from a system of carefully prepared estimates,which no department wil be alowed to exceed.
			c" O news there is literaB y nothing to commund- cate. The VicerDy has reached the north-west limit of British India. fe arrived at Peshawur, accom- panied by the Commander-in-Chief, on the 22d of February. At a distance of five miles from the city their Excellencies were received by the Com- missioner and some young chiefs of the division. At about a mile from the city, Major-General Sir Sidney Cotton, and the ]Deputy-Commissionera of Peshawur and other distrfcts, attended by the chiefs and principal native gentlemen, were waiting to convey the Viceregal party to the residence of the Commissioner, where the Viceroy receive' an addrews, written in letters of gold, from the chiefs and residents of Peshawvur.
			" The rebels have melted away. With the ex- ception of Feroze Shah, Adil Mahomed, and a few
			others, all the leaders have been trapped. The Terai may be said to be cear. The Begur and h1er son, Birjis Eudr, are at Nya Kote, and it is thought that Jung, Bahadoor willwink at their remaining there, as certainly we shaTL The survivors among the-cwomen zho led with the rebels into Nepaul have been sent into the interior, and vill doubtless intermnarry with the 1epauese, there being a lack of women among the hill men. The Ksepaul troops still send in parties of rebes-iclly wretched, and covered with vermin.
			"A small force of 150 British and 100Guicowaes troops, with four guns, has marched from Barods to Rajpeepla, to settle one Damjee of Sagbarrs, who has been restive for some time past.
			" The Waghers In the Dwarka district are said to have settledc down quietly. Whether the country will be restored to theGulcowarremaius to beseen."

Yet it were better, surely, for the pour glrl herself that her requesl should not be complled w,ith. Timne may obliterate the re- membrance of even her sorrovs, and it were no real kind- ness to her to obey what wild wishes her present morbid nervousness of feeling may suggest. It Is necessry, t��, that the Government shonld vi]ndicate its own dignlty andE justlce by ascertaining the true particulars of this sad story, and ynishing the gusty parties vdth relentless severity."

			COMMEIAL INT:T GENCE.
			( iFROM BOiMAY Tnls AND ST&amp;NDA1R.)
			SATURDAY EVEN'2G, MAIBCH 10.
			Our last anvices mentioned the intention of the Financial Minister to introduce a State paper cumency intoDIndIa, and since then the details of the scheme have reached u by telegraph. It will be safficient here to mention that the present fssue of notes from the three Presidenoy banL-s Is to cease; that notes issued from tho district treasmries w ba convertible on demand at those treasmies and at the Pre- sidencles; and that each treasury is to retain equal to one.. third of its isses in cash, the otber two-thirds remaining Invested in Government securities. The part which most interests the mercantile community Is the question as it re- lates to the Presldency banks. Some compensation must be given them for taling away the privileges they enjoy by charter, and, should it be done by a loan from Government of State notes without interest to the extent of the present issues of their own, their posibion will reemaSn virtually the same. This coursevouldprobably be much more beneficial to the public than putting the banks in theposltion of exchange establishments, the only other apparent mpthDA of placmg within their reach profits equal to these of which they are to be deprived.
			Money continues in good demand, at the rates last ad- vised, of 9 per cent. for advances on cash credits with Go- vernment securities, and 10 per cent. dlscount for three months' prlvate paper. In the bazaar much scarclty pro. valls, tending greatly to limit the operations of dealers in
			fmnnAct
			Governimentsecurities havo been more quiet sinco our last, and the fluctuatIlons inconsiderable. At presentthere is not much demand, and the dosing prices are for Fonrs, S44; for Fives, 96i; and for Five-and-a-Half per Cent. paper, 102A per cent.
			We have again to report great languor in the inquiry for cotton piece goods, chiefly caused by the tightness of money in the Bazaar. It Is said, however, that the Mnrwarries, who up to this time have been doing nothing, have plenty of np-country orders; and, as the exchanges aTe beginning to be more in their favour, thoy may be expected to conr menco purchases, now that the Hoolee Saturnalia is at au end.
			The sales of gray shirtings have been small, and the de- mand languid. The greater part of the business has beem done at a reduction of about 2 armas per piece for both 40i and 45 inch widths. Madapollams are also 1 to 2 nums lower. Jaconots have been little dealt in, out prices may be quoted much the same as before. Cambries are 1 to 2 annas lower, and the inquiry is very small. T-cloths ar unchanged, but little business has been done. Domestics continue in very slight demand. Muls are little inquired for, and few sales havo been effected.
			White shirUngs are light In stock, and in fair demand, but no better rates are offered, and 54 to 60 reeds are rather lower. badapollams are rather more wanted, and 2 annas per piece improvement may be quoted for aU Linds. The trans- actlons in jaconots have been limited, at late prices. Cam- brics are unchanged in value. Low muUs are in somewhat better demand.
			Of lappets considerable sales have been effected at fair prices. Dhoties are freely supplied, and in less inquiry.
			Turkey red goods of all kinds are very dull, and few par. eels have changed hands.
			Twist is stil exceedingly dull of sale, and hardly any transactions are reported. Sales to any extent could only be effected by submitting to a considerable reduction in price. Onr rates nominaly remain the same; but it is hoped. that a better demand will shortly manifest itself, and take off the accumulating stocks.
			Woollens are in no inquiry.
			Of copper there have lately been few arrivals, and the market is looking upwards; Sa. per ewt. more are offered for manufactured kinds. The sales have been small, viz..-
			250 cwt. braziers, at 73r. 2a.; 200 cwt. ingots, at 64r. 4a. ; and 40 cwt. nalls, at 54r. 4a. Several parcels of yellow metal sheets and sheathing, have been sold to arrive at from a4r. to 55r. Sa.
			Few sales of iron have taken place. British bars ars wanted, and ir. per candy advance is offered; 125 tons Swedish have sold at 54r. 2a. to 54r. Sa. ; 1,000 bundles of hoops have changed hands at 6r. 10a.
			Lead is in good demand. Sheet bas been sold on the spot at 12r., and to arrive, with pigs, at 12r. 4a.: 500cut, spelter have been disposed of at; llr. 14a.; and 250boxes tinplates,
			Coals are still looking down, and the best steam qualities are only worth 27r. per ton.
			Saffron has declined from the late bigh prlce, and a sale has been made of 100 lb. at 27r.
			Coffee is in demand, but Mocha of good quality fs scarce. Soveral sales of Malabar have taken place, the prices rang- ing from Sr. 4a. to Sr. 14a. per maund.
			Cotton has further declined, in consequence of the small demand. and there is a larger stock of old crop on hand thanis usual at this season. Broach is quoted 100r. to 10Sr., according to quality, and Dhollera 100r. to 10Sr. Some ar- rivals of new Broach, purchased up country, havo taker place, and a few trifling lots are in the dealers' hands, bat not sufficlent to establish a ouotation. We do not hear of more than 127r. being offeredf. The quality is very good. Nativestalk of a large crop,some going sofar as to putdovn 1,000,000 bales, but the estimate cannot at aU be relied on. Tho sailings up to the end of February were 91,213 bales to Great Brltain, and 111,630 to aU quarters, against 61,473 and 72,968 respectively last year.
			Hemp is in rather better demand, in antlcipation of local wantes, as the business season approaches.
			Linseed has slightly fallen, but few purchasers are in the market at the quotations. To-day the dealers ask 3r. 1 4a. 4r. 12a. to 5r. Is the prico of rape, while ginqeUllhas fallen to 21r. to22r., with lttle business doing i either.
			We have no change to report In the value of wool.
			Homoward freights have varied but little, the high fiegrs now current tending rather to check business. It is ex- pected that the requirements of Government wil shortly bo satisfied, when an easier tone may be expected to prevaiL Present rates are 31. 10s. for seeds to London and Llverpool, and 31. 17s. 6d. to 4. 2s. 6d. for cotton. There is not much doing for China, but the rates are higher, from 22r_ to 23r. per candy.
			Exchange has not materially varled, and the whole of the business has been dono at or about last rates. We quote 2s. 1id. to 2s lad. for first clasm, and 2s. ltd. for document paper. On Calcutta the rate at sight is 10d0 per cent., and on Madras 99 per cent, : on China 221r. per jl00 for OG days' sight

			SounrA=~rose;, April 5.-A very handsomne new paddlebeel steamer, named the Mascilia, built for tha Pennslaran OrenalCompany by Samuda, Brothers of Blacckwall, arrived here this mornoing in charge of oap?aiu 3. W. Parchase. She left Gravezend yesterday at 8 45 a.m. passed Sthe More adt 11 the North Foreland, 1245
			casd, 5 26; the Owers Light, S 4a -tSe Nab LihtX 955- Calshott, 1055a; and anchored in the river at U11 pfm. for then niht, coming into dockthi3morning. The voyage roundi from ~raveseud wa3 one of the fastest on record, the Massilia being only 14hours4 minutes under velgh,vrgndrn the run 14 Imots per hou'r. In s aing downt
			Thames from Gravesend she made 67 miles in five hours against the tide, and coming dovn Channel she ran 1D5 knots for three or four consecativa hours. She proved herself a fine stiff ship throughout the voyage, and promiLses to be one of tho fastest and best of the company's magnificent flect. Her draught of water was 16 feet 3 inches forward, and 15 feet 8 inches aft. Thea following are her principal dimensions:-length between perpendiculars, 30ufeet; extreme breadth, 36feet ; depths I amidships, 24 feet 6 inches ; builders' tonnage, 1,919; re- gistered tonnage, 1,033, Her engines, which are built by Messrs. Penn a6nd Son, are of 400 nominal horse power ; the cylinders are 72 inches diameter, with 7 feet stroke; diameter of paddle-wheels, 26 feet. Accommodation is pro- vlded on board for 105 first and 36 second-class pasengers. The Masailia goes out for an official trial trip on Saturday, and leaves for Alexandria on Thursday next, with the Borm- hay and Australian mais. The screw steamer Behar, Captain J. 0. Almond, went out for a trl to-day, and th; results were very satisfactory. This vesEel has been tho- ro lvly repaired and refitted in every departent, and her huNrconted with Peacock and Bnchan's patent composition for shins' bottoms. Tne Behar tak-es out the mails to the Peailnsolar ports on Saturday, on her return fxora which she wlar be sent out to the Indian Station.

			(PBOMi OUR OWN? COWYrPoNDENT.)
			PIRIS, WEDNESPAY, AIRIL 4, 6 P.5L
			Letters from Berne announce that the Com- misaions of the Swiss Chambers have unaninously decided that full powers shall be given to the Government to take all the measures necessary for the maintenance of the sratZ quo, both military and civil, in the neutralized provinces of Chablais and Fanciguy, until the Powers shall have been con- sulted. A despatch from the same place says that Russia, Prussia, Austia, and England are agreed as to the necessity of holding a conference on the question of Swiss neutrality. I am assured that the French Government has not yet come to any decision, or, at least, has not announced any on the subject.
			A telegram from 31adrid, dated at half-past 6 p.m. yesterday, and received here at 10 o'clock last aight, states that the Carlist insurrection has come to an end, In a very short time after it broke out. It appears the insurgent troops refused to follow their leader when they heard for what purpose he wanted them; that he himselIf was forced to take to flght, and was even pursued by the soldiers he bad tampered with. Ortega wv, as I informed you yesterday, Captain-General of the Bialearic Islands; he ordered the entire garrison, or about 3,000 men, to embark, and landed with them at a small port near Tortosa, a town which is on the confines of the provinces of Valencia and Catalonia, and which is the birthplace of Cabrera, whose acts as a partisan leader during the civil war have acquired for him an unenviable notoriety. When the landing of Ortega was lnovn troops wrere sent against him, and General Conchs, the late Captain-General of ;ubs, was sent from 3adrid against him. The pub- lished de3patch says nothing of the Count of Monte- molin or of Generals Rio and Cabrera.
			What means were employed by the Carlists to gain over General Ortega we do not yet know. Ortega formerly professed ultra-Liberal if not Re- publican opinions. In 1843, when but a captain or major in a free corps, he was one of the first to 3oin the insurrection planned by the Conchas, 1Warvaez, O'Donnell, and others against the Govem- m3ent of the Regent Espartero. He raised a band of men in Lower Arragon, and attempted to enter Saragossa, but wras beaten off after a few hours' fight- ing. When E?partero fell, Ortega was rewarded more for his good will than for his actual success, and shared in the multitude of promotions and honours lavished on that occasion. Re afterwards entered thu Cortes as deputy for some place in his native province of Arragon; but he was generally looked upon, even by his political friends, as a hot-headed peraon, and one of the least likely to be chosen as the chief of a party. Though turbulent and trouble- some, he enjoyed no prestige either as a military or 0olitical leader. I canonly explain his appointment as Captain-General of the Balearia Islands to O'Donnell's wish to keep him out of the way during EAs absence. That he should have engaged in a mad enterprise from hatred or jealousy of O'Don- nell would not surprise any one, but that it should ,e in a Carli6t eense is strange enough. Jaime Ortega is comparatively a young man, was not Ieard of in the civil war, and began to fgure only In the successful inurrectlon of 1843.
			The despatch says that the troops who embarked with him for Valencia were ignorant of hs designa, but when they knew them rose against him. This may be the case, but Spanish soldiers in the good olddays of pronunCamientos used occasionally to turn on their leader, not because they had been gnorant of his plans,but because those plans did ot succeed; and the sacrifice of the chief was a ort of peace-effering to the Government they had offended. On the present occasion it is certain that the Mladrid Government could not have been ignorant of the existence of plots which were said not to be confined to Carlists, but were shared in by the wildor section of the Democratic party. Before even a Spanish soldier embarked for Morocco I mentioned that those parties would pro- bably profit by the absence of the army. Since then I again alluded to the subject, and in my letter of Monday last, giving extracts from a Madrid letter.
			eni&amp;on was aiso maae ox rumour3 to that effect. With regard to any attempts of the Carlists to re- new the civil war in Spain, they have not, or I am much mistaken, any chance of success. With very few exceptions the leaders of any eminence in the struggle that desolated the northern provinces of Spain foraevenyearshave dlsappearedfromthe scene; some are dead, and many have swvorn allegiance to ortaken service under Queen Isabella's Government. The general officer now commanding the Spanish cavalry in Morocco was, I believe, a Carlist, and it is certain that Marshal O'Donnell's own brother, General Enrique O'Donnell, who has just brought the preliminaries of peace to Madrid, profited by the Treaty of Busaco in 1839, and entered the Queen's service. Don Carlos and Carlism are as little cared for in Spain as the Count de Chambord and his cause are by the mass of the French people. 3Wevertheless, aided by the revolutionary party and by popular discontent produced by their rulers, they would give trouble, and it is a symnpt-om of a dis- quieting nature that such a man as Ortega could miuster 3,000 men at the outset, supposing these men not to be Igi.orant of his designs. Dukes and Marshals, Generals and Grand Crosses,who have flourished away in Spain for some years past, entered on their enterprises wiith a much smaller capital, and made their way much as Ortega meant to have done.
			a There were rumours last night that disturbances had occurred in 'Madrid, &amp;c., but I do not find them confirmed by authority. I presume, then, that they are the exaggerations which usually arise out of one well ascertained and serious fact. It is to be hoped that the Government of Queen Isabella will now understand that their best friends were not those who flattered their vanity and urged them to mnako conquests abroad, but those who counselled them to settle their quarrel with the Bfoors by negotiation, and to attend to the interesta of the country at home, and maintain tranquillity.
			A person who has just come from Nice, where he was preelnt at the entry of the French troops, and on whose word reliance, I am assured, may be placed, declares, that with t'he exception of the French Consul's house, not a flag was to be seen, nor any other sign of rejoicing. When the troops retired to their barraclks, which they did amid gene- ral silence, the Nizzards, who had remained in their houses while the corfMge passed, then made a demon- stration, but it was by crying repeatedly,-" Vire
			'Italier' " Yice Victor Emmanud P)
			After the departure of the Sardinian troops from lNlce there remained four companies to provide a guard of honour for the Empres Dowager of Russia, who inhabits the Villa Orestes. The Emperor Louis 1Napoleon has since offered the Empress of Russia a
			tqu ed'honCur composed of French soldiers. The mpress has accepted the offer, and all the Pied- montese troops have quitted Lice. It is announced that a great majority of the officers in the Savoyard and Nicois regiments have declared that they will transfer their services to the French Government. Among the general officers are mentioned General de Sonnaz, Commander-in-Chief of the First Corps, and General Monabrea, of the Engineers. The num- ber of Savoyard and Nicols non-commissioned offi- cers and privates to be detached from the Sardinian army amounts to 10,000. The brigade of Savoy enjoyed the repUtation of being the best troops in the Sardinian army, and will prove a valuable accession to the French.
			I have received a letter from Demerara, which contains news from French Guiana to the 2d of yIarch. I find that the authorities have repealed the decree by which some proprietors, opposed to the possession of land by the blacks, were enabled to render the transfer, or letting of land, almost Smpossiblo by the heavy duties imposed on deeds of sale or loases. The authorities had dis- eovered that this decree had not protected the great landed proprietors, while it prevented the formation of a small landed proprietary, and that without wishing to do so they had fa- voured vaarancy. These facts are admitted in thereasons assigned for repealing the decree. It appears therefore, that tho colonial authorities are resolved to permit s middling and small proprietary to constitute themselves. This Is bel2ieved to be the only mode of preserving the colony of French Guian3 from rumn. If the information contained in this communication be correct, the late change is due to the good sense and courageous perseverance of Monsieur de Monrayel, the present Gover-
			nor. His task, nevertheless, is not finished, and there yet remains much to be done for the agricultural prosperity of the fine colony under his direction. One of the first measure3 which demands his attention is the reconcIliation of the white and coloured races, the two most enlightened classes of the population. The fusion of these two important fractions is far from being complete, though many persons in Europe think otherwise. What occurred at the balls given at the conclusion of the Carnival is a proof of the prejudice which still exists. On that occaSion invitations were addressed to the fathers of families, while their wives and daughters, being of the coloured race, were not invited. The Governor himself was forced to submit to this prejudice.
			The Customs Department has just published the returns of the production and consumption of beet- root sugar during the past six months of the season 1859-60-that is to say, to the end of February. At that period the number of sanuiactorles at work had diminished from 349 to 330. The quantity mzde had declined by 33,586 metrical quintals, as compared with the production of the corresponding period of the preceding year. On the 29th of Febru- ary it rose to 1,199,053 quintals.

			I THE SARDINIAN PARLIAMENT.
			I (FROM OUR OWN CORRFMSONDT.)
			TURIN, APRIL 2.
			Parliament in Twrin is made as attractive as the Carnesaone, or Arch-Carnival, in Milan. An apart- ment bespoken by telegraph five or six days ago was not to be had, the hotelkeeper assures me, because the application came too late. A hundred deputies and senators from the Tuscan and fEmilian pro- vinces were waudering about yesterday in quest of lodgings, with abou' as much success as provincials in Paris at the time of the famous Exhibition-not- withstanding, and indeed in consequence of the praiseworthy endeavours of the municipal autThori- ties, who undertake to supply new-comers with suitable house accommodation and establish order and method in a branch of industry, every inter- ference with which, as with aU other trade, only makes confusion worse confounded. If, however, our prospects are not very cheering in our dining-rooms and dormitories, we have no lack of objects of con- solation abroad. You have had already excellent de- scriptions of Turin as it looks when aU paroisge for a national festivity; even that notablecradle of art, Flo- rence, is not so tastefully tricked out. Mere contrasts of colours and effect of light do not suffice the per- haps less fanciful, but more earnest, Piedmontese. Here we have the records of the past, the emblems of the present, and hints of the future. The fusion of the Italian " peoples" Into one people is here blazoned forth in a hundred stands and coats of arms, banners, streamers, triumphal arches, &amp;c. This day, the 2d of April, 1860, is for Italy a second Pontida, with this difference only, that at Pontida, in the middle of the twelfth century, only the cities convened, and for a temporary confederacy. Here we have town and country-an annexation, and not a league-a bond of union meant for eternity. Even in its palmy days the Lombard League never num- bered one-third of the Italian communities here re- presented. Towns which joined at Pontida for the first and only time in Italian annals,which have gone asunder for ever since-towns which had borne the deadliest enmity against each other, and ruthlessly and releatlessly conspired to each other's destruction-Pisa and Genoa, Milan and Pavia, Parma and Piacenza, the cradle of Dante and his tomb-Italian genius in its various de- velopment, the various schools of Italian art-all is gathered here. With the exception of Mantua and Paduna, Verona, Viceuza, and Venice, the very soul and heart of Italy is here; for, although the new kingdom acknowledging the sway of Victor Emmanuel II. does not make up even one- half of the land and population of the Peninsula, still there is no doubt that in point of glorious tradi- tions, lofty achievements, mental culture, and moral worth this upper portion of Italy is also the nobler one. Out of Rome aud Naples Southern Italy pre- sents little more than a dreary sameness of dull, backward provincial towrns-towns like Taranto, Reggio of Calabria, Fano, Fermo, and ever so many others, which not only are nothing at the present time, but have no traces of ever having been more than nothing in days of yore.
			I embarked on board the Royal screw frigate Maria Adelaide, commanded by the Admiral, Persano, and conveying from Leghorn to? Genoa the flower of the Tuscan senators and deputies. The night, Saturday to Sunday, was calm and balmy, light as day with the moon, and so summer-warm that we sat on deck with all our wrappings off till a late hour. Several of the honourable gentlemen had their ladies with them, and the talk was warm and genial, such as became people bent on a great mis- sion, going to meet an eventful, but as yet dark and perplexingfuture. The Admiral is also returned to the House of Deputies, and his attentions to his future colleagues wrould have been but natural even in aman whose character for the most high-bred courtesy, no less than for the most dashing galan- try, was less firmly established than that of Count Persano. Welanded at Genoa in the morning, and reached Turin at 3 in the afternoon What man, who has been absent from the Sardinian capital for the last nine months, wouldhaverecognizedhis sober and even somewhat dismal acquaintance of former years ? The streets were crowded with people moving about with one object-to view the prepa- rations for the festa; to-day the business of the same multitude is to see thefesa itself. There Is no lack of grumblers, indeed, who profess themselvea sick to death of this porpetual holyday, "this eternal waving of banners, this patriotism of demonstra- tions, this enthusiasm of the lungs, which keeps 12,000,000 of freemen perpetuaUy bawling and singing and rollicking about, turnig both triumphs and defeats, marches and funerals, Te Deums and I fi.sereres, into rareeshows-into as' many occasions
			for shirking work, and loitering about. Are charters and constitutions, freedom and annexation, only granted to the Italians to make up for the masses and processions, the pomp and circumstance of which begin to pall on a priest-contemntng if not God-forgetting populace and is Italy so rich in gunpowder that she can afford to waste millions in tin flowerpots, silk rags, and oil lamps?"
			Patience, good friends ! Christmas comes but once a year; the gathering together of a people once only in many centuries-a fusion of races effected by love and sacrifice, by political wisdom, and perseverance, is an event the world never pro- duced before, and may, perhaps, never exhibit again. Excitement and elation are but too natural to the Italians in this present crisis; it is in the nature of these people that their feelings should thus manifest themselves, and it is, perhaps, the duty of their rulers thus to minister to their tastes and pleasures.
			The eve of the festa was already a great festa, hardly to be outdone by the grand day itself. This morning we were all up betimes-some hundred thousand of the natives of Turin, and at least half as many of its floating population. The King had to open Parliament.
			In order to open Parliament the King has only to issue forth from the quadrangle, encompassed on three sides by the Royal Palace, and opening on the fourth side into the broad square called Piazza Cas- tello, in the centre of which, to the left hand of the King as he rides forth, rises the Palazzo Ma- donna-that quaint edifice with a French front of the 1ith century, and Italian turrets at the back of the l4th-a part of which is occupied by the Senate or Upper House of Parliament.
			The vhole of Turin and of its foreign visitors, all the gay trappings and tinsel and frippery with which it decks itself, must be condensed in this its central
			square, and the stiff, straight streets opening into it at right angles. The whole of Turin is inthe square and streets, save and except those whom either business, or favour, or a good pair of elbows brinDg within the precincts of the Palace itself.
			The Palace itself is a quaint and almost grotesque medley outside; inside it has a magniLicent, truly Italian, giant staircase, and a still more gigantic hail, hickh was once meant merely for a vestibule, or anteroom, and is now turned to the purposes of a Chamber, or, as the English would say, a " House."
			Within this hail, which is nearly twice as high as it is either long or broad, an amphitheatre has been erected; on the steps are the Eenators' seats, above these the galeries for the diplomatic and fashion- able audience. In a solemnity like the present one- " a Royal sitting," as it is caUed-the throne is reared up in the inside of the arena, on the right of the King as he enters.
			Soon after daybreak, as I am told, ladies and gentlemen began to take their seats in the triune, or galleries, as their ticklets entitled them. When I entered, at 10 o'clock, it was difficult to find even standing room. Half an hour later the place was "cram-full." By this' ime the senators began to enter pell-mel *; with them the deputies. Towards 11 they had all taken their seats, without distinction, when a dapping of bands announced the arrival of the Royal family. Two young Princos, one on each hand of the Duchess of Genoa, sat on the front seat of the central gallery; behind them was a numerous staff of bestarred Court grandees.
			Almost instantly afterwards the haU shook with a thunder of mingled cheers and plaudits. The King walked in, crossed the hall with his firm step, and took his seat on the throne. His Ministers stood around and behind him; as the shouts ceased, a voice-that of the new Minister of State, Count Sclopis, I believe-called out,-" Signori Se7atori e Deputcii, il Re v'invit u asedere." The same Ministcr proceeded to administer the oath to the senators, reading the form, and calling out the ecnators by an appel-ncmninal, upon which every man, as his turn came, rose and spoke the word " Gituro I"
			The same ceremony was gone through with the deputies, the Home Minister, Farini, administer- ing the oath to the L ower House.
			As the names were called in alphabetical order, a man familiar with Italians of distinction in the dif- ferent provinces could not help being struck with thejuxtaposition of names and persons, many of whom, though known by reputation to each other, some to all Italy, and even to all Europe, had never, perhaps, held any intercourse with each other, and had, indeed, nothing in common but the language of which their respective dialects are so many branches, men of all parties, men of all professions, of al ranks, and, indeed, of all character, met here -old, stubborn, Piedmnontese pig-tailed gentlemen, young, hot-headed Lombard and Tuscanidemocrats, the blood of Strozzl and Pepoll, the iiterary genus of Manoni and Tommaseo, the scientific leaning of Panizza and Iaetti, the military valour of La Marmora and Cialdini, together with the intel- lectual and moral worth of enslaved Italy, repre- sented by illustrious eciles from Venice, Rome, and naples, such as Tecch'o, Mamiani, Sforza-Cesarnl, Poerio, Scialoia, Tommasi, Imbriani, and many others.
			The appel was over; the King's speech was handed to him. In despite of irregularity, and even oddity and wRidness of features, the King has it in his power to be very dignified no less than ex- ceedingly gracious; he reads with ease and compo- sure, with a wonderfully clear, manly, mellow voice, with an accent which is certainly not Tuscan or Roman, but neither Is it harshly or unpleasantly Piedmontese. In spite of the vastness of the hall and multitude, I do not think one word of the speech could be lost by any person who had ears to hear. There was enough almost in every sentence to sink deep into the hearts of all [assembled, and give rise to a deep and lasting emo- !fion. The speech was such as one might expect from
			the logic of a Cavour fashioned after the rhetoric of Farini. I believe this latter historian for some timo has had a hand In the drawing up of documents of this nature, but in the present instance there evi- dently were phrases which so strictly belong to the conventionalities of the written langulago that the good King, who is so much more of a sportsman and warrior than of a scholar, would hardly read them without wincing as at something he was unused to-something the exact bearing of which he must take on trust.
			I subjoin the translation of the Royal speech, although a summary of it, at least, must by this time have reached you by telegraph:-
			"SignoriSenatori, Sinori Dcputti,-
			"When the last time I opened Parliament, in the midst of the sorrows of Italy and the daegers of the State, my faith in Divine jusUce Inspired me with good trust in our fortunes.
			" In a very short time an invaslon was repulsed, Lom- bardy was freed by glorious warlike deeds, Central Italy was freed by wonderful popular wisdom, and here are now gathered around me the representatives of national rights and hopes.
			" For so great a happiness we are indebted to a magna- nimous ally, to the bravery of his troops and of our own, to the unanimity and perseverance of the people-we are indebted to God, without whose superhuman aid such en- terprises, momorable to the present and futare generations, could not have been accomplished.
			" Out of gratitude to France, for the sake of Italy, to cement the union of the two nations, whose origin, prin- ciples, and destinies are common, a sacrifice was necessary, and I have made the one which was dearest to my heart.
			" With reserve of the suffrage of the people, of the con. esnt of Parliament, and with due regard to the rights se- cured to Switzerland by virtue of international laws, I have stipulated a treaty of anneration of Savoyand of the county of Nice to France.
			"I Many are the difficulties we have stm to contend with, but I rely on public opinion and the love of my people, and shall not suffer any violation or diminution of their rights or freedom.
			" True to the creed of my fathers, and, like them, con- stant in my homage to the supreme Head of the Church, whenever it may happen that the ecclesiastical authority should employ sphritual arms In support of temporal inte- rests, I shall find In my steadfast conscience and in tho very traditions of my ancestors the power to maintain clvil llberty In its Integrity, and with it my own authority-that authority for which I hold myself accountable to God and my people only-
			" The i:mllan provinces have received an organization similar to that of may ancient States. In Tascany, which has laws and an organization of Its own, a special provi- sional arrangement was found necessary.
			" The shortness of time and the rapidity of events have interfered with the drawlng up of the Bills wbich must give order and strength to the new State.
			|" In the first period of the present Leglslaturo you wil therefore only bo called upon to disous3 matters of urgent importance. My Ministers wllM afterwards, upon due con- sultation, propound the plans which will bo laid before you for your deliberation.
			" We shall found our Constitution on political, military, and financial unity, as well as the uniformity of cvil and criminal legislation, whlle by the progressive administrative liberty of the provinces and of the communes we shall renew in the Italian people that splendid and vigorous life which under other phases of clvilization and under a different European system, was the result of municipal self-govern- ment,-a self-government inconsistent at the present day with the constitution of strong States aad the tendencies of the nation.
			" Signori Scndtori, Signori Depucti,_
			"We are now creating a new order of things; we must only see in old party divisions the remembrance of the services they have rendered to our common cause; we expect men of all sincere opinions to vie with one another towards the furtherance of the great objects of the welfare of the people, and of the greatness of the country, which can no longer be the Italy of the Reomans, nor yet the Italy of the Middle Ages; which must no longer be the open battle-field for foreign ambition, but must, at last, be the Italy of the Italians."
			ILoud and prolonged applause interrupted the King at the close of every eentence. Yet it was ob- served that his allusion to the fate of Savoy and llice waas received with less fervid acclamation.

			AUSTRIA.
			(FROM OUIL OWN CORRESPONDENT--) _ I
			I LEaN . t t -.
			The publication of the Papal interdict has pro- duced so little impression on the inhabitants of this city that the Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna and his coadjutora must necessarily come to the con- clusion that their strenuous effolts to make Ultra- montanisiz of the Viennese have totally failed. The Yolkfreuizd probably feels that the time for eocles3astic3l ban and anathema has gone by, for it observes that excommunication can hardly now be attended with such serious temporal (wediche) con- sequences as it was some cwnturie3 ago. " If the.
			interdict," says the Ultramontane paper, "' cannot now produce a great effect on the relations between a Roman Catholic sovereign and his subjects, it can place the former, as a son of the Church, in a very disagreeable position. The corsequences of the present interdict, which has not been pronounced against any individual in particular, must necessarily be of an ecclesiastical and spiritual @rchlich uind geistig) nature." The VoUksfreund laudsl the Pope for having dis- played such great moderation, but it hints that hie Holiness may, if very hard pressed, resolve on pro- nouncing a special sentence of excommwnication against the King of Sardinia. It is here very gene- raly believed that the Papal interdict applies as well to the Emperor Napoleon and his official ad- visers as to King Victor Emmanuel andhis subjects, and the more independent organs of the press do not scruple to give expression to the thought. Of the question respecting Chablais and Faucigny there (is nothing more to be said than that the Powers wisn to have it soetled by a Con- ference. The Borno papers assert that Cou-nt Rechborg has never asked the Swiss Charga d'Affaires why his fellow-countrymen did not pro- test against the violation of the neutral territory by the French in the spring of 1859, but it is a positivo fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has more than once given BL Steiger to understand that Switzerland has no right to claim the good offices ef Austria. The Imperial Government will, however, for its own sake, speak in favour of Switzerland, should the question of the neutralized provincea of Savoy be submitted to a Conference.
			Persons of mny acquaintance who have just re- turned from Vcnetia and Hungary give a very un- favourable account of the state of thintgs in those countries. In Venetia the police authorities con- tinue to arrest those individuals who are believed to be particularly hostile to the Imperial Govern- ment, and recently several respectable men have been taken into custody and sent off without any examination or trial to one or other of the for- tresses. In consequence of such violent measures many persons have fled to Sardinia, and doubtless many more would attempt to escape if the frontiers were not so verystrictlyguarded. Regular Sardinian troops are now stationed on the line of the Po, and the Austrian troops are well pleased that the volun- teer corps have been withdrawn. Strict orders were given to I,ieutenant-General Count Degenfeld, the commander of the Austrian forces in Venetia, to avold a collision with the Italian volunteers, but he found it difficult to prevent his subordinates inflicting condign punishnent on the undlsciplined soldiers who continualy violated the frontier. The commerce of Venice is somewhat better than it was, but the shopkeepers still com- plain bitterly of the stagnatlon of trade. M. von Toggenburg, the Stadthol'der of Venetla, is resolved, if possible, to open the Venice theatres, but they are taboosd, and no Italian actor can venture to tread their boards. In Hlungary the hostility of the nation to the Government is very great, and there is reason to fear that a large party now aims at a complete separaffon of Hun- gary from the Austian empire. It Is natural that the Imperial Government should do all in its power to uphold its authority in Hun- gary, but it is doubtful whether its measures are the mdst Judicious that could be taken. The police continue to arrest those persons who are suspected of plotting against the Go- vernmont, but the state of public feeing ap- pears to become worse in proportion as the prisons become full. h ungarians from time to time express to me thei fears that the Austrian Cabinet will not be inclined to makte concessions "until it is too late," and one or tro men of note among them pro- foss to think that even now conciliatory measures would be of no avail.
			The loan is not protressing favourably, and there is reason to fear that not even a quarter of the sum required byan e Minister of binance vill be raised. It is said that the Finance Department has allowed i- per cont. to sOmeU of the Vienna bankers and nothing to the others, so thayt the former have been able to offer the loan to their foreign friends at a lower price than the latter; but it is difflecult to be- lieve that such a blunder has been comm itted. A s one-fifth of the subscriptions can be paid in Na- tional Loan bonds, which will be taken at par, the price of issue is about 96; but the public is of opinion that it is more advantageous to hold Na- tional Loan, which bears 5 per cent. interest, pay- able in silver and Credit Bank lottery shares, than to invest in the new loan.
			The Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, who is now at Miramare, near Trieste,will be here in a few days. It is said that his Imperial Highness is either to be Governor of Hungary or President of the now Council of the Empire. Count Rechborg has re- ceived the order of St. Januarius from the King of
			Nanlpos .

			AUSTRALIA.
			(FROtM OUR OW- COgR3XONDM-T.)
			MElBOmNE, FPs. 17.
			Tho lTortham, with the December mail, bearing London dates to the 19th, reaohed Nepean Bay on the 5th inst., and Melbourno on. tho 7th. By the use o' even the broken telegraphic communication to Aden, our local papers now favour us with elght or nine days' later news. This time our intelligence reaches the 2Sth of December. When Puck proposed to "pit a girdle rounad the earth in 40 minuLtes," he vould have been deemed equallUy absurd, and not quite so poetlcal and fairy-like, had he mimited his pledge to half the earth, and extended the time to 40 days. Yet that is now habitually accomplished, and we know with absolute cer- tainty that to do tho thing In 40 minutes is reduced to a matter, not of impossibity, but only one of very great dlfficulty and of somewhat discouraging expense. To my mind, the only reasonable definition of tho term " difficulty" is " a thing to be overcome." We have, at ael events, by the enterprise of the press, got thethingreduced to 40 days. Fill up the hiatus inthe Mediterranean line, and we havo a further reduction to 33 days. Let that work well for a while, and I am still san- guine that a communication will ultimately be completed to Australia in the way I have beforo pointed out. On the day the Northam tonabed at the South Australian mail sta-
			tion (tiunday, t:he 5th) the Great Britain steamed into Hobson's Bay. She sailed from Liverpool one day before the Northam left Southampton, and arrived here nearly two days before her, tliss boating the mail by nearly one day. Her passage was made In 55 days and 16 hours. I believe the SSmla made her first voyage out to join the Red Sea line in 55 days and 15 hours, but there is a dispute between the respectivo owners and agents of these vessels about an hour or two. In the meantime the unhappy fate of the Royal Charter and of her living freight has raised tho objection by many that the intense reed of the owners of rival lines to accomplish 'the shortest passago on record" must greatly in- crease the risk of life. Of this there can be no doubt. It is reasy awful to put the proposition broadly-that tho wholesale sacrifice of life in the Royal Charter was part of the price tho world pays for enormons speed. Can any one doubt that raUway travelling at 40 miles an hour Involves a greater risk of accldents, cwktisparibus, than a speed of 20 miles an hor!? Yet speed the world will have, with all its risks. It Is, however, satisfactory to know that there are going hand in hand with thls samo speed other improve- ments-other compensations, which have undoubtedly rendered travelling by both land and water safer, on the whole, than it was in former unimproved times, In splte of tho occaslonal occurrence of an appalling disaster such as we have lately had to monrn.
			On Sunday, the 22d of Jannary, we were visited by one of the hottest of all thehotwindswehaveoexperiencodforthe lastfiveorsixyears. Itisdifficult,bywords,toglveanyconcep- tion of thece scorching blats. I can only comparethem to the high-dried and heated air which has passed over the surface of melted metal in a foundery. Various thermometer in different sltuations marked In the ehade 102 de.g., 106 deg., 108 deg., 111 deg., and at Castlemaine 116 deg. These
			differences are to be accounted for by the intervention of some slight circumstance calculated to moderate the heat of the blast before it reaches the instrument. For iustanoe, I have found that the wind passing under a verandah will be reduced In temperature by the time It makes its exit, and If there be creepers around the verandah-a very common thing here-the disturbing effect will be greater. If the creepers be wetted, so as to keep up evaporation, the tempo- rature will be lowered many degrees. In 1855 I had an opportunity of measuring very carefully, and, I believe, accurately, the temperature of the hot blast in the shade, and in a spot which the rays of the forenoon sun. had not reached. The thermometer was insulated, was not in the way of radiated heat, was protected by an angle of the house from the N.E. and N1N.E. sun, and exposed to the direct nction of the hot vfnd from the north (osciUating a little to the eastward and westward). The degree then attained was 117. I have no doubt that Sunday, the 22a, was as hot in favourable-perhaps, you would rather say unfavourable-situatlons. It may be thought that this degree of heat is unbearable, but it Is not so. The wind blows hard, the air is perfectly dry, while, with a calm or Eght air from the S. or S.13., I have often found a lower temperature quite intolerable. I am very sure that SO deg. or 90deg. with a southerly and moistwind producesmch more lassitude than a hot wind of the highest temperature. I have, however, seen the seall birds fall and die, and the smaUer domestio animals do the same. On tho late occa- slon the gardens were de3olated, ordinary vegetables de- stroyed, shrubs stripped of their leaves, and the unripe fit literaUy cooked upon the tress. After two or three days of hot wind, we invariably havo a sadden change of wind to S.B., with a great reduction of temperature. On the late occasion the cool breeze set in at 5 SO p.m., and two days afterwards we were shivering with cold, the thermometer standing at 57 deg. Influenza has slnce prevailed to a con. siderable extent, wlth an analogous disorder among aunmals. There has also been great mortality among infants, and I am assured that if birth take place during a hot wind, the ohUd scarcely ever rallies, the langs seeming not to acquire power to decarbonlse the blood. It Is also during these hot winds that the danger of fires-especially bash fires-is very great. The grassis so dry that the slightest spark Is at once fanned into a flame, which is carried over the ground with great rapidity, in- creasitg fearfully in volume in its progress. On the Sunday to which I have alluded, an extensive bush fire occurred near Lake Burrambeet, about 14 miles north of Ballarat, which dlid considerable damage, marching over the country at the rate of about 15 mUes In half an hour, and destroylng
			stacis, cottages, ancd growlng crops. One Wrightfa devasta. tion of this kind, which occurred dnring a hot gale in an unusually dry season (1851), has become historical as " Blaok Thursday." Tho late bush fire was, fortunately, of Ilmited extent; that of 1851 was general over a great part of the colony. The great extension of roads and cleared land within the last elght years has very much diminished the rlsk of these vlsitations, andthe greater density of popu- lation affords better means of subduing them.
			Although trade continues to be very depressed, the past month has not been marked by any great commercial disas. ter. Tnere have been several insolvencles, it is true, but they are generally for moderate, and in many cases very trifilng, amounts; and the stato of commerclal confidence is decidedly better than It was when the January mail left. The state of the exohanges has checked the transmission of specie to Europe, and the banks have boen much more liberal in their accommodation. The quarterly statement of the banks shows some improvement in the increased amount of deposits in the fourth quarter of 1859 as com- pared with the third quarter, the difference being 217,0001., whUe the debts due to the banks-chiefly for discounts- have increased about 1S,000. Still there are features In the commercial condition of the colonv which afford cround.
			tor considerable anxiety, and which ought to operate as a warning to shippers on specuation ia England. These are chiefly the decreased production of gold, and the continued pouring in of goods upon an already overcharged market.
			As to the eupply of gold, we have long been anticipating that the Increased and still Increasing application of machi- nery, and the carrying on of mining on a large scale with combined labour, would result in a considerable increase of supply; but that expectation has not yet been realized, and the weldy returs stM exhibit continued decrease. The folowing is a comparative statement of the quantity brought down by the escorts for the first six weeks of the two years:-
			1859. 1860. January.-1et week ... ... 44,176 49,626
			2d - . 36,276 32,007 ad - . 53352 45,794 4th- 31 807 32,990 Febrnary.-1lb -. 50,015 34,584
			2d - . 32,093 27,074
			250,719 222,075
			There is no doubt that this season has been more than nsuaUy unfavourable, owing to Its heat and dryness, but still the reslt Is such as no one anticipated. It may be worth while to exiiibit the supply of the month of January for the whole period sice the discovery of gold:-
			Now, so far as our Internal prospefity is concerned, we have many compensations. Much of the labour which was devoted to gold mining when " digginge was a popular pur- suIt now goes to the production oE consumable articles. Agriculture has greatly extended of late years. A large number of trfming articles which used to be imported are now moanufactured here. A great deal of cheap clothing Is now made in Melbourne. There are at least two manufac- turers of lead pipes by Improved hydraulic machinery. Saw- mills are numerous; gristmills have also kept pace with agri- culture. Marble chimneypieces and the ornamental parts of mouldings for the best class of honses are made on the spot. Iron founderies are Eprlnging up on every goldfield. All these enterprises supply on the spot articles which wa used to buy with raw gold. Thus, while we have less gold, we really want less gold. That our revenue from all sources keeps up is proof that prodaction on the whole Las not de- creased. But by the English Epeculative shipper this new feature, this gradual transition, Eo to speak, should be re- garded as a solemn warnlng. Another avidence of the ac- tivity of productive entercriso not necessarily Increaslng foreign trado is afforded by the number of patents taken
			oat annually for improved processes of manafacture. They have amounted during the last two yeasr to about 100 per annum. I have been informed that one tifling process for soaking lace or ganze cap-fronts for women saves an im- portation of about 40,OOt, a-year. A company is now at full work refining iegar. The Argus, always usefully sUg. gestive, points ons that papermlils might be established with advantage, as we noe export a good deal of linen rag. This suggestion of the Argus, whether Sound in this particular instanca or not, shows the bent of the pubeo mind. Yet, in the face of thi; sUent revolution in the channels of trade, the imports of this year are about 350,000l. in excess of last year up to the same time, while our exports have fallen oOl about 120,OOOl. The followlng are the exact figures:-
			Imports first five weeks of 1859 ... �1,412,733 Exports ditto 1S59 ... 1,330,507
			Excess of Imports .. .. 46,2G Imports first five weeks of 1SGO ... �1,761,671 Exoprts ditto iS5o .. 1,244,635
			Excess of imports ... �9517,033
			I can add nothing to the force of thcse figures properlg read. To obviate any speculative suggestion on tho sabject, I may mention that the excess is not made up by railw3 1 plant imported against debentures, the total unader the head of railway materils being only 27,SSOt.
			There has been another great inter-colonial cricket anat&amp;h
			between tte players of Victoria and New South Wales, which ended in favonr of Victoria. Cricket, within the last few years, has become quite a passlon in these colonies, and is played with admirable sEkill, especially by tho " native born." The public excitement on the late occasion was ver2 great. The Legislature could scarcely be kept together. tht banks closed at 1 o'clock, the lawyers forgot their brlefs,tht merchnnts abandoned their counting-houses to swell tht 10,000 spectators of the grand match ; and, to say the truth I do not envy the man who could not enjoy the scene. 3 doubt whether better playing was ever exhibited at Lord's and there is somo chance of to-.ting this, for an enterprisini fim of restauratcurs, who carsy on that useful trade glgan tically, have proposed to import an All England eloven ai their own charges-taking it out, of course, In the crentun comforts that the 10,000 daiy spectators wUI conume.
			Honour to Edward Wilson I The charming singing blrd which ho despatched by the Great Britain haevo arlvet safely, wlth few casualties. Out of the 42 thrushes and 5: larks shipped, no less than 37 of the former and 48 of th latter have been successfully established in the Botanica Gardens. Of 12pairsof pheasantsonly7cooksand4hen remain alive. They were unexpectar, ns tho Great Brltaii anrived 24 hours before Bir. Wilson's advices of their ship ment.
			In pohtics there Is nothing worth mentloning. TLk House has been ocoupled with the EBtlmates, and thero hla been a good deal of capricious cutting down of salarleawith out much systematic reduction. ThoLandBill has advance very little. A motion for the payment cf Ministers, whidc faUled in one shape, is to ba brought on ags'3n. When las disoused it led to a scene in the House of rather a dis orderly character, chiefly among the gentlemen i-ho unffec to be superior to ell kinds of " rowdylsm.U A measure t. amalggamste the professions o? barrister and atlouncy ha been rejected by 31 to 27.

			THE GOLDFfDS.
			(From thoe Aclboun'c Argus.)
			",The concitlon of the mnec Is never very sstLsfaeLory a, this time of,tho year. OE course, wo alludo to those o, nomadic habits, without capital or other resource for the!
			subsistence than the earnings of the dasy. The scardt) of wvter prevents very much of the poor man's groand on the different fields from being worked, and noa rushes always end in disappointment to the great nasjorlt
			of persons who take part in them. If they promiso well at first, too many assist in the getting up of a ' great ruash,' and a large proportion of tho miners aro then shet out from the good ground, and, tho finding of gold 7being confned to a few, the storekeepers have not business in propor- tion to the population around them, and both classes suffer alike. Such is now the state of afizirs at what wvas for rome weeks the most promising of our new goldfielda, Lam- plough, but where the ground bha been proved to contain merely a series of auriferous patches, like all the other dig. gings in that part of the country, and to be altogether with. out any defined or continuous lead, sO that the number o5 persons attracted by tho richness of the early discoveries fmnd that there is nothing for one half of them to do, ai least with the probability of recelving sny retirn for their labour.
			"The subject of a watersepplyfor the goldfiedds ts attract- ing much attention now that the want Is severely felt, and, as an aemkowledgment of its imporTamce, the sum of 50,0001. has been voted by the Assembly for tho purpose of constructing reservoirs where most needed. We use the term ' acknowledgment,' because such a sum wDIl be, of course, quite Inadequate to meet even a very smnal propor. tion of the urgent claims that w7il at once be made uporc Government. The works absolutely required, sad almost certain to prove most remunerative 3nvestments, would necessitate the expenditure of mlTlions, but legislation for the goldfields is not in a sulficiently advanced satte to allow of the initiation of anything like a general or comprehonsivo scheme, with local bodies to attend to the wants and colleot the rates and oharges at each place, so that little more can bs done at present than agitate the questlen. In the moan- timo the erection and machinery for the drainage of the reefs and some of the wet leads, which camnot otherwise b5 worked, is Increasing the supply of surfacolwater i someloca. liles, and allowing the resumption of operations where tbesa are likely to be most profitable. Most of the olderreefs hava been opened to the water level, and cannot be worked below this withoutthe aid of the steam pump, although the stono thereabouts generaly Improves in quality. Froe two at least of the mining distrlits, Sandhurst end Castlemeino, the weekly returns of gold have been mainly supported by the yield from the reefs, since the puddlmrs have had to sueC cumb to atmospheric infuences and abandon their znachine
			for the season, sad in both districts a few of tho reefers have had more than ordinary good fortune. Thus from one claim on the Victoria Reef, In the Bendigo distrlct, gold to the value of 9,9S11. was taken wi3thln the last five weeks, and be- fore that the yield fromthe samo claim was very high,though averaging less than thisl; and from a claim on Nuggety Ileef, in the Castlemaine district, 5650z. of gold wero obtained from 1.6 tons of Estne in about three weeks, the owners having before that crushed some equally rich lots of quartz. At the Reedy Creek, too, many of the large crash ings have averaged 13oz. and 14 oz. to the ton; but such returns, It must be remembered, aro the exceptlons, ona ounce to t'.e ton being considered a good average yield nowr from moss of the reefs through the colony; and, so much have the expenses been reduced, that oven less than this is found to nav welL
			"AGRICULTURE.
			While, onthe one aide, thopatrlotic members of the As. sembly In the House and the smnall reraainder of the Con. vention out of doors are demanding greater facilities for the settlement of agriculturlsts on the land, the farmers ronnd town, on the other, are beginning to hold meetings to draw attention to the low price of produce, and to consider what steps they should take for the protection of their In. terest. They say that at the present rates frmers canot continue their business withont ruin; but the land re. formers say that the extension of agriculturo is absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the entire body of colonists, and needful to avert ruin from tho conntry. Both parties are to a certain degree right, and both are also very much in the wrong as to detalls and the application of theOr own remedies. The farmers aro asking for protection against growers from without, while the patriota want to increase indefinitely the number of small holders, hav. ing no capital but their labour, ead whose competi. tion would be the most Injurious, for they could growr nothing bat thoso crops which are nOw or are likely without their aid to bo grown too extenrively, and exclusive attention to which has been the principal anse of the present depressed condition of some of tho followers of this pursuit. The only class of farmers who ore really suffering, or are unable to pay thelr way now, are those sub. ject to high rents, and who have trsted to hay, grain, o� patatoes, the standard colonial crops, without improving or In any way provldlng for the continued productiveness of their land. Hay, the principal crop grown near Melbourne, has become so abundant that It is certainly very low com. pared with the prlces obtained for some years past; but it stll fetches a prlce It could be grown at If produca of other kinds were raised on each farm, or if means were taken to insure larger crops. Under tho slovenly system followed by most of the men who are now
			complaining, the yleld of whatever crops they try to raise is naturally ema, and Instad of altering their plans, or removing to parts of the interior where sach a systsm may be followed for a few years longer wlth some little temporary Profit, they hav taken np the cry first raised at Geelong, but since maerged in the general demand, for protection to industry of all kind.a The farmers of the interior, however, who are fast becoming the prlncipal pro. ducers of grain, have mostly good land to tMl at less enor. bitant rents whoer the fee-simplo is not thoir own, and have also the protection of 50 or 60 miles of land carriage to enable them to compete success!olly with importers of pro- date from the neighbouring colonles and more diLstant coun. tries. This cry for protection wi therefore not become general, but will die out, as it has aLready done at Geelong.
			" The autumn shows of grain and produce are shortly to eo held throughout the country, and these are likely to bo better than nasal this year. In many districts, indeed, shows will be held for the fist time, so that comparlsons camnot In all cssa be Instituted; hutthe crops of the sesoa
			just ending wero seecred in much better condition, and were most1y of much better quality than those of the year before, so that the Eamples of grain especially are expected to be vety superior. The sveson has been rather dry for root crops, but, except potatoes, the-o are not cultivated to any extent, and enough wvni be foand on the low allUvia lands to make up a good colection fortheshows. This dYnsaS of the season has caused the farmers as wel
			as the miners to pay rather more attention to the advantages to be gained by providing for an artificial supply of water, and in all the colonies irrigation and the sinking of wells are becoming topics of interest and discussion AL good fall of rain is w3ated just now in the lnterior to cause a fresh spring of grass, the stock in many p3rts of the country suffering much from the scarcity of feed. In some parts of New South Wales there has been rather too much rain, foUlowed by destcMtive floods; hut although for days together, while the rain was faUling to the eastward of the ranges, there was every appearance of its becoming general, nothing more than a passing shower fell within onr territory. If the autumn continues dry serious loss vMn be sffered by many of the stockowners.
			"LAO10UR.
			The busy season is now almost at an end, and many mnore men are going about the coontry in search of employ. ment, or waiting to take their chance in town. The farmers have nearly completed their harvest work and the securing of their stocks, so that they are discharging most oi their extra hands,and are now only in want of a few good plough. maen, whose services cannot be rendered of muchavail while the ground is so dry. There are always the roads for those who have not husbanded their resources to turn to; but during the last few weeks every opening on these has been quickly filed. Tradesmen and mechanics are also numer- ously unemployed, and it is difficult still to ascertain exactly how much this is owing to trade regulations, or how much to an actual falling in the demand as compared with the numbers requiring work. Certain it is, however, that may men belonging to the classes of skUled labour are en- gaging themselves as hired servants, at much less than the standard rates of wages, or, Indeed, at no more than is given to ordinary labourers, if known to be active and inteligent. There are comparatively few buildings now undertaken in Melbourne, except the indispensable publc works, and the sum to be expended on these wl be much reduced this year, so that masons 3and carpenters have little to gain by hanging about town.
			" With regard to domestic servants, there has been little or no change since our last report. Men have a difficulty in Ending situations, unless married and without children, but superior women servants are In great request, and receive proportionately high wages. Untaught country girls are stiUl seeking employment in rather greater numbers than are re- quired; but even these, if tidy in their habits and willint to learn, have soon the opportunity of becoming settled in respectable families, and of rising into the class of expe- rienced servants. Girls of the rougher sort have little better prospect here than they had in the mother country.
			"RAILWAYS.
			"The works on the Government lines of railway are again progressing with tolerable rapidity. The men en. Mged on these undertakings havo settled down very gene. raly, and the difficulties which existed between the em- ployers and the employed at the close of last year have not been revived. Tho contraedorsfor tho Geelong and Ballarat Railway have had to seek the support of their creditors, but the works have been carried on without interruption.
			"The Geelong and Melbourne Railway accounts have bcen at last arranged.

			" COMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
			' All reports on the commercial condition of the oolony have for some time been necessarily of an unsatisfactory character to shippers. A review of the transactions of the paas month, while following in the s=ue suit, affords a few glimpses of hope. Our last summary left at a time of no inconsiderable pressure, brought about by over- trading, Increasing stocks and supplies, with decreaaing specle and a falling off in the yield of our principal article of export-gold. Suspnsions were daily taking place, and many firms were struggling, somewhat hopelessly, against the downward tendency, which threatened to exert so ruinous an influence on the value of marketable securities. Although money has not Increased, nor trade revived to any extent, a healthy feeling now prevails. The impending panic has not burst over the market, and confidence has shown some symptoms of a revival. There have been no large transactions, and goods remain heavily on importers' bands ; but, in the aggregate, the daily business has not been inconsiderable, and the banks have shown less hesltatHon with regard to accommodation.
			"Duing the month large sums have been receivedin Australian sovereigns from the Sydney branch of the Royal Mdint, to supply the place of the British Eovereigns which -were shipped away at the close of the last and the com- mencement of tho current year. A supplementary vote has since been introduced Into the estimates to provide the necessary funds for the establishment of a mint in this colony. It is felt on aU sides that something is neces3ary to be done to put an end to the combinations among the banks, which lead to these fluctuations in the prices of raw gold, which are altogether unaccountable to the
			inlner and to the outside public. With such an in- atitution, the standard price, less the cost of coinage, wil be obtainable at all times by the producer. In Mel- bourne there is at present verv little done, the banks being ready bu5 ers on the goldGelds at rates based upon from 3&amp; 14s. 6d. to 31. 14s. 9d. per ounce for standard gold. The bulidon brokers quote the following rates for the various sorts of the metal now offering :-for Avlnngstone, 67s. to 72s. ; Omeo, G3s. to 71s. Gd. ; Pleasant Creek and Goulburn 7is. to 75s. ; Boggy Creek. Sandhurst, Castlemaine, and Jem Crow. 7s. to 76'. ; MaryborouLh, Dunolly, Avoca, Amherst, Fiery Creek and Ararat, 76s. (d. to 77s. 6d. - Ovens and YaokandanuAh, 76a. 6d. to 78s. 6d. ; Ballarat, rs. (]. to M8s. 6d. per onece.
			"The returns from the goldfields have been uniformly low this year. The total for last week amounted to 27,0731 oz. only. The total for the corresponding week of last yearwas 3l2,093' oz. The wveekly average of the past year was 42,407oz.

			-NEW SOUTH WALES.
			(FROM OUR OWN CORP.ESPOrDENT.)
			SYDNEY, FEB. 14.
			After considerable negotiatlon Mr. F. Gisborne has sue. ceeded in settling with the Government of this colony the terms on which ald will be granted to a company under- taking the construction of a submarine telegraph between Jav3 and Moreton Bay. These terms are expressed in the following resolutlons, agreed to by the Legislative As. Eembly -
			" Resolved,-That an address be presented to his Excel- lency the Governor-General. embodying the following reso- lutions:-'1. That this House is of opinion that the Go- vernment of this colony should be authorized to grant a mbsidy not exceeding 9,S251. per annum, for a term not ex- ceeding 21 years, to any company of the stability of which satisfactory nssurance shall be given,to induco such company to construct and maint3in a telegraphic line from this colony to East Java npon the following conditions, that is to say:
			1. That the Government of Victoria shaLl make arrange- ments with sucb company, by subsidy or otherwise, for th residue over and above tho annual subsidy of this colony necessary for the carrying out of the work. 2. Thatthe perlod within which tho first cal of the subscribed capital of the companyshall bo made shall bo limited to 12 calendar months from the date of the concurrence of the colony of VictoreL In the preeding condition. 3. That the whole work shall be completed and in effective operation within three years from the present date, subject, however, to such extension of time, to meet possible contingencies, as may be hereafter agreed upon. 4. That the proposed subsidy shaU bo proportionally payable on the capital of the company as paid up. 5. That the payment of the said subsidy shbll be conditional on the maintenance of the line In effective Trorking order, and that no payment ehal be made until the ine is completed. 6. That no tariff of charges shall be established wvithout the concurrence of this colony. 7. That in the event of the net profits of the company exceeding In any year tbe sate of 1ner cent, per annaum, such excess shal be rateably applied to reduce the repective contributlens oE this colony and of Victoria. HI. That steps be taken wvithout delay to communicate with .and settle the propor- tionate contributions of the other colonies In aid of the re- spective contributtons of N,ew Sonth Wales and Victoria.",
			These resolutions have still to receive the s.nction of the rpper House, and to be embodied In the 'orm of a Bill, but no farther opposition or modification Is anticipated. l1r. Gisborne has gone to Melbourne to obtain a simllar pledge from the Government there of a eubsidy of 25,31,5?., and when this is secured he will return at once to LDndon, and attempt to raise, on the basis of this concession, the requisite capital. The amonat required will be 800,000., the distance to be covered from the east end of Java to Mo-eten Pay being about 3,000 niltes. The subsidies pro- rmlsed by the two colonies, amounting jointly to 35,000., ewfIl yield a fixed miniesum interest of nsarly 41 per cent. on tho capital, while, if the business of tho line reaches the extent anticipated, the shareholders may get 10 per cent. for their money before the Govern. ments w,ill step in to claim any share of tho profits. On these terms it is hoped that the money may be raised without diffliculty. The proposal which Mr. Gisborne first submitted
			was that the colonies should grant an unconditional subsidy of 6 per cent, on the requisite capital, but, as the Govern- ment would not hear of any unconditional agreement, and as Mr. Gisborne would nob take any conditional guarantee for less than 8 per cent., the plan of a subsidy was adopted as a compromise. The working expenses of theline are est.mated at 20,0001. a-year, but that much revenue Is pretty sure to be collected, so that the subsidy may be safely counted on as avaUable for divldend. The soundings for the whole distanee along the northern and eastern coasts of Australia, as shown by the Admiralty chats, are ex- tremely favourable-far nore so than either in the ?Aediter
			ranean or the Red Sea,-so that the line when once laid is expected to need very little repair.
			Our postal comimunication with Great Britain is once more placed in a positfon of some uncertainty. The offer of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to substitute, for a slightly increased subsidy, a fortnightly branch service from Galle, in lieu of the present monthly service from Suez, has been received in a very different way in the two principal colonies. IntereolonW jealousies are probably not much appreciated, even if they are under- stood, in London; but in these latitudes they are all- Important. The company's offer has been highly approved in Melbonrne, but in Sydney it has been regarded as both adapted and designed to put an extinguisher on the project for a monthly mall by way of Panama. This latter has always been a pet Echeme with the Sydney folk, becauso it would make their port the first of arrival and the last of departure. They are in hopes that the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Postal and Telegraph Contracts will report favourably of tho project, and, if so, then an effort wil be made to guarantee the colonial moiety of the necessary subsidy. And, so long as there Is any hope of this being secured, theywillnot commit themselves to the support Ofafortnightlymit by the Suezroute. Intakingtbiscourse they have the co-operation of New Zealand and Queensland, while Victoria finds Itself allied with Tasmania and South AustraHa. The Sydney Chamber of Commerce has peti- tioned tho Government not to accept the offer of the Com- pany, and the present Cabinet is known to take the same view as to what is the proper policy for this colony to adopt.
			A " rush" is taking place to a new goldfield ; the locality is In the south-eastern corner of the continent, on one of the tributaries of the Snowy River. This district was tra versed by our best local geologist, the Rev. W. B. Clarke on his official tour several years ago, when he found indica- tions of gold in many places, though he did not visit the pre- cise spot at which the diggers are now congregating. But, from what he saw on that hasty tour, he pronounced that, south of Marulan, a town in the 13titude of Goulburn, there were at least 16,000 square miles of conntry in this colony that could be classed as auriferous. He has since stated that he would have been nearer the mark had he said 40,000 square miles. Gibson's Plains, the spot to which the rush is taking place, is a bleak, elevated place, at the foot Of the eastern spurs of the Australtan Alps, and is snow- covered In the winter time. The gold is reported to be plentiful, but tho esoort returns form the only reliable test of this, and as yet no escort has arrived in Sydney. To encourage the serarch for gold, the Assembly has just agreed to grant 3,0001. to be distributed in rewards to the disce- verers of fresh goldfields.
			Captain Ward, R.E., the deputy master of the Sydney Mint, has recently drawn up a report in which he submits for the consideration of the local Government, and Her Ma. jesty's Government also, his views as to the expediency of establishing a mint in Melbourne, as prayed for by the colo. nfits of Victoria. He quite concurs in the policy of such an establishment, which, he argues, would more than repay its cost to the colony, even if its operation were ourelv local .
			I But he principally supports the proposal on the ground that
			a mint at Melbourne, from which city nearly ten millions worth of gold is annualy exported, mlght manufacture gold coin for the whole of Asia, if the British Govern- mirnt would grant Its coinage an Imperial currency. He argues that the adoption of a gold coinage in India is only a question of time, and quotes the letters of "Indophiius" in 25c 2'imes in support of that view ; and, looking forward to this as an inevitablecontingency,be contends that it wiU be more convenient to turn the raw gold Into coin at Melbourne, whence it might be shipped direct to any eastern port, than to send it to England or Calcutta to be manufactured. Captain Ward goes into minute calculations to show that the colonists of New South Wales have gained rather than lost by having a mint, notwithstanding the outlay it In- volved. Prior to the discovery of gold the average annual variation In the rate of exchange was not less than 5 per cent. This arose from the fact that pastoraI preduco was the sole export, and that It wasnearly all shipped during four months in the year, whilethebalancing importscanieinduring the remaining eight months; and, as the exchange was always highest in the height of the wool season, the loss fell on the producer, who was able only to get so much the less for his wool. The discovery of gold did not reduce this variation In the rate of exchange, as the new export was pretty equally dlffused over the whole year, and, as a con- sequence, the value of the raw gold always deteriorated In tho wool season. Tne bMint, by establishing a fixed price for the gold, became a local and preferable market for it during the wool sceson, and, by thus absorbing it and with- drawing it from export at that period, tended to equalize the monthly value of the colony's exports, and so diminish the variation in the rate of exchange which had been previously caused by inequalities in that re- spect. He argues that the Miint has in a similar manner enhanced the price at which the Government sold its debentures, inasmuch as these debentures found a re- mittance just as gold and vool do, and the Mint retained the gold when the debentures came into the market, and so prevented them from depreciating each other by their com- petition. Two millions worth of debentures have been Issued since the Mint was established in Sydney, and if, as he reckons, their price has been enhanced at least 2 per cent. by its agency, its cost has certainly been amply repaid. The Mint at present fairly pays its way; 95 per cent, of the gold produced in the colony passes through it, and a con- siderable quantity comes up from Victoria. The Mint charges levied yield a revenue equal to 10 per cent. upon the cost of the establishment; the colonists, therefore, have no wish to part with it; yet Captain Ward, though he toucbes the point tenderly, out of regard for the feel- ings of the people of New South Wales, argues that If the British Government wUI not Imperialize the Issue of the Sydney Mint, but will consent to confer that privilege on the issue of ono Australian mint located at Melbourne, as being the centre of the gold-producing districts, that It would be policy In New South Wales to forego the prestige of having a mint at Sydney.
			In legislative business very little progress is to bere- corded. The Government has hard work to keep Its ground, and is forced to accept occasional defeats on minor points. It has no compact party at Its back, and is kept in chiefly to keep the Opposition out. The Premier, though possessing a roputation for honesty-which Is, unfortutnately, begtn- ning to be esteemed a rare quallfication among our colonial statesmen-has not succeeded in inspiring much re- spect for his Parliamentary tact or his administrative effi- ciency. On the contrary, he has been rather distinguished for his clumsiness, and his friends have occasionally had hard work to stand by him, The Opposition, therefore, has abundant opportunity for bringing forward damaging reso- lutions, and if it were not leaderless, or rather if it had not half a dozen leaders, all of whom are mancouvring against each other to get the honour of being "sent for," the Cabinet would probably have received its mittimuts before.
			The most important political evont of the month has been a vote of censure passed on the late Ministry fin which the present Ministers concurred) for witbhholding a de- spatch from Lord Carnarvon which withheld the Royal assent from the BiU passed last session to tax the squatters. This Bill aimed at desirable objects. It made the Crown tenants pay a larger and more equitable sum for the lands they rented, and which they were turning to a highly profitablo use; and, by levying the assessment, not on the quantity of stock actually depastured, but on the carrying capacity of the land, it tended to break up tho noeinal occupation of enormous blocks of land by specula- tors whose aim was to anticipate the bond jlde squatter by securing the right to lands on the margin of cultivation, and exacting a heavy bonus for transferring that right. But doubts were expressed as to the strict legality of this Bill. The Orders in Council gave the Parlament power to increase the assessment on " stock" during the currency of the leases, but not to impose any assessment on " runs." The leading lawyers in Sydney said the Bill was illegal. Some squat'ters stood out against it, and a formal protest was made against its passage through tho Upper House. At a private though influential meeting of sluatters the Secretary of State was memorialized not to allow the Royal assent to be given. In consideration, there- fore, of the disputed legality of the Bill, tho Royal assent was withheld,that an opportunity might be given during the ensuing two years of testing the question in thelocal courts. A despatch stating this was forwarded, and received in the colony in June last. Bet no hint of the course adopted by the Secretary of State was allowed by the Ministry to csaps. An answer was returned to England to sy that the Act was being acquiesced in, that there were very fev defaulters, and that even those who had memorialized the Secretary of State were quietly paying their assessments. This was quite true, for, though some p3id the money under protest, the large stockholders found that the Bill, bystimulating the demand for stock to put on vacant runs, had the effect of largely increasing its value, and that they were therefore the gainers rather than losers by it. The answer to this de. spateh came out to the present Ministry, who thus became
			aware of the previous correapondence, and they at once laid the whole before Parliament. As EOOU aS it was divulged that a de,-aPkh withholding the Royal assent from the Bill had been in the colony for six months, and kept a profound secret, the squatters were indignant, and loudly exclaimed that they had been cheated. They had a right, they said, to have known that the Secretary of State had expressly offered them the opportunity of appeal- Ing to the law courts. Some go so far as to declar-e that they wlvl Pay no more, and wi even try to recover what they have already paid. In all this there is a good deal of bluster; still, as the Government have announcecl that they will carry out the law, and that defaulters will be proceeded against, the question will probably find its way into the Supreme Court. The amount of revenue raised under this increaasd Assessnent Act Is about 225,000!. a- year.
			SirzDaniel Cooper has resigned the Spealseralfip of the Assembly; the long sittings and, too frequently, the dis- orderly sittings have kild u..favoura.bly on hshealth. The Chief Jestice, Sir Alfred Stephen1 has also sought a re- prieve from his arduous duties, and returns to Eogland by this month's rnail for a year's furlough.

			COM!ERUAL INTE1LIGEOE.
			I (Irom the Sydney Morninio HeralZ of Feb. 13.)
			During nearly the whole of the month of January hue!. nlees was verY dull indeed, and the transactions that- took Place 'were only sufficient to meet present wants. Since then, however, a better feeling has been exhibite, and a greater desire has been evince to operate In most of our marketsr. Besides this, the orders from the country have bad tobeexecuted, andthis has tendedtosnpportthepricesof most articles, which would otherwise have declined, owing to our markets, generally speaking, being overstocked. Although there is a considerable decline in the shipments during the month of November, as compared with the monthof October, stfill the quantity of goods shipped is quito equalto our wants; and,unle.s there is stfi come caution observedl by importers, no improvemenLt can take place in our markets. The news by the Northam is considered very favourable, hut still there Is an anixiety felt that It may cause our markets to be overstocked by spcculators, who will dotubtless ho able to turchasse goods at lower rates. If, however, this should not ateeclss, as soon as our Surplus stocks are workedl off an improvement mnust take place. We subjoin the latest, re- port of the state of the mlarkets -
			Flour, -The flour-market during the past month has been much firmer, and,olthougb prices quoted by the millers are nominally the same, still there is really an advance of faul
			11. per ton on what couldl be obtained for flour in thehbegin- ning of the maonth of January. The cargo of the Saucy Jac lately arrived has been quitted at 1.91. per ton, andl at which rate there arc stil bnyars. Thu millers quote fine flour at 201. per ton, and seconds at 152. per ton. American barrel flour Is worth 21. to 22. 2s. per barrel ; wheat is much firmer, and has advanced 1g. to Is. 6d. per bushel. The latest quotations are Ss. to 8s. 6d. per bushel. In oats there have been but few transactions, and prices are nominally 3s. to 3s. 3d. per bushel.
			Liquids.-Ale in bulk Is steady and prices remain the same us last month. First Lrands are quoted at 71. ].2s. Gd. to 71. 1Os. per hhd. rectoer in bulk is not in much demand, andI is doll of sale. Taylor's Is worth about 61. 2g. Gd. to 61. 5Os. per hhd. Bottled ale and porter are in fair request, and first brands oommanid from 9s. to Ng. Gd. per dozen. Brandy is firmer, end has ad. vanced during the pest month Gd. to 9d. per gallon. Mar- tell's is worth from lO.0P9d. tolUs.

Hennessy's quoseda%tl0s.6d.-otherbrandsarenotmuchiodemnand.Gp-eva inconsequence ofhbeavy arrivals, has declinedlIs.to Is.6d. per gallon, and first brands of low Strength and small quantities will not bring more than M2. to 12s. Gd. Whisky Inx bulk is quoted at 4s. to 4s. Pd. In wines the transactions have not bean to any great extent. Really geed Sherries and Frets are In demand at improved rates, but in ordinary wines there Is nolznprovemens to notice. The balance of thecargo of the Kate from Oporto was offered at auction, hut the rates not being satisfacotory the greater pertion was withdrawn, and is held for higher rates. Claret in bulk is in slight demand, but net so much as might, have been an. ttcipaited at this season of the year.
			Teas.-The market is much firmer, and, as holdlers have not desired to force sales, prices have somewhat recovered from the depression noticed last month. The advance that has taken place has been about 1t. per chest. GoodI ecu- ous arewot from 71. to 91. 10s. per chest; ordinary,

			ArMERICA ti4 QUBBYSTOWN.
			TO TlF, EDITOR OF THE TIME,S.
			Sir,-We beg permi3sion, through your columns (where all useful agitations for the most part find their cradle), to caU the attention of tho Post-office authoritiss and the cons. mercial publio to cer'a:n practical inconveniences which have become apparent since the arrangements for finaly startIng and receiving the North American mails at Queens- town have come Into operation.
			One of the first resalts already developed by these arrange- ments has been that the more important despatches of both English and Continental business firms are now ar; the latest monmenttelegraphed to their agents here, either in cipher or otherwise, to be by them written and so forwarded by thelast mall bag to their correspondents on the American conti- nent by the out-ward-bound Steamer, andvice me-s. Ad- vices by letter are by ewch ship received by ourselves and others, to be transmitted instantly by wire from Queenstown on her arrival here.
			By these means EngUlsh advices fuUy 24 hours later, and Continental despatches from two to three days later, are in most cases, and ou,ht to be in all,rtransmitted ech wayy; but, owing to some defects of detail in the arrangements, easily remedied, disappointments as yet frequently occur.
			For instance, American letters of this nature addressed to Queenstown are at present sent first to the Cork post- offioe, and only returned thence to Queenstown on tho fol- lowing day, wvhen the entire object has failed.
			The obvious remedy for this serious evU is that a separate bag should be made up for Queenstown, and its contents ln- stantly delvered on the arrival of each vessel.
			These observations equaUy apply to aU political despatches, and may be avaUed of as woU for the purposes of both Go. vermments as for the supply of the earliest intelgence in your own columns.
			Vhen the importance of these communications is consi. dered, affecting as they do, and as late ocourrences have shown, the marine Insurance on vast amounts of property and other large interests, surely this simple and costless re- form will be at once conceded.
			The second and, perhaps, more serious evil to which we crave attention i9 that caused by Saturday being the day fixed for the sailing of Canard's ships from Liverpool, which in consecqnenoe touch hero on Sunday. The first rwesult of this is that, as Sunday is, of course, a dics non for such purposes, no telegrams are sent, and, so far as this line of steamers is concerned, scarcoly any advantage arises from the very desirable process we have described.
			Another ill consequence Is a cruel interference with tho general Saturday half-holyday in London, Liverpool, Glas- gow, ic., attendauce up to nearly the latest moment for the American mail being indispensable in merchants' offices; whUe upon this side of the Channel, not only at Qneens. town, but along the entire mail route, Sunday, instead of being a day of rest, presents a scene of indecorous excite- ment, bustle, and hurry, and is, in fact, the busiest day of the seven-the opposite of everything that it ought to be.
			Need more be added to these considerations to induce the proper authorities at once to order a change In the day of sailing of the mail steamers from Liverpool to, say, Thurs- day, and a like alteration In the day of saUing from Now York, so that the probable day of arrival here may fall earlier in the week than at present-in short, that these saUings and arrivals should be so fixed th-at the urgent busi- ness consequent on them should faUl within the working days of each week ?
			We are not aware that the changes which we have thus taken the liberty to suggest, and for which we entreat your advocacy, wil cost one additional shlMling to the country, or cause inconvenience to any party ; while they appear to us likely to promote not only commercial convenience, but to further the more sacred objects of soCal comfort, religion, and propriety.
			We have the honour to be, Sir,
			Your most obedient servants.

			iXnomas W eidon, 27, was placed at the bar to receive the judgment of the Court.
			Mlr. Serjeant PAltay, who, with Mr. Sleigh, appeared on behalf of the prosecution, said that the prisoner had pleaded guilty to a miscdemeanour, in obtaining goods three months before his baiikrptoy, with intent to cheat his creditors ; and he was also indictedI for felony, in not surrendering to pass his examination at the Bankruptcy Court. After a careful examination of the evidence he and his learned frienLd had came to the conclusion that there would ho great dulli- cnlty in supporting the oharge of felony, and they therefore proposed net to offer any evidence in eupport of It. With regard to the other charge, he was Instructed to state) that there was reason t-o believe that the prisoner had been made
			thdpe of another person, much older than himsdlf,ad who, aLn reality, appeared to have reaped the whole benefit of the transaction.
			Mrx. METCALFEx, who appeared for the prisoner, Ealdi there was no doubt that the offence had been committed under the circumstances stated by his learned friend, end that the prIsner ad een ed nto he ommisio of the offence

			Mr. COOPER applied to the Court to decide upon the ap- plication he had made on the previous day in reference to the indictment preferred by the IRev. Mr. Hatch against a6 chi-Id named Eugenia Plummer for peejury on a charge of indecent assault, of whioh he had been convict-ed upon her evidence. His application wasthat her fathernmight heper- mitted to enter into a' recognizance for the appearane of his daughter at the next session, sand that he should be per- moitted to have a copy of the indictment that had been found by the grand jury.
			Mr. TnsrsAL A:ernesose said he was InstructedI to oppose the application on behelf of the R1ev. Mr. Hatch. Ho was mnost anxious that the case should ho disposed of at the pro- rentsesion, and as the defendant had had amnple notice of the nature of the charge that was Intended to be brought, and all the facts counnectedl with It, he trusted that the Court would fix the trial for Monday or Tuesday.
			Mr. Justlce WILLTAIIS Said that the prosecutor had no rlght to jurist upon the. trial taking phieso at this session. The defendant was not in custody, and there were no depo- sitions; and he therefore considered the application made by Mr. Cooper was a perfectly reasonable one.
			Mr. Baron CHANeNELL concurred with his learned col. league, and en order was then mode that the case should atand over to the May sesion, and that Mr. Plummner should enter into a recognizance of 5001. for the appearance off his daughter to take her trIa.
			Mr. HUmDLESTON, Q.-l., whbo came down specially, ap. pliod to postpone the trial of Eliza Weltzenstein and others,
			for conspiracy and obtaining money by false pretences, to the next session. He said that the Court would not sit on
			It miht pobabl las morethanone dy, ad thi woud

			The COURT said it would undoubtedlybho very Inoonve- nient to have the jury leaked uap from Saterday to Monday, and it would perhaps bo the hotteor course to postpone tfie trial.
			George Brown, 25, was charged with ste.aling a quantity of plate, the property of Charles Fre(derick PFhillip.
			Mr. O'Connell conzncted the prosecution; the prIsoner was defended by Air. Taylor.
			This robbery, It appeared, 'was committed in January, 1859, and the ctrcumstances connected with it are of a somewhat peculiar character. Tho prosecutor is a gentle. man residing at 48, Inverness-terrace, Bayewater, and on the day tho robbery was committed a servant in the establish- ment named hary Anne Cragge, who had been out on an errand, upon her return foundthe prisoner in the kitchen carrying nff a quantity of plate. Tbe moment the prlsoner saw her hc said he wasvery sorryfor what he had done, and if she would forglvc tim he would hand over all the property. He then put down a quantity of plate that be had n his hands and took eome more outs of his pookets, and he was then about to go awav h but the girl Oraggs very courageously laid hold of him. ne, however, broke awa from her and ran off, but was pursoed and brought back t
			the house. Mrs. Phillips then ascertained that . theplate was safe, and the prisoner was aUowed to depart. Nothing more was heard of him until abont a month ago, when he was taken upon a charge of committting a robbery of plate under similar circumstances; and the girl Craggs and two other witnesses swore positively to the prisoner as being the man who was in possession of tho property under the cir- camstances above shted.
			Mfr. Justice WILLIASe, in sumaming up, complimented the girl Craggs upon the galUantry and good sense she bad exhiblted upon the occasion, and said that the only ques- tion for the jury to consider was whether the Identity of the prisoner was established to their satisfaction.
			The jury at once returned a verdict of Guilty.
			A certificate was then put in, by which it appeared that the prisoner had been eummarily convicted of a robbery of the same character at Marlborough-street polioe court and sentenced to four months' imprisonment..
			The prisoner was sentenced to three years penal eervltude, Sidney Dyer, the lad who was convicted O! forgery under veryaggravated circmstanes, was broughtup for judg- ment and sentenced to six; years' penal servitude, wFith a
			intimation that thc Court would rccommcnd that ho should be sent to Parkhurst prison.

			Francis Barrett. 15, labourer, was indicted for inflioting upon Robert Meredith a ceitain injury with a malicious Intent.
			Mr. Sleigh proscunted; M. Cooper defended.
			The prosecutor is a constable of the city, and had the prisener In custody for picking pockets. The prisoner had
			bensentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the pro- socutor was conveying him from the dock at the Miansion. house, and when the prisoner was on the stairs near the cell he struck him a blew en the head which rendered him in- sonsiblo, and kicked him In the lower part of the abdo. men, from the effects of which the prosecutor was stll in an extremely critlal state.
			The jury foumd the prisoner Guily, and sentence was deferred.
			Patrick Halpln, 26, labourer, was indicted for the man- slaughter of Bartholomew Courttey.
			Mr. M'DonneU prosecuted and Mr. Thompson defended.
			The facts of the crse, which have been very recently given in the police court reports at feU length, were but briefly gone into. The prisoner and deceased were upon the 18th of March at the Windmil publichuso, Camber- well, drinlfng,when a quarrel took place between them, and, according to the evidence of one witness, it became general, and atone time there were 18 persons, chiefly Irish, fighting together ; and one wltness swore to having seen the prisoner kick the deceased. The medical evidence as to the deceased's death being the result of the alleged injury was not at all clear.
			The jury Acquittedthe prisoner.
			John Mahoney was indleted for steaUng two brass plates, the property of )Edward Stewart Hart.
			Mr. Lilley prosecuted and Mr. Steel defended,
			The prosecutor is a glover and hosier in the city, and had detected theprlsoner stealingthe hrase engraved plates from the front of the shop, and on scarching eb basket which the prisoner had with him two more plates, taken from other shops In the city, were found.
			The jury found him Guiltyt, and he was sentenced to six m;onths' imprisonment.
			WiUiam Staples and George Chesterlield, who last night were found guilty of misdemeanour, came up for sentence
			The learned BARoN, addressing the defendants, said the jury had most properly found them gnulty of sending the dlseased meat up to market with intent to sell it. There was nothing to show that they had either of them been engaged in such a transaction before, and they both bore goodcharacter. Ne ther didItseem that theyhad been actuated by any sordid motive, the one being an agent to his brother and the other only the butcher, w ho got a few shillinsfor dressing the carcass; still it was avory had easo, and the sentence upon the defendants was that they be Imprisoned for three mentha.
			Mr. Sriao informed the Court that during the past year Mr. Fisher, theo inspecter of markets, had seised no, less than 25 tons of diseased meat in Lendon, end during last week 2401b.
			The learned BARsON said that the prosecution was a very important and proper one.

			POLICE.
			3DLNsIoNHODusm-Lney Rawlings, agedi 35, of 20, Cowper-street, City-road, was charged with fraudulently obtaining 271. under the following circumstances :
			Mr. Frederick Kent, of 18, Queen-street, Cheapslde, soli- citor, sald,-The prisoner was introduced to me by the Rev. B. Aldis, who in her presence asked me to discount a bl� of exohange for 371.. dated the 10th of November, 1859, and drawn by P. F. Hlunpato upon, amd accepted by, Charlee Cox, of Baker-street, Lloyd-square, Pentonville. I cannot say which gave me the bil, but I received it in the prlsoner's presence, and it fs endorsed both by her and the Ier. R. Aides. The prisoner said ehe did not want nal the money at once, but merely a pst. I objected to let her have any money at all atS first, saying " I do not like to deal with indies in sash matters, because sometimes they turn out to be married women.'; I then asked her �f she was married, and she said, " No," sh was a widow, and she offered to bring me probate of the wUl of her husband who she said, was a tallowmelter, and had becn accidentafl k�iled. I told her she must distinctly understad that I lent the money solely on the faith of her declaration that she was a widow, and that if she was not she might get Into trouble. She received some money on account then, I think it was 15., and I told her she shouEd have some more when she brought the probate of her husband's will. She fre- quently called after that and received small sums of money till, finding that she did not produce the probate, I told her I could not think of letting her have any more until she made a solemn declsration that she was not married. I told her that in the presence of all my clerks, and I eent one of my clerks with her to a commissioner, before whom she made the declaration, and it was brought back to me. Upon that I gave her some more money, I think it was 2s., to get a Sunday dinner with. Since then I have received information that she is a married woman, and if she is re- manded I have no doubt I shall be able to prove the fact.
			Cross-examined.-I have issued writs against Mr. Hun. gate and Mr. Aldis. I am not a money-lender.
			The prisoner said there was no ground for the charge, as she had been a widow for five years.
			The LORD MAvors said there was no proof before the Court of her being a married woman, bub he should remand her on her own recognizances to appear again.
			John C. Peacock, of 12, King's-row, Walworth, cooper, a man about 40 years of age, weU known in his locality as a folower of Johanna Southcott, was charged before th LoRD MAYOR with beino disorderly, and pulling down a sheet iron chimney in the church of St. James's, Duke's- plaoe, and also with assaulting Vale, beadle of the said church.
			Vale said,-Last night, about 9 o'clock, after the servioe was over, the prisoner was In the church shouting out end makitng a disturbance, which collected a great concourse of people. The reoter went to him and requested him to withdraw, teling him that as the service was over he had no right there, and that he could not be permitted to make a disturbance. The priso0ner refusedto leave the church and in thu most excited manner shoutei out that he had been sent with a message from Heaven to the Lord Mayor, the Corporation, and the cit3zens of London, that the Lord would destroy the city In five years. The rector again ex- postulated with him, but he only shouted the louder, and when the rector ordered me to remove him, and I proceeded to dose, he ossaulted me violently, and catching hold ot an Iron chimney that was in our way, he pulled It dowvn in r esisting me. We hadi the greatest trouble in removing hlim from the church, and ultimately I gave him int cuistody. It will cost 21. to repair the damage he did.
			The LORD MIAYOI.-Washe intoxicated 9
			Witness.-Oh, no, my Lord ; he was quite sober.
			The LORD MAYOR.-Well, what have you to say to this charge, Prisoner.
			Ps-loner.-Say I why that I aman imused man.
			The LorD MAYOR.-Ho w can you complain of that after behaving so in a church ?
			Prlsoner.-I am a believer in a God, I believe in a God of mercy, a God of judgments, a God of visitations, and a God who never sends His judgments on the earth without first sending warnings to the nations; and (raising his voice to the pitch of frenzy), I am cent with a great message from Heaven, to say to this city " MIene, meno, tekel, uphaissin' thou art weighed in the balances; and"-
			The LORD MAYORR.-`We, that wilU do. You must make compensation for the damago you have done.
			Prl3cner.-Dasange ! I think they ought to compensate me, for I wrent there with a groat messag,e of merey, and, lo 1 they olutehed me by the cellar and tore the beard from my chin, even as they reviled and snat uponu One of old Wss
			that Christianity9 Wa that the way t4 receive a messagoe fromnthe MIost High? Lo ! again I telt you I have got a message from HEeaven-
			The LORD MAYOR.-Stay, no more of that. The damage is estimated more highly, but I shall order you to pay 20s., or go to prison for seven days.
			Prisoner (with a knowing leer and an entire change of tone).-Won't it do. your worship, if I send a man to repair the damage and settle the matter with him?
			The LORD MAYOR.-You must pay 20s., Sir, or go to prison for seven days.
			Prisoner (in the same wild accents as before).-Lo I then, again I tel you I have a message from Heaven-
			The LonD M.&amp;YOP.-Remove him, officers.
			Three officers took him by the coUar, and endeavoured to lead him downstairs, but the prisoner clutched the railing of the doek with both hands, and held his ground, despite their efforts to dislodge htm until ho had delivered his "message." which ho did asfoilows :- Lo listen and hear. I tell yon I come oharged with a message from Him who always sends His warning3 before He sends His judgments; and now the world is told by my voice, and by the voice of Johanna, and by the voice of God, that the Lord is about to shako the earsh to its foundlations with His terrible jndg. ments. My voice has said it, and the voice of Johanna, and the voicoe of God, and it wiUl be done-so ye are warned."
			He then walked downstairs, bnt there he resumed his ravings, until his mother, who was in court, Paid the money, and he was then disoharged.
			The Loin MLYOi' requested the acknowledgment of 5 from LA. B.," for the poor-box.

Witness asked her what was the mntter, and she sida that her husband bad cut her throat. Witness ran for a doctor, and some persons took Mrs. Gay into her room. As sheweni for the dootor she saw the prisoner in the lano behind her. He celed her by most offensive epithets, and said she kept a brothel, because she had sheltered his wife when no etheo person would take her in. He also said that if she belonged to him he would serve her in the samo way as he had done his wife,whamrhocalled byanimpropername. Shereturned with the doctor, and he dressed the wonlds. Witness's little boy saw him (the prlsoner) kneeling upon his wife at the bottom of the s.airs. The wounds extended from ear to car, and she had both her hands cut in wresting the raze

			The prisoner said he had notinug to ask the wltness, but eome of her statement was false.

Upon tarning an angle he cnauht slibt of the woman sitting upon the kerhl

He observed that shb was covered with blood, and as she was holding up her hand with the razor in it to her head a person remarked that shoe had cut her throat, Sho heard the observation, and immediately said that her hus- band had done it. She was so disfigured that witnesa was unable to recognize her at first. RIe then went in search of a oonsable, and on the way saw the prisoner. He fol. lowed bin, and saw him cress over to the pond In front of the Cook publichonse, where ho stooped down and washed his hands. The prisoner then walked away very orderly In the direction of the police-station, but he saw the sergeant and gavo himself up. Witness gave the razor up at the station, upon whioh tbeprisoner piuled out the sbeath, and said that belonged to it. The razor was dripping with blood when he took it out of the ev'dus hand. There was no one near her when he first saw her sitting on the kerb. st-one.

It al1so appeared that shortiy beFore 6 o'clockr on Wednesday morning the prisoner knocked at the door, which was opened by bis wife. He then made an excuse that he had come for a little bag he had left there over nlght, and afterwards that he wanted some water to drink. Upon getting into the passage, he rushed upon her and cut her throat. There was a desperate struggle, and, as she was a tall muscular woman, sho was able to wrestlo with him and take the razor from him. It is expected she will be able to appear in court in a week or two, to give evidence against the mrisoner.

			MILITABY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCB.
			According to present arrangements, the A troop of the 1.oalEngineer Train, under the command of Capt. R. W. Duff, R.E., with the whole of their field equipment and Stores, will vacate their winter quarters at Brompton-bar- racks, Chatham, on the 16th inst., and proceed to the camp at Aldershott, where they will be stationed during the sum- mer. The quarters at Brompton-bazracks now occupied by the Royal Engineer Train wil be taken possession of by the detachment of Royal Engineers, which now numbers 500 men.
			The Dake of Somerset, as First Lord of the Admiralty, held a lev6e yesterday at the Admiralty, at which the fol- lowig officers were present :-Admniral J. Ayscougbh, Rear- Admiral Studdert, Rear-Admtral Scott; Capts. D. Robert- eon, C. C. Forsyth, G. Giffard, William Woodley, William H. Haswell, R. J. Otway, G. A. Seymour, T. F. Birch, William H. Kitchen, and C. G. E. Patey; Com- manders E. H Howard, W. M. J. G. Pasco, J. Sanders, F. IL S-nith, M. R. Pechell, William C. Chapman. and T. H. I.L 3Ln-tin ; Lieuts. William Symon, J. B. Scott, and Wiliam Scrymgour; and Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals 1'Corm{ck.
			A Court-martial has been held at Chatham Garrison on a rlver of the Royal Engineer Train, named George Hamil- ton, a man of exceedingly bad character, for desertion. The prisoner deserted under very aggravated circumstances, and ulisposed of the whole of his kit for a triling amount. On a previous occasion he was tried for desertion, and was then aentenced to a long term of imprisonment, and to be marked vith theletter " D." The proceedings and finding of the Court were yesterday read out to the officers and men on parade, the prisoner being sentenced to be again marked with the letter " D," to be imprisoned for 168 days, and to be placed under stoppages until the value of his kit is made good. He will undergo his term of imprisonment In Fort Clarence, Rochester.
			The Vulture, 6, paddle, Capt. G. Parker, was paid off yesterday at Portsmouth. The Pigmy steamer sailed at 4 p.m., with that portion of the Vulture's crew belonging to Devonport, for that port.
			The Vletoria, 121, screw, has been placed In No. 7 dock at Portsmouth. The paddle-yacht Osborne has been un- ;docked from No. 8 dock.
			The Octavia, 50, sailng frigate, has been placed In No. 9 dock at Portsmouth, for lengthening and conversion to a screw.
			The crews of that portion of the Channel Fleet anchored at Spithead had leave granted them ashore, in parts of watches, yesterday evening until 7 a.m. to-morrow. The whole of the vessels have suffered more or less, both in their hus and machinery, from the effects of the late gales during their passage to and from Lisbon. Of the five ships at Spithead, the Edgar has proved the most efficient of the 'whole, as well as much the easiest craft in a seaway. Next toher ranks the Mersey, the Miars taking next place, with the Algiers and theQueen last. The two last-named vessels roUed very heavily; the Queen, indeed, to such anextent as to unship the shot from their racks on the main deck, and send them Eying about, Injuring 15 of her crew before they were etowed down in her after-hold. She has a heavy sick-list %esides. Her funnel casing is torn, waste steam-pipe carried away, and her machinery requires a thorough overhaul-the effects of her rolling and working. She made a good deal of water, as may be supposed, during the worst part of the last gale. The Algiers also made water during the gale, and her stern Is supposed to be defective. The Mersey's steam-pipe Is defective, from its great length exposed to the working of the ship; but, most important of al, her condensers are cracked. They wil all require con- siderable repairs before they can again proceed to sea. All the officers of the squadron agree In awarding the superiority on every point at sea-speed under canvass, and easy motion In heavy seas especially-to ships of the Edgar and Donegal class, over those of the Algiers and Queen's.
			The Bacchante, 51, screw, is expected to hoist the pendant about the 12th inst. She is to have two of Armstrong's guns included in her armament. Commander Joshing, of Her hMajesty's ship Queen, has had the offer to become her future commander.
			The screw steam-frigate Diadem, 32, Capt. IL Cockbmn, left Plymouth Souna on Wednesday under canvas for the westward with sealed orders. She was detained ashorttime to receive her new commander.
			Rear-Admiral Sir Baldwin Wake Walker, Bart., E.C.B.
			,uonTrouer-Lienerm or cue iNavy, yesterday visited Wool- wich dockyard, and, accompanied by the Commodore Super- intendent and the heads of departments, inspected the new screw steam-schooner Ranger, completed for service .and about to be commissioned for the west coast of Africa.
			Her Majesty's new steam gun-vessel LandraUl was yes- erday hauled into the fitting basin at Woolwich, preparatory to being docked and got ready for sea.
			The Royal yacht Victoria and Albert arrived at Portland a lttle before noon on Wednesday, from Portsmouth, having accompllshed the distance in three hours. After a few hours' detentionsheproceededon her cruise to the west- ward.
			The screw steamship Conqueror, 101, Captain Sotheby, t.B., was placed in Keyham Basin on Wednesday, and subsequently taken into No. 3 dock, to have her leaks stopped.
			The paddle-wheel steamvessel Bann, Master -James S. Wells, employed on the coast of Cornwall, arrived at Ply- mouth on NVednesday, and went Into BarnpooL
			The Powerful, S4, line-of-battle saillng ship, has been docked at Chatham, where she will be lengthened and con- verted into a screw steamer.
			The Arethusa, 50, saillng frigate, has been bronght up to batham docky.ard, preparntory to being taken into dock to undergo the necessary alterations to adapt her for a 51-gun ECrew frigate.
			The Torch, 5, screw gun-vessel, having been completed at Ohathan dockyard, has been undocktd, and ispreparing for her tial tripo test her machinery, after which she will join the steam reserve.
			Mr. Barranses patent I eproved stean tractl,n engine, manufactured by t ressrs. Gardiner and xackintosh, at New Cress, was tested experimentally over the pablic roadlsbont Woolwlch on Wednesday.
			The outer walls Intended to forn the new wings in course Wa construction at the Royal teliotary Academy, c oolwachu which were commenced in October last by vr. Myers, the eontractor,have progressed rapidly, and have already reached Theheeight of 5ft. above the plinth. Yesterday an order was Aeceived fromthe commanding Royal Engineer, that on ac- count of thc walls being faced with red bricks,whlch was pro- n,ounced objectionable, the work must be removed and com- menced anew. The bricklayers have been accordingly dis- missed until their services shall be again acquired, and the decision has been obtained as to the aupropriato colour of the facings, hitherto given universaUy in favour of red bricks. The expense of the alteration is calculated at up- wvards of 1,0COt., which will bc borne by Government.
			The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :-Comm.ander A. 1I. Basking, to the Wrangler, commisstoned; Peter Wood, chief engineer, to the Asia, for rharge of machinery of the Sutle;, Edward J. Burnley, chief engineer, to the Coruw.alls;* Thomas L,. Walker, chief 2ngineer to the Asia, for charge of the machinery of the 1Prederiek William; and Charles Wright, chief engineer, to fhe Fisgard, for charge of the machinery of tho Devastation.

			FATAL AccmD T.-A fatal accident, attended with some rather singular circumstances, took place on Tuesday last at the Falcon Dock, Bankside, Southwark. It appeared tbat on the afternoon of that day a carter in the emeploy of Mr. Chamberlayne, a carman, was sent to the dock to take a load of bricks from a barge that was lying at the dock. He had a cart and one horse, and it being nearly low water at the time he arrived he drove into the water close to the barge, aud was about to commence loadinz. It appears that at this spot there is a very sudden fall in the shore, and whether the horse had reached forward to drink, or from some other cause, he stumbled forward inito dee wafer. Tho carter, who was in the cart. and haa the reins&amp;in his hand, was seen to make a strong effort to pull the horse up, but did not succeed, and in an instant horse, cart, and man sank in deep water, the accident being witnessed by a number of per- sons who were close to the spot. An alarm was, of coarse, immediately given, and drags were procured, which wvere used at once, but, strange to say, uo trace of either cart, horse, harness, or the unfortunate driver was discovered; and, although the search bas been continued ever since, it has been wihthe same result. The cart was a heavy vehicle, such as is nsually employed for carrying bricks, and it is conjectured that tho driver had, while struggling in the water upon his first becoming immersed, got entangled with the reins or the harness, and that the h7bole mass went to tbo bottom; and persons acquainted with such matters have expressed an opinion that, by the actton of the tide, it has been carried probably to a consider- able distance down the river. A few years ago, it aupears, a barge was sunk at Waterloo-bridge. and was never seen again until It was found floating at 'rith, a distance of 20 miles from the scene of the original accident, no trace of it hIavin been seen at either of the bridges through which it must lave floated, or In the Pool ; and it is conjectured that a similar result may tako place in tho present Instance.
			SPFCACLBs FOr.t Ssosir-sloTFD SOLDIERSS.-A. novel experlment, recommended by the Commander-in- Chief, hbas just been sanctioned by Government. Three in- fantry recruits lately arrived from England were at the nsual medical examination found to be short-sighted, and in their presentstateuseless as soldiers. The use of proper glasses, however, it was added, would make theni instantly effective. The Director-Gencral observed that if the Com- smander-in-Chief did not object to the incongruity of a soldierintheranks wearing spectacles, there could beno other objection to their being supplied to such men as mlght require them. A large number of officers asstst their sight in this way, and it Is a well-known fact that many sportsmen wear glasses, some of whom are first-rate shots, and who could not see to shoot without them. Government have accordingly authorized the supply of suitable glasses to the zmen referred to, as an experimental measure, to be zeported - apon hereafter.-adrads limes end Spcctator.

			MRP HORSMfAN AD RIS CONSTITUENTS.
			We are requested by Mr. HorsmLan to give fub- licity to the following letter:-
			"Ashby St. Ledgers, Rugby, April 4.
			"My dear Stanton,-I see by the Stroud Journal that you attended the meeting called by some of my con. stituents last week, and, as my proposer at the last election, defended my conduct in the present Parliament.
			? "I cannot but think it was a somewhat novel proceeding
			for constituents to meet and pass judgmenet on a represen- tative wlthout formally apprising him that the meeting was i to take place and Inviting him to attend, and stiU more
			strange was It that the chairman of the meeting should not have the courtesy or fairnesss to communicate to me the resolution that had been come to, but shonld leave me to get my information from the newspapers or any other acCi- dental source. In the meanwhile so untruthful a report of the proceedings had been sent to the London newspapers that even foreign journals have been able to use it largely to prove that Lord John RusseUls recent declaration of the policy of his Cabinet Is condemned In England, Inasmuch as the member who elicited that declaration has been discarded by his constituents.
			" In writing, therefore, to thank you very sincerely for your generous vindication of me, I must take this oppor. tunity of giving through you that reply to the meeting for whtch so much pains has been taken to deprive me of a more legitimate opening.
			"I am accused of having acted inconsistently with the principles on which I was elected.
			"No accusation can be more entirely unfounded. The two questions on which I had to express myself most fre- quently and publicly at the election were Parliamentary reform and foreign policy.
			"On Parliamentary reform some of my constituents were dissatisfied with my recent vote on Lord John Russell's abstract resolutfon, and my answer to them was this:-
			"' Whether I have been rlght or wrong must at present be a matter of opinion. We must wait tiUl this time next year. If you have then the large and comprehensivo measure that has been promised you I shaU own I have been wrong. Bnt if, as I predict, you are offered a measure no better or more satisfactory than the one now rejected, you will own I have been right, cud that it would have been wiser to have settled the question by amending Lord Derby's Bill without the turmoil of a dissolution and the lOss of a year.'
			"This lssue was universally accepted. It was raised in March, 1859, and the new BiL has been discussed In March, SG10. With what result? The dissatisfaction felt with the I Bill of Lord Derby was as nothing compared with the con-
			tempt and ridicule that from every side are poured on the Bill of Lord John Irussell ; and while last year's measure had at least the merit of exhibiting much thought and pains bestowed on its preparation, this new one is universaUy condemned for its careless and slovenly character, and no one suggests how, by any number of amendments, it can be made as good a Bill as Lord Derby's, with very few and simple amendments, might have become.
			Moreover, the reluctance shown by the Government to introduce their BIU, and the indifference with which they have postponed its progress, discredit the whole proceeding as emanating from the necessity to redeem a pledge rather than a desire to reform Parliament.
			"Therefore, on the question of Parliamentary reform I have little in my conduct to regret, and my coistituents as little to complain of.
			"On for3ign policy my views were as clearly expressed, and my course has been equally consistent.
			For years past I have warned my friends at Strond, at every annual meeting, that the aggressive policy of France was a storm ahead, and that increased armaments and aug- mented income-tax would be forced upon us, and I con- cluded a speech two years ago with the expressions that I see you quoted at the meeting-Put your faith, if it please you, in the Emperor of France, but keep your powder dry.'
			"Tov- rds the close ,f last session of Parliament (on the 9th of A ugust) I pretested against the English Milnistry becomln, so much the French Emperor's partisans in Italy. I warne them that he had ulterior designs of French afggrandisement, and that they would iind themselves de- ceived and embarrassed by complicity in hls acts.
			"In the bLst week of the oresent se5sinn the (T-ane11n
			of the Exchequer, wben announcing the treaty, asked the House of Commons if under any conceivable circumstances the alliance between France and England could be too close? I replied Immediately, 'That our alliance with France could be too close when it separated us from the other Powers of Europe.' This was on the 27th of January, and on the 14th of March I again urged on the Government the necessity and the duty of drawing closer to other continental Powers, and especially of combining with Prussia against the common danger from France.
			"There seened t tb^ft time no hope of such a policy, yet, -ithin a fortnignt from that day (on the 20th of Mar h., Lordt John Russell, In answer to another appeal from me, announced, amid the cheers of the liouse, that the eyes of the British MInist-y were opened at last to their grievous error, that they were now freeing themselves from that special alhance with France which tho Chancellor of the Exchequer had vaunted, and were seeeking those other European alllances that r had ventured to recommend.
			"Yet,whUleallEngland is applauding this change of policy which gladdens the heart of every Liberal In Europe, there are speakers at the Stroud nceeting, diff^ering, I venture to say, from the sentiments of electors of every party in every other constituency and censuring me for my distrust of France.
			"Extracts from my speeches were read to the meeting to prove that I was exclting war with France ; but why were these expressions which I used on the 13th of March not cor- rectly quoted? I The whole question is this, what is the policy that leads to war? Is it a policy of firmness? Because 1 cannot but recollect an occas!on, not very long aga, wlhen divided counsels, leading to compromise and tending to weakness, did drift us into a most disastrous war.' Was I singular in these views? TherCis now a very general opinion in the House of Commons that if Lord John Rnssell had de- livered a month aop the speech that he delivered last week; or if the ,Iinistry at an earlier period had de- clared, 'No Savoy for France, or no commercial treaty with England; no Savoy for France, or' no special alliance '-the Savoy difficulty never would have arisen. And I am informed that this is also the language of the Emperor of France, who complains that the English Cabinet have misled him, as they misled the Emperor of Russia into the Crimean war, and as they misled the French Emperor himself on the Conspiracy BUL
			"The resolution of the meeting condemned my votes and speeches on the commercial treaty and the budget but, so far am I from regretting them, thatlI have now the satisfac- tion of seeing opponents in aUl directions coming round to my opinions. There is scarcely an indepenlent organ of the press that has not modified its approval both of the treaty and budget. The former exhibits the Cabinet In the un- fortunate light of having extorted great sacrifices from Enbiand to benefit France at the very time they knew that Fran;s had designs on Savoy ; and my arguments against the budget have now been endersed by the highest authorities, justly alarmed by the new 6inancial policy of the Cabinet, and the enormuous deficiency that Is inevitable next year without the smallest Indication of how it is to be met.
			The treaty and budget were both of them surprises on Parliament and the country, and were burried through the House of Commons before it had recovered its senses. The forms-and usages of Parliament are interposed as securities for the nation that ample time shall be given to deliberate on public measures of which aU the consequences cannot, on the instant, be Foreseen. Bet during the present session those securities have been set aside to an unprecedented ex- tent, I protested, but in vain; and now, when it is too late, the true character of those measures is beginning to be understood, and many of their supporters are by no means satisfied with the votes into which they have been hurried.
			"The last charge preferred against me by some speakers at the meeting was that I had not been sufficiently 'Minis- terial' in my votes and speeches, aud that I had unex- pectedly and inconsistently opposed the present 'strong and united liberal Govermment.'
			To this again I reply that my Parliamentary speeches aud public declarations to the electors had left no room for doubt of my intentions.
			"Last year, on the 4th of Aprll, when Mr. Disraeli an- nounced the dissolution, I indicated my views of the situa- tion in a speech from which I will trouble you with one ex-
			trant X-
			I " ' The present Government is not strong the next one, Iif it be the result of a party struggle on reform, cannot be
			strong, and, in my conscience, I believe that it will depend on the first proceedings of the new Parliament, when it assembles, whether, in onr generation, we shall ever see a strong Government again. That will be a prospect resting very much on the conduct of those who are our leaders in this House. It Will be a question when the new Parliament assembles, not of reform nor of party, but of the permanent influence and cha Ater of our representative system. It will be for our leaders to uphold that character, and maintain unimpaired that in- fluence. 5Bt, however they to whoi we have a right to look for example in this House may discharge themselves of Itheir responsibility and duty, I hope that we on these
			benches shall remember that we, every one of us, have a responsability and a duty too ; that we shall make it known that a political party can have higher ends than office, and tbat we shall throw back the taunt which has been so fre- quently c3st upon us In these debates, that ours is
			'A vulgar Darty race.
			Smuglung by dark intrJgue for place:
			And at the public meetings held during my election I re ipeatedly stated that the Liberal leaders, by their recent mistreatment of the Reform quiestion, had disentitled them- selves to public confidence ; and of Lord Palmerston my words were, that be was ' doubly disqualified, from having trifled with lsfr,nn andl truckled to France.'
			" And, at the meeting of the Liberal party at Willis's Rooms, when it was determined summarily to cj;ct Lord Derby, I deprecatcd that hasty course, because I said that no strong and durable Liberal Administration could then be formed, and it could only be attempted by a compromise of principles and coalition of enmities tha' must eventually emiibarrass pubdic interesta and damape public men.
			iAnd holdingh so stroen-yIn re dpeating so frequently the vine hich wre the eul flong, close study of oulr Parliamentary condlion how could It te expected that I should Pcine confidence in a Miniht o that had gained power, as I thought, by questiosable means. and must yoursue an atebigurs Pelicy? That Ministry has presented sor our cntsidenation four great questions-the Commert cl Treaty, the Bndgt, the Jn eform Bill, sad foreign policy. On the twofirst time will pronounce its ver- diet, and of ta at verdict I entertain no doubt. The Reform Bill is an affront to the country; and the foreign poiiey of the Cabinethas producedsuch complicationsthatitisdiff- 'cult to see how it can escape uncenswred.
			" It was my duty asnd my determination to deal w~ith ev-ery measure of the Government as it deserved. Several of my constituents wrote to me expressing a hope that I would support the treatg I gave them very fully my rca- sons for not doing so. iedthey not know Ishould at uon them? In the month ofJ3anuary,1 iS7l,Iwas summoncato a meeting of my constituents of whom no less than 500 signed a pledge not to vote ior me again unless would en- gsgo to vote for a repeal of the Income-tax.

			TIlE POLITICAL Ecoxossy AND TEN-Dgxcy OF STRnTsS-Mr. H. Fawcett, Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cam- bridge, delivered an address upon this subject, last evening, in St. iMartin'sihail, to an audience composed for the most part of members of the working classes. Ho was introduced to the meeting by Sir J. Kaye Shuttloworth, who presided on the occasion, and having in a few prelimi- nary remarks disclaimed being theadvocateof any particular party in the disputes between capital and labour which had arisen, observed that he had been encouraged to lay before the public his views on the important question with which he was about to deal, ;by the fact that they had been deemed by so. high an authority as Mr. 3. Stewart 1I11 not unworthy of consideration. Pro- ceeding then to the development of those views, ha expresasd his dissent from the opinion that strikes ought
			tobe regarded as producing effects entirely bad, and his belief that their tendency was to bring about social rela- tions between the employer and the employed very different from those which at the present day existed. The terms " capital" and " wages" he briefly explained, remarking that It was impossible to ralse the general ave- rage rate of the satter throughout the country unless the former were increased, or the number of those competing for employment was by emigrationorsome other means diminished. Touchiing then upon the questlon whe- ther the number of hours which the recipients of wages should work were simply regulated by custom, or the will of the capitalist, or by laws which couid not be arbitraril
			set aside, he stated it to be his opinion that, although ft might be quite possible for a number of labourers entering into a sudden combination to procure for a short period the same amount of wages for nine hoers' work as they bad previously done for ten, yet, inasmnuch as the accumulated fund from which the remuneration for their labour was drawn would in consequence be diminished, they must not hope to succeed in obtaining permanently the same amount of wages for less wvork. One manifest tendency of strikes, be then went on to say, was to bring the rates of wages In different employnsents to one common level, while they alao tended to procure for the labourer a share of that extra profit which the capitalist happened to derive from the improvement of his trade. Bae
			while a strike might with advantage be had recourse to at a time when from that or other cauosethe profits of the capi- talist had increased, it isas, he conitended, an ill-advised proceeding to adopt when trade was depressed, and when both the employer and the employed were suffering from that circumstance. The question, therefore, as to which party was in the right In the recent dispute which had taken place in the metropolis, between the masters and their men, he regarded as depending for its solu- tion upon the answer which could be returned upon those points. Adverting to the asstrtien so frequently made that strikes never produced any good to the labonrer, he denied iti justice, and, passing over several instances in which, he said, the very objects for which strikces had been entered into had been secured, maintained that even In the case of the Preston strike, which had indicted on the working classes a loss of 250,000., labour had not combined in vain, inasmuch as the masters had upon that occasionx been made aware of the strength xwhich union conferred upon those whom they employed, and would be induced In fature, by making the workman a participator in his increased profits, to avoid the repetition of a similar movement. Capital and labour were no doubt opposed to one another as things at present stood, but identity of interest between them might, ho tougt, t efecte bymakig te lbourer a partici- patoc in the improvement in his master's trade-a re-
			tenldted to bring about.Thletrrhnpocddt,
			culatedtoconfer on the laboering clsses, andth benefit which giving them increased interestin th
			ployer's sucess oby the means which he had indicated would be likely to produce. Re, in conclusion,epesdahe that the teachings of experience would net be lost on the working man, for

			WILEY V. CILAWFOPBD AN'D ANOTHF.R.
			Mr. Brett was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Manisty, Q.C., and Mr. Jones for the defendant.

			The plaintiff, in April last year, was owner andl captain of the brigantine Pacific. Oa Thursday, the Ist of that month, the vessel was in the port of Shields with a full cargo on hoard and ready for sea. On that day ho met a Mfr. Ingle. dew in the stret inNorth Shields. Mr. Ingledew immediately began a dispute with him concerning another vessel called the IsabelLa, formerly belonging to the plaintiff, hut which had
			been lost. Ingledew claimed to be a mortgagee of that vesel,andwihedtheplantff o gveup some papers to enabie him (Ingledew) tPo obttafin thgeiinsrenc. At Ingle- dew's request the platif accompanied him to the office of the defendants, who are solicitors in North Shields, and after sonic iscussion the latter asked the plaintiff to deposit the ship's register with them tiU the following Mon day, which, as the wind was not then favourable for the sailing of the Pacifi6c the plaintiff consented to do. On the Saturday, the wind having become fair, the plaintiff req,uestedthedefendants togivoup the register. Theyrefused, and in consequence the vessel was prevented from sailing. On the Monday the register was given up; but the wind having again become contrary the vessel could not sail. On tbe Wednesday the plaintiff was arrested by the mortgagees of the Isabella and remained in prison for several months. It, of course, beeame necessary that another master should bo procured for the Pacific which was ultimately done, and she salled on the 10tho?April, having been detained elght days from the tlme when the register was demanded by the plaintiff The expenses of the vessel were estimated at 41. a-day, and the amount clalmed by the plaintiff was 321.
			For the defence it was submitted that the section of the Act of Parliament was to preventeaptains from pledging ships' registers, and did not apply to the case of the owner him- self of a vessel depositing her register and consenting to her not saUing for a specified time.
			The learned JUDGE reserved this point for the opinion of canted to the deposit of the register till the Mondday whenIt for 321.-Verdict accordingly.

			BATES V. M'-IM'Ry.
			oAr. NYliae, LJ.V., and Alr. quatn were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. James, Q.C., and lfr. Baylis for the de- fendant.
			The declaration was work and labour, to which the de- fendant pleaded never indebted and payment.
			In this action, which excited considerable interest, the plaintiff, who was formerly in Inspector of Police in Liver- pool, is a detective, and his business is principaUy to discover and arrest absconding debtors at home and abroad. His terms are to he paid one gainea a-day while engaged in this country, two guineas a-day while absent abroad, together in both cases with traveUing and other expenses, and also, as he contended, 5 per cent. commission on the amount ultimately obtained for the creditor who employed him. On the 29th of Jnme, 1858, he was sent for to the office of Mr. Holden, eolicitor at Liverpool, where he found the de- fendant. Mr. Holden and the defendant then instructed the plaintiff to proceed to Sonthampton with a writ and warrant to arrest for a debt of upwards of 15,0001. duo to the defend- ant a Mr.Montgomery, of NewOrleans,whowasapassenger in the American steamship bound for Havre, and about to touch at Southampton for the purpose of landing passengers. Anindemnity for so doing, and instractions how to proceed, were given to the plaintiffin writing. Plaintiff accordingly proceeded to Southampton, but did not succeed in arresting MIr. Montgomery, as he wvas not among the passengers lauded from thcsteamship by the smaU steamer. Plaintiff then went to London, and afterwards, by defendant's desire, to Paris, when, in company with a French detective officer, he in vain searched the hotels for M1r. Mont- gomery. Plaintiff then went to Havre, when he ascer- tained that Mr. Montgomery had actually landed there from thce steamship and gone to Paris. Plaintiff re- turned to Paris, and, through a cabman at the railway station, ascertained that Mr. Montgomery had gone to an hotel and was then residing there under a feigned name. By this time the dcfendant himself had arrlved in Paris, and through the exertions of the plaintiff,assisted by a French attorneyand the French police, Mr. Mtontgomery was ul- timately arrested, together with his wife. By this pressure 3001. in cash and three endorsed bills for 1,0001. each at six and 12 months and two years' date respectively were ex- tracted from Mr. Montgomery. The first two bills were duly paid when due, the last was still running. During the progress of the business the dcEfendant had paid the plaintiff a sum for disbursements and his charges at two guineas a-day, but disputed his right to commission. A sum of 501. had, however, been Faid to the plaintiff's clerk, Mfr. Allen, which the latter stated was only received on ac- count, and not in ful settlement, as was contended by the defendant.
			After a short summingup by the learned Judge, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 1251., the fuU balance claimed.
			The special jury causes being now concluded, Mr. Justice Blackburn proceeded with common juries.

			_- - - WVILLIAbIS V. BRONV.
			(03cf&amp;?e Mir. J?WiCe HILL.)
			Mrx. teorrc TXemple appeared for the plalntWff and Mr. IAttler for the defendant.
			The action was brought for the false imprisonment by the defenldant, who was the master of a ship, of the plaintiff, who was aseaman on beard. The plaintiff had shipped from England for Bombay and back,and when at Bombay refusedI to return to the ship, for which offence he wvas sentenced to four weeks' Imprisonment, at the close of which he was again requested to return, hut again refused, whereupen Ilie was again imprissned fur 12 weeks, or until the ship sailed. When she sailed he was put on board, end t-hen refesed to workc, alleging illness. The defendant sent for a doctor, whoesaid that the plaintiff could work after seven or eight days. According to the plaintiff's story he was at the end of four days imiprisoned in a place 0 feet by 5 wilth- out any reason being assigned, was only let out for one hour in 48, and hadl a great part of the voyage only half-a-pound of bread and two quarts of water, and for the rest the same, with the addition of half-a-pint of soup and ball-a-pint of coffee. On liis arrival in IAverpool the captain gave him Into custody, hut did not appear against him. While in Bridewell he was so ill that the keep~er sent for a surgeon, and he was the samne day removedi to the 'Northern Hospital
			where he remained 10 days, and was so ill from scurvy, rheumatism, and palpitation of the heart, that ho could not go to sea for five mnouths.
			Mr. LITTLER, for the defendant, urgedl the difficulties of masters of ships in enforcing order and obedlence, and the severity wvith which they wore punished for ill-using seamen. He called witnesses to prove that the mani had refused to work, andi was daily asked whether he would tern to, hut always refused; that he was never confined till the ex- piration of eight days, when the captain, from his previous conduct, believed he was skulk-ing, and that a summons takn ot b hi aalut te dfedan fo waeshad been disissd b th maistate, ad h ased,eve ifthe pun- ishmnt ero xcesiv, tht te jry aa. ld ivnominal
			Mr.Jusicefin tld he urytha tis was a case of
			tat the plantff hiad refused to work,I andta,teeoe he was justified in what he hadl done. If h litf a refesed, and the punishment was not excessvndge,i
			was of a kind that ought rather to be encouraged tan discouraged. Did the plaintiff refuse to work withouit lawful excuse? If not, the verdict must be for the plaintiff; as also if the punishiment were excessive.
			The jury founda verdict for the plaiiitiff.-Damnagee 20s.
			The last two causes are now being tried, and the assizes are expected to ternainate this evening.

			This was an action to recover the price of a quantity of stone sold andl delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant.
			It appeared that the stone had been ordered of the plain- ff by the dlefendant for the town commissioners and other public bodies in Bideford; and the substantial question between the parties was, whether the defendant had or- dered it en his own account, or had taken the order on com- mission for the plaintiff, as he had done some previous orders, in resPect of whichi, in the present action, he had pleaded a set-off, as well as denied his liability.
			After a long trial, the joxy found a verdict for the plain. tiff for 34L.
			The learned judge then proceeded to try two citycauses.

			SHORT MEASURE IN BEER.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Slr,-I am glad to see tbat Government are about to con- sider the best steps for counteracting the scandalous system of false measures. There seems to be a great anomaly in the law in this respect. When I have in my coals the mer- chant is compelled to deliver a tieket, and to satisfy me that he dellvers feu weight; but when I have In my weekly nine-gallon cask of table ale, the brewer, as I find, regularly and systematically cheats me. The fact having been acci- dentally brought to my notice, I measured two or three (secaled) nine-gallon casks, and found they would not hold above eight gallons. On remenstrattng with the brewer, be candidly owned that the coopers always make these small cask-s short measure, and in fact that private families never are served with the full measure they pay
			If a 2-cwt. sack of coals must by law weigh 2241b., why must not a nine-gallon cAsk by law hold nine gallons?
			Yours resuectfnllv.

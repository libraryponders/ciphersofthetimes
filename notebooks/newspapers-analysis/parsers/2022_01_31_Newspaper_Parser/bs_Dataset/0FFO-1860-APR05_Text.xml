			Tbhi Hopiteal has been open upward, of a century for the reception ot ernItent protittcee. and of other Young women wbo, having been reduced,wouldhavetallen Into deeper vioe but for Ito protection. Morethsn two-thirds of it inmates amounting to6.159, h3ve be*nre- stored to virtue, and under the Divine blesoiug persee ered in a rIghi course, and beoome D9eJuD and happy members of society.
			It is now more efficiemt and satsfofctory thtan at any former period, inmamuch as at tho Centenary a fend was ralad for the erection of an additionalward, which ha, u uebeen built, and, with theprohatlonar7 out-ward, has enabled the Inatltutlon to accommodate 180 penItenta, The Inmates ase clothed and wholly provided for doing tbeir re31- deuce at the Hoepital; but ,tz prent fanda owing greatly to the desth of Its old anmmal supporters, are utterly inadequate to malntain more than a emall portion of the number who can be received. The Com- mittee therefore appeal stoongly and oonfidetlyto the publio for aid, so that no penitent be rajectod for want of mcanii to malht*il tih Asylum in full operamtn.
			A reident ebaplain, an efficent matron, and snubm3trom devote tnemselve3 wlth the utmoe. gentleneum and conaideratlon to the aspiritual, moran, and Jndostrions training of the inmafe ; and hardly a wee: pre without the arrIval o1 a letter to some of the ofiuers ot the eaablihenocat, dwellng in grateful terms upon the bles(ng o0 having been reclaimed t-mzsh theIr kind attentions.

			THBE UBDER AT STAUFORD.
			Additional evidence of an important cbarsoter was taken yesterday in the case of Henry Corby, charged with the murder of Elizabeth PoUey, under the borrible circum- stances already described in 24c Timer. The inquiry was resumed before the Mayor (Ur. NV. Langley) and other magistrates at the Town-hal, which wascrowded throughout the proceedings. Ho ii s n
			Mr. lb. W. George, managing clerk to Mr. Hopkinson solicitor to the deceased lady, was the first witness ex- amined. He deposed as foUows :-I knewthe deceased, Eli- zabeth PLUey. On Mlonday morning,the 19thoMrrach,incon- sequenco of information received, Iproceeded tothehouse of the deceased in company with SergeantHarrison and Con- stableDalrymple. .ventto thefront door,andfounditlocked. There wasneither inoolcer nor bell; the beo had beentaken off for some time. I then went round to the back, and saw tho house-door open. The door of the garden, opening into a back street., appeared to be secured inside. The polce officers got over the garden waU from an adjoining premises, and let me In. I and Harrison went down the garden together, and found the back door open as well as the, ecuUery-door. Each of thesa doors opens into a smaU coortyard between the garden and the house. On entering the kitchen, which adjoins the senllery, I saw the body of Miss PaUey lying on the hearthstone in front of the fire-place. The deceased appeared to be foUy dressed. A small bonnet lay against the head, and by her left side, between the body and the fireplace, wias an upright brass candlcstick, which seemed to have fallen from her hand. The clothes were partly burnt off, end the body also was much injured by fire. The fire appeared to have gone across the body and scorc hed the face. 1Materiais for a fire werea rranged in the grate, but they were nnlUghted. On a table in the centre of the room were somne loaves of bread, and on the chimney-plece was a wine bottle, which, I have since ascertained, had contained sherry. A fender stood against the wal-not at the freplace. The staircase Immediately adjoins the kitchen door. On the stairs I dis- covered a piece of candle about an inch long. In the break- fast-room, opposite to the kitchen, there was on the table a bottle containing sherry, with a wine-glass, which had been used, by the side of it. About three glasses of wine had been taken from the bottle. I found three bunches of keys lying about, but I cannot be suro whether they were all on the table of the break-fast-room or part in the other room. There are four bed-rooms on the first floor, and two attics, which are at the front of the house. In the north- east bed-room were four sets of drawers and some boxes; some of the drawers were locked and otbers unlocked. They contained various letters and papers which appeared to havo been disturbed and turned over, and left tn a very loose way. I did not then observe that any violence had been nsed to open the drawers. I next went into the south-east bed- room, andifound it in an unfurnisbedstate, with several boxes in it. In one of the boxes which was unlocked I found o quantity of title deeds. On entering the affics I did not observe anything particular, hut the rooms looked in some confosion, Miss Bailey had not kept a servant for several months. The south-west bad-room, over the kitchen, ap- peared aS if it had net been need for a consderable time. I then went into the south-east room, which was pointed out to me as Miss PFUey's bed-room. There were two beds in this room; one, a four-post bed, appeared to have been slept in, and not made afterwards. Therewere no sheets on the bed, but the blankets seemed to have been slept in. By the side of this bed were a Bible, two Prayer-books, and a hymn-book. There are twro rooms In the front of the house on the ground-floor. One of these, the dining rom,is in an unfurnishedstat; the otherwas furnshed, and oocfpied as a sitting-room. Having looked al throagh the rooms, I locked up the house and took charge of the keys. At that tIme I came to the conclislon that Miss PnUey had accidently set herself on fire, and been burnt to death. In the afternoon of the same day I again went through tbe honse with a relative of the deceased. On the 30th of Decamber last I had given deceased a check on the bank of Messrs. Peacock and Co. for 11G7. lOs. id. I had reason to believe also that she had another check for upwrds of 500?. We searched for a wrill, but found none, but we found the cheek for 500OL, of whlch I took possession. Kinowing Miss Bnlley's eccentric habits, I did not in the first instance suspect that there had been any robbery, although I found some of the contents of the drawers in confusion. I attributed the disordered condition of the draw/ers to the eccentric habits of the deceased. An inquest was bald on the evening of the same day, and I went with the coroner and jory to view the body. The room was very offensive from the burninv. On
			leavlng the house I gave the body into the charge of Mrs. WaUace and Mrs. lAttle, with strict injunotions to search for the deceased's pocket and a rLng whteh I knew Miss PaUey was accustomued to wear. After attending to give may evidence at the inquest I returned to tho house, and in answer to my inquiry was told by MIrs. Wallace that neither the poc'ket nor the ring had been foumd. My suspicions were then aroused, and I came to the conclusion that a rob- bery had been committed. On the Tnesday (the day after -he discovery of the body) I gave some direcftons for the ashes under and surronuding the body to be examined; they were sifted in my presence, but tho rinz was not found. The hence was then closed until the 2th, w.hen I made a further examination of the ashes. I then found the pieces of cord produced, which appear to have heen burnt. Were was a smaU quantity of human hair among the eiftings of the ashes, aud adhering to the hair was what I then thought to be piece of bone. I have slnce ascertained that what I tGok to he a piece of hone was a teeth. There was a round hole burnt through the kitchen floor near the hearth-stone, over which the body lay. The ground underneath was examined to see if the missing ring had falen through the hole. There were ashes and portions of the deceased's dress below the floor, and I also discovered what appeared to be a fragment of a finger- bone, but the ring was nob there. On the 27th the house was thoroughly searched, and every box examined, but we were unable to find any plate, with the exception of a salt- spoon, mustard-spoon, and a pair of sugar-bows, which were marked vw ith initials, and one or two other small articles. (The articles named were produced.) The only money found in the house consisted of a sixpence wrappad up in a voucher, a penn, a half-penny, and three farthings. In one of tne drawers upstairs I found a portion of a. writing-deash, whIch I delivered to Mr. Superlntendent Ward. To one drawer of another set violence had been used, but the lock had not

			Gieorge Jabez Munton examined. I am a cabinetmaker, residing in this town, and am 20 years of age. On Monday, tho 19th of March, I went to the prisoner's shop to work. The shop Is at tbe back of his house, in St. Martin's. In the afternoon of the day named I saw a rosewood box, with brass binding, on a shelf in the workshop, to which shelf I had occasion to go for a plane. The shelf was on the side of the shop, high up near the tiles of the roof. I could not reach It without a stool. The box was about 14 inches long, 10 inches wide, and about5A inchesdeep. Itook up the box and tried to raise the lid, butit ppesared to belocked. andIdid not then open it. I was at work in the same shop the next day. Robert Marslh was there also. About 10 o'clock in the morning I saw March standing on a stool at the shelf before named. The prisoner was not preent. March took up the box which I had previously seen on the shelf, brought it down, and placed it on a bench at which wa were worklng. The box was opened by March in my presence; it was un- looked, and something was heard to chink inside. The box turned out to bo a writing-desk, lined with blue leather. There were no ink-glasses in the desk, but there were holes for them. A penholder lay in a parti- tion between the two holes for the inkstands. March lifted up the lid of the lower part of the desk, and I then saw six gold rings, one gold coin about twice the size of a sovereign, a silver coin larger than a shiUing, three or four smaller silver coins, a gold coin about the size of a half-sovereign, and a silver thimble. Two of the rings were broad half- mourning rings; on one of them was an inscription, "Thomas Palley" and below that name was "Eliza- bath Pulley." ihe other ring was inscribed inside, "Mary Chamberlain." A third ring was much nar- rower than the two iirst described, and thls had no inscription on it; a fourth was set with small white beads; the other two were plain wedding-rings, and each had an Inscription on it-one, "P ule you," and other words which I cannot remember. I cannob say what was the inscription on the other. There was also what appeared to be the silver top of an inkstand. I examined these arti- cles three or four times, and then March closed the box, and replaced It on the shelf, with aU the things in it. On tho same shelf I also noticed two chim- ney ornaments-a pair of bellU-haped china vases, blue and gold,-but I did nob take them down. Both the desk and the Omaments could be seen on the shelf from the floor of the shop. After we had examined the desk, but the same afternoon, the prisoner got up to the shelf and gave me two planes off It. About half-past 2 I saw the prisoner take down the ornaments and place them on a bench at the end of the shop. He sad "These ought to have gone home; tbheve no bnsiness there." Ee went away and left them on the bench. Prisoner then appeared to be in- toxicated. The ornaments were on the bench when I left the shop that evening, but when I went to work on the following morning they were gone. I had never seen the desk or the ornaments on the shelf before the Monday rorning. The box was brass-bound, but I did not notice whether there was an inscription plate on the lid. On the Tuesday, when I got home, I mentioned to my mother what I had seen.
			Police-constable Dalrymple sald,-Since the prisoner has been in custody I have been employed to search his house and premises. On the 21th of March, in a fireplace in the prisoner's workshop,wheretherohadbeenafireon theprevious day,Ifound the four pieces of brass now produced. I con. tinned the search on Monday, the 26th, and sifted the ashes in the grate; and I then found a lock, an escocheon, some screws, hinges, and other pieces of brass (produced). On further searching the workshop I found in a box (produced) some more ornamental brasswork, coiled up. (The whole of the nieces of brass corresponded, end appeared to have been the binding of a wriffng-desk.)
			The wit;ess Munton was recaled, and said -The lock on the desk was similar to that now produced by Policeman Dalrymple. The deck was inlad 'with brass, simiflar to that produced. I cannot say whether It was of the exact pattern, but it seemed to correspondl, and was about the same length. The joints and otherportions produced appe-ar to bethe same noticed oaths deskIn the prisoner'sworkshop.
			The prisoner declined to put any question to either Msunton or Dalryniple.
			Robert March examined.-On Tuesday morning, the 20th of March, I went to wrork at tepioe' hp h
			prisoner vrasthere,butaftervinnmme instructions as to what I was bo do he went away. Witness here deposed to the find- ing and examination of the writing-desk, as already narratedi by M1unton. To the list of articles enumerated by Munton March added that hea aw in the desk a seal, n Unsed stamped envelope, a smell piece of brass, and some wafers. The small gold coin mentioned wltness notlced was of tho reign of George I1L, and dated 1806. Masrch also confirmed
			Mun.on's evidence as to t!b Inscriptions on the mourning rings. The witness added that hso had the articles in his
			hands abont a quarter of anl hour, and examined them the-I roughly. He likewIse observed the vases spoken oF, and pw?,l thme prisnez remcve them from the shelE ar dplace them
			ona-vice-benh,whereCorbyletthem untIlthe nextmorning, whenhc (prisoner)tookthemaway. Witness thencontinued: -About 9 o'clozk on the Wednesday morning, I sawtho pri. soner tako the desk down into his hoase. He covered it over with hls apron. He was not in the shop wlen I leEk work at hall-past 5 th_t evening. On the Thursday I was still at work for Corby. About half-past S in the afternoon the prisoner's wiEe sent me to the Coach and Horses Iin
			about somo work, When I hod been there about a qgarter of an hour the prisoner camo to me in a beiroom where I wes at work, and said, "I want to see you- you'll be done just now?' I said, "Yes." I finishcd the job, and then went downstairs to have a glas5 of ale. While I was stiU there pr'soner came to n-a again and asked ifI had done, end I said "Yes." He went across the street and into his house by the front door, anc I entered the workshop by the back way. When I got into the shop prisoner was there. He said, " I suppose you've seen in a desk some ringe with Miss Pnlley's name?" I re. pi3ed that I had. lIe said, " It's false; there's no such name; it's something Eike it." Prisoner then said ha would go end fetch the things, and left the shop. In about a quarter of an hour he returned, and
			said, "It's a wrong name, buk os3mething like it." He did not bring the rings, or show tem to me. Alter. wvards he again s.aid he would go and fetch the rings. He returned in a short time and said, " 1 hope you won't say anything nbout it-the way I was situated some time ego, I --n't knew what might be the consquenc." Two cc three times in the course of the afternoon of the same ay the prisoner repeated his request that I would say nothtng about what I had seen. He appeared very uneasy. I told him I should not stay with him any loner than that night5 but gave him no reason for leaving. Tbe same n1ght I saw the prisoner again at the ited Cow publiehousa Directly I entered he went out without speakangto me. My wages have not been paid. The desk Isawin the prisoner's workshop was about 14 inches in length 10 Inche2 -wide sad sin or eight deep. It was of rosewood, with orns- mental brass let in. The brass produced is of the same pat. tern, end the lock produced is like that I saw on the desk in theprisoner's possession. Th witness also spoke to thE similarity of other fragments which were shown to him.
			Mr. Ward, chtef euperintendens of police, produced that portion oar d- made to contain pens and placed between the inkstands.
			The witness March said tho pen-supporter produced wsa such an one as would fit the desk ho saw in the prlsoner'a workshop, and which desk was then without a pen-supporter. [The pen-supporter in questilon was found by Mr. George in the decease 's house.]
			Mr. Superintendent Ward deposed, in addition, that hs received from Mr. George a bunch of keys found in the house of the deceased, one of which he had tried in the lock discovered by policemun Dilrymple in the firegrate of the prisoner's workshop, and it fitted exactly.
			Susannah Munton (mother of the young man previuely examined) was next called. She said,-On Thursday, the 22d of March, in consequence of what mv son had told me, I went to the prisoner's house, about 2 o'clock in the after- noon. I saw Mrs. Corby, the prisoner's wife. I told her something that my son had said. On the same afternoosn the prisoner came to me at my house in Blackfrlars-street. HIe ssked me if my son was at home, sd I said he was not. Prisoner then said, "WVhat about theae boys andh the wvriting-desk and rings?" I said, "My son told me he za
			half a dozen rinrs with tho name of Pulley on them- Thomas Pulley, Elisiabetl Pulley, sand Masry Chamberlain." The prisoner said, " No sn_h thing ;" it was not the name
			Pulley, hut something similar to it. He added, "TZhe box: is gone to the parties it belongs to." This he repeated tn-o or three times. I don't think he aald anything more, et- cept that he had never looked in the box himself. I ha
			noticed that my Don was very uncomfortable before La made tho communication to which I have alluded.
			Sarah Ann Ireland, aged 19, deposed.-I lived in the service of Miss Pulley very nearly six years. I left her service about five years ago. While living with her }: frequently saw plate in her possession. I had noticed two tall and two flat caudlesticks, one dozen large and ona dozen small spoons, a teapot and coffeepot, a cream-jug, dessert knives and forks, a dozen teaspoons, two sdtspoons,' two salteeUars lined with gold, &amp;c. These artilesG were; solid sliver ; deceased used to set them out and show them. to me. She sald she could set up a jeweller's shop. She. rhad sin rlngs, whlch she kept in a silvor snuffbox. Them' were four keepers and two wedding rings. One oi the rings, a half-mourning one, deceased 3lwavs wore on the forefinger. This ring was inscribed, "In remembrance of me." One wedding ring had insido it "Forget me not." I don't think the other had any insurlp.. tion. One of the keepers was inscribed " M. Chamberlain." A mounnmg ring had "Thomas Pulley" on It. I don't; know where the deceased was in the habit of keeping her money. Her drawers and cupboards she generally kept looked. She kept her keys in a basket, in a side cupboard in the parlour. 'When she went out she always canried the keys with her. The deceased had two writing desks-a smaU one, and s large one; the latter was ornamented with brass. There were a dozen teaspoons, marked " M. C. -' the rest of the plate was marked " E. P.," except the dessert knives and forks, which were not marked. Miss PuUey always carried a good deal of money-about her.
			The prisoner was then again remanded until the 12th inst;

			I DB2IDAM-DBINKING I27 PRUSSIA.
			TO THE EDITORC OF TIIE TIHES.
			Sir,-Startling as Mr. Hardy's statistics wero on Monday night, respecting the amoant of drunhenness in France and Swedon, it is, of conrse, impossible to donbt their accurAcy, supported as they are by such high authorities as thoso cele- brated novelists, Cooper and Alison.
			I trust, however, that Mr. Hardy wiU not consider me impertinent if I inquire what celebrated noveHlt has fur4, rilsbed him with the fast that " out of 174 young men examined for the Prcs3ian army in 1SSS 170 wore In. capacitated by dram-drinking for tho military service."
			Great allowances ought unadobtedly to bo mado for the heat of debate and the fer of constituent publicaus, but still I do think this Prusaian story is one on which even a celebrated novelist would hardly venture.
			If, however, it is to be found in some work of fiction, and if Mr. Fardy, on that account, claims that the Brltish publia- should believe it, I can only say that it appears to me tak furnish an excelent reason why, by encouraging wine-shop3, we shonid discourage gin-drinking.
			I I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

			By the present Australian mail the following gold- ships are annotnced to have left Melbourne for England:-Greyhound, Jan. 17th, with 20,0001.; 26onarch, Norwood, and Ocean Chief, 24th, with 280,000'.; Montmorency, 28th, 36,0001.; and the
			ghtsliniug and Lincolnahire, Feb. 8th, with 180,0Ui!.; making a total, including the Copen- hagen and Siffolk, advised by the last mail, of sbout 800,0001.
			The India telegram to-day, regarding the papes currency to be introduced, states that " the issue will be effected through commissioners of the Bank of England." Thisis doubtless amistake. Accord- ing to the official correspondence on the subject, the details of which have been fully given in Thwe Times, the issue will be managed by commissioners specially appointed in Tndia. The Master of the Calcutta 3Aint will be one, and the others will also be public functionaries. The Bank of England are simply to Eupply the notes.
			tiome correspondence presented to Parliament on the state of affairs in Japan brings t'ce information from that quarter down to the 7th of January last. it Is not enconraging with regard to the prospects of trade. The Government, it is said, keep up all the pntward appearances of a desiro to give execution to the treaties, while their acts leave no doubt what- ever of a hostile atimsts. On the other hand, the disposition of the people in general remains most =micable. They are so fettered, however, by muni- cipal and other regulations of a severe character that it is almost imnes3ible to establish communica- tion with them. No respectable persons of educa- tion are allowed to hold intercourse with fo- reigners unless spedially employed by the Go- vernment for that purposo. In Jeddo the diplomatic representatives themselves are liable to insult from officers of the State; in Kanagawa foreigners are murdered, and in Hakodadi and lfagasaki their houses are broken into, and the property of the merchaubs, even in shipment and landing, is daringly pilfered, the authorities taling no measures either for prevention or punishment. Incendiary fires also aro of constant occurrence, rind in the last instance 5o,0001. of British and American property was consumed or plundered, the police present bein- themselves engaged in stealing, "With a perpetual menace of assassination on the one hand, and incendiarism on the other, while earthrquakes almost every week shako the houses to their foutndations," the post of diplomatic agent at Jeddo is described to be a serious trial even lor those of the most bold and sanguine tempera- mnent. The und - rstanding that a powerful European expedition is ;bh.nt to visit China to compel good laith in that quarter is believed to have produced some effect in exeiting the fears of the Government - but if this expedition is not vigorously conducted !.he result in Japan will, of course, be to increase the determination to get rid of us. Mr. IRuther- ford Alcock, the British Consul-General, seems Irom the first to have pursued a courae of ;reat, but not undignIfied forbearance, and oc- 'asionally to have produced by this means a disposition to good conduct on the part of the officials. All such manifestations, howevor, are temporary, and on a recent occasion, in laying be- fore the Government a recapitulation of their mis- 'deeds and disregard of the treaty stipulations, he wvas led to hint that force might ultimately have to iie employed. The home Government, while ap proving his general proceedings, dissented from this. In a despatch, dated the 2Sth of February
			,ast, Lorrd John Russell regretted that any threat of .war had been resorted to, his reasons being that if Uhe grievances are not redressed and war is not '3Rade, the character of the British Government is in pome degree impaired, while, on the other hand, if war is made to enforce the observance of a commer- ,%ial treaty, we run the risk of engaging in protracted "Lbstilities " and of earning a reputation for quarrel- Nhig with every nation in the East." Whether it is 'iise either to enter into treaties, if we mean to an- nounce afterwards that we may be cheated with impunity, or to regulate our actions not by the dis- tinct merits of a question, but by the fear of being balled quarrelsome, are points which may admit of Siscussion. On the whole, however, there is reason 'to hope, with his lordship, that " time and patience inay remove many of the evils now complained of," and to admit that " the Japanese, on their side, miay 'ieU be jealous of Europeans who insult their usages hnd carry away their gold."
			Subjoined are the political and mercantile details from Montevideo by the present maLl. They embrace -a satisfactory report of the prospects of the Protest- ant Italian settlement on the Rosario.-
			"' This day has been elected President of the Republic for the next four wears Don Bernado Berro, whoso best recom- nendation is his respectablo and honourable private charac- ter. Time will &amp;how whether his public or political cba- racter will barmonize with it. His enemies say that he is destitute of energy and firmness-. Tp to within these i-st few days it was doubtful whether Diego Lmas, Acevedo, or B3erro would be elected, as It was k-nown or be- L'eved that each could count upon about an equal number of votes. In order to exclude a military man, and the known friend and nomnin-e of lUrqulza, who Is believed desirous of lnvolriuf the liver Plato Republics in a war with 9razll, the supporters of Acevedo co3lesced with those oif Berro, and agreed to clec' the latter, who thus obtained an overwhelming majority. The retirln" Pro- eldent, Don Gabriel Pereira, was elected first magmstrate on the 1st of Marchi, 1,56, and his foer years of adminis- tration have beer. on the wbole not unfortunate for the republic. He has satisfactorily arranged the settlement of ninny heavy debts on terms advantageous to the State, and established a credit which it had not enjoyed for a long peried of years- With one exception, the internal peace of the republic bas not been disturbed; but the manner in which that excoption terminated will always remin a stain en his character. But, even in that affalr-I allude to the Quinteros maez.scre-many people bellev o wLas mndivi. dually blameless. The Chambers wrer opened for tho ses. slon on the 15th ult., but no business of importance has been transacted. According to the officlal statement of the Finance Minister, the Government has verified the forgery of upwards of 27,000,000 of bonos, some particulars of w;hich I gave you eeveral months ago. The amount of bones presented for conversion into the New Six per Cent. Stock exceeds 00,000,0(), but, as the coupons have not been received from Europe, the new stock is not yet Issued. It Is said the endlture of the last year exceeds the income by about Sil,000,00, or, rather, the Government }as not been able to meet its current expenses in conse-. euco of a defioiency to that amornt. Tdistever, ofit sIvways bo the taso untha a mouo honet inlstrathon of thw �mmds and a ritd economy of the resources of the State are
			oe generally practised. I observe in the columns of V'ke ~2'ines a list of ~subscriptioas to a fund for the erection of r Protestant church for the Vaudois, at the settlement en the Rosario, in this Republic, The fe Englh aud other Proteat.nts hero are about to contribute theLr mite for the pamo object. Teii settlement, I am informed, is pro-
			pressing favomrably, and the pasteur, who was to leave Europe In January, is expected with anxiety. The Vaudois are a simple and industrious people, and deserve every encouragement and support. Tie country, except within a lumited space around the city, has beenblessedwithaabundanceofrain. The cattle are fat, and, no doubt, during the next two or threo months a con- siderable number will be slaughtered. In Montevldeo we are distressed for want of wvater. Land continues to ad- vance in value, and no doubt, if Berro's administration be as peaceful as that of Pereira, within four years the price will approach that paid in the British colonies. Labour is much required, particularly herds for sheep. Englishmen and Germans continue to purchase farms for rearing sheep and in. soOme places for many leagues they are the principal
			Excbaage,4lid. to 42}d. Discounts, 1 per cent. per month. with regard to Buenos Ayres, the following ex- tract seems to show that her forced incorporation with the Argentine Confederation will continue only until she gains sufficient strength to make n new attempt for independence *-
			" Buenos Ayres continues quietly to develops its resources by extending its railsays and adopting other measures add- ing to ibs strength and importance. The convention!of No- vember will not ha literallg carrled out, and there are indi- cation3 that matters will remain pretty much as they were for the next three years Peace, however, maybe maintained if the Argentine Confederation act with prudence and cir- cumspection. Dr. Derqui has been elected president of the IConiederaton, and General Urqiza named commander-in- I chief of its force. Derqui is believed to be no friend of the
			Porteflos. There are not a few who believe that Buenos Ayres will ultimately have to declare her independence, and they do not think it would be a disadvantage to her or to the interests of commerce. There are rumours that if Buenos Ayres does not de facto join the Confedera- tton at an early period, the Congress will reimpose the differential duties, and otherwshe annoy and attempt to injure her. The Pareuayan steamer Tacuri, which was detained in the roads of Buenos Ayres by order of Admiral Lusblngten, has been permitted to sail, in consequence, it is believed, of the release of the British subject, Caustant. President Lopez is about to despatch a diplomatic agent to ! Europe to explain the benevolence and justico of his ad- ministration. Exchange in Buenos Ayres, 66s. Gd. to 67e. the doabloon ; and paper dollars, 333 the doubloen."

			STATXB OF TRADE.
			LEICESTER, APRIL 4.-There Is an average amount of busineas doing in 8he hosiery tr ade, and tho fine weather vill increase the darmand for cotton goods. This branch is already more active, and fancy goods will soon be more in- quired after. At Loughborcugh and Hinckley trade is active. Yarns are in fair requiest, and prices remain niuch the same. Spinners continue tolerably employed. Wools are firm, at high prices for superior qualities.
			NOTTING H AM, 4TH.-The lace trade is quiet, and In very few branches is there as much doing as is usual at the pre- sent time of the year. Throughout the sprin there has been very little trade, the cold season havin' dogbtless bad some infiltence in the demand; the weather has now, how- ever, become more genial, and an Improvement may be looked forward to. ln fancies there is rather more doing ; the plain branch Is without alteration. The hosiery trade continues in a satisfaetory condition; many branches are busy, and all good workmen ate well ongaged. At Sutton- ln-=Aabfield and several other country districts the hosiery trade is in a healthy state.

			WEDN-YSAY EVmNaG.
			The railway-market has been steady, and at one period experienced a further improvement. A reac- tion, however, afterwards took place, and the closing prices were about the same as yesterday, a few stocks exceptionally showing a slight advance or decline. Great Northern A is 1 per cent. higher. The general business has been unimportant. At 4 o'clock Mid- land was quoted 117 to i; Lancashire and York- shire, 102i to North-Eastern (Berwick), 93# to 94; North British, 60, to 61 ex div.; South- East,ern, 87 to 88; Great Northern, 1114 to 112; ditto A, 115 to 116; Sheffield, 42&amp; to i; and Eastern Counties, 56 to i. The principal featulre in the colo- nial-market has been a fall in the shares of the Great WVestern of Canada, on the non-deelaration of a dividend at tbe meetingcthismorning. After touch- ing 12k a rally took place to 124 to J, a reduction, compared with yesterday, of nearly 153. Indian guaranteed were firm, East Indian especiaUy, closing 1011 to 102-1. In foreign descriptions Pernambuco, Lombardo-enetian, and Great Luxembourg im- proved. Pernambuco were finally quoted 14 to 1 dis., and San Paulo, to 1 dis. The shares of the Illinois Central and New York Central have de- clined. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Govern- ment Bonds also receded X per cent. The only change of importance in mines was a relapse in St. John del Rey. In joint-stock banks a further rally occurred in Australasia, and in miscellaneous de- scriptions there was a fractional Improvement in Berlin Waterworks. Victoria debentures, new, left off 107 to ?; ex div.; Canada Loan, 1j to i- pm. scrip, and 10O to 4 bonds; Ocean Mlarine Insurance, 3 pm.; Universal, i to ? pm.; London and Provin- cial, j to t pm.; and Bank of Turkey, 14; to 14 dis.

			BAILWAY INTBLLIGBENCB.
			LONDON AND NORTI-WESTERI.
			An extraordinary meeting of this comnany was held yes- terday at the Euston statlon, in complihnc with the stamd- ing orders of thoE House of Lords; the Marquis of Chandos iu the chair.
			Mr. C. E. Stewart, tho secretary, read the notice con- vening tho meeting, which contamied a list of 19 railway Bils.
			The CaAxRoax stated tnat the first four Bills on the list had been introduced into Parliament in accordance with arraneements entered into with the Great Northern and the Ianchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Companies, mnd had been approved at a former meeting. Three of the measures were similar to thoso introduced n the last session of Parliament. The first two Bills had been rejected by Par- liament. The proprietors knew that the Bill for autho- rizing arrangements with the Great Northern and the Man- chester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Companies was passed through the HIouse of Commons, but was rejected by the House of Lords for certain reasons given at the time, aud In tho present session two Bills wero Introduced to meet the objections which had been raised, but the House of Com- mons had not passed them, and DO special reasons had been assigned for their-rejection. The compaay, however, hoped they would nitisnatesy ho successful In this matter. Heo then proposed that Bill No. 3 he approved.
			The Solicitor read the heads of Bill No. 3, toathorize the transfer to the London and North-WesternRaiway Company of parb of the undertaking of the St. lelenb Canal and Railwvay Company, and for the increase of the capital of the St. Helen's Company.
			A formal resolution approving the Bill was carried nanli- mously.
			The CEIArxrA?r said that the next BiU he had to propose for their approval was that which stood No. 4 on the list. The object of the Bill was to enable the London and North- Western to take a lower level on the EdgehiU and Garaton Railway at less cost, to form a junction with the Brunswick Dookls at Liverpool, and to obtain some of the land at Edgo- hill whero additional room was requirod.
			The Solicitor read the heads of the Bill, and tho motion approvinsg it was carrled,
			| Tho nextBill, numbered 3 on the lhst, contaed powers for the London and North-Westerfn Company to agree with the Lancashire and York-shire, the Milldand, nnd the North- EasetnCopanes,tDrofroco o to 150ofthe Normanl- to have accems on certain terms. It contained similar powers in reference to the Lancashire and Yorkshire and Oldham and Guldebridge Companies as to the use of the station at Oldham. A motion approving tho Bil was adopted.
			The CrAnrsAw said ho had now to submit Bills which were promoted by other companies. The object of the f'rst Bill was to place the London and North-Western Incommu- nlcation withWelchpool, without, asvas originally intended, converting a portion of the Shropshire Union Canal into a railway. The lLondon and Nlorth-Western would be caUed
			o5,OOl. towvards the construction of tho
			ortion of the Oswestry and Nowtown line. UJnderthe arrangement the London and North-Western would ho able to obtain access to and use the Welchpool station.
			The Bill No. 6 on the I1st was unanimously approved.
			The next Bill submitted and approved was one promoted by the Nuneaton and Hnackley Company, and contained clauses for malking working arrangements. It contained powers for tho London and Norbh-Western to use the Midland Company's line to Llcester and the station at that place; with power to the Midland Company to uso the line proposed by this Bill to bo constructed botween Nuneaton and Coventry, and to have access to the station at Coventry.
			Tho Bill lo. lion tho list, for makiog a railway from the COanock Mineral Rallway into Cannock Chase; and tho Btil No. 13, for maktng a railway from the Chester and Holyhead Railway near Conway, to 1-anrwst, were sub. nfitted and approved.
			The next Bill submitted and approved was No. IS on tho list, for making a ralw ay from Btuckley to Commah's Qaay, in the coanty of Flinb, and for other purposes.
			The C xuaM&amp;N explained that the BiU was promoted by parties connected with the district, the object being to make a mineral line, and to authorlze the North-Western Com- pany to uss the railway and subscribe 10,0001. if deemed ex- pedient. It wonld be necessary to adjourn the meetlng for tho consideration of the other Bills on the list titl the 3d of May. With respect to one of the deferred Bill, he mentioned that if any gentleman wished to convert his Shropshiro Union shares tnto London and North-Western stock ho wonld greatly facilitate that arrangement by com- municating with M,l?r. Stewart on the subject.
			Thanks having been voted to the chairman, the meeting adjournod till the 3d of Mlay.

			G1TEAT WESTERN OF CANADA:
			noe llalr-yearty meeting of timO company was held yester- day at the London Tavern, Mr. R. Gil in the chair.
			The report, an abstraet of which has appeared In The Times, was taken as read.
			The CnA1rnacA_1, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that when it was before the direotors in proof they received a letter from Mr. Brydges, the managing director stating that he had seen Mr. Galt, the Minister of Finance, and that it had been arranged that the interest on the Go- vernment loan should not be ealled for during three years,
			and as the Board understood it that no interest would be charge i, or that the Minister would forego the interest for tbat :-.IG,d they had stated in their report that a 2 per ca;. divhiend would be declared; bun nowthey had to make an l u;plexsast correction of that paragraph, because they iad since been informed, on the arrival from Canada of Mr. ileynolds, their finatcial director, that such wag not the caG-. but that the Minister w.as willing to allow the interest on the Government loan to stand over for three years as a loan to the company, with a view to help them over the depressian. When they were informed of this it was too late to alter tho report, as it had been issued to the shareholders for some days prior to ro:eiving that Information. They had since received an offiEcl intima- tion fromn tho Government of Canada that the interest would not be called up for three years, and that it could stand over as a loan at 6 per cent. He (the chairman) thought it would not do to pay a dividen&amp; with borrowed money. They had pad off all their floating debt, and there- fore thoy did not want to borrow monoy at 6 per cent. ; so that, instead of paying a dividend as stated in the report, the directors had resolved not to do so. He believed that the honcst course was to pay their debts, and they would therefore recommend the payment o' the Interest on the Government loan and declare no divldend on that occa- sion. The available balance, as shown in the re- port, was 41,3111., but they proposed now to de. duct from it 17,4081., the interest on the Government loan, leaving 23,8131., which the director3 recommended should be carried to tho credit of the next half-year's ac- counts. They would carry forward no interest against the company, and thoy would pay 7,0001. on account of the Desjardins accident. They had charged the half-year with all the expenses, and in fact they hadrather overthan under taxed it. They had arranged wlth their representatives in Canada that they should receive remittances from that country at regular perlods, so as to have money In hand to meet fature interest. They had received two sams on this acco:mrt-oneof 5,0001., and another of 6,0001. The capital ac- countwas now closed, and they had paid only 2,0001. in the pasthalf-year asthebalance upon the Sarrid branch. With regard to the working expenses, it was very fallacious to judge of them by their percentage of the receipts. For in- stance, if the receipts averaged S1 per train mile, and the working expenses were half a dollar, there would be 50 per cent. profit, leaving the other 50 per cent. for working ex- penses ; but, if owing to tho competition of other railways, the receipts should be bronght down to half a dollar, the worklng expenses wonld be 100 per cent., and that had been the case with them, owing to the com- petition of some of the American lines. Ho was glad there was Uk-ely to be a termination to that state of tbings. One of the great companies was now in the hands of a receiver, if that was any' satlsfaction to the other company, who had been parties to the rninons competition which he trusted was now at an end. Their line formed a link in the chain of communication, and a pro ra-o&amp; charge had been agreed to, and if they conld raise the rate a lUttle so as to be romunerative, their working expenses would be about 40 per cent. There was enough of traffic on the line provided they were paid a fair pmeeofor what they carried. They had been carrying goods and passengers for half-prioce sad their expenses had coneequenmtly been comparately high, without any benefithto the company. If they had merel
			an approximation to the -tarif of lines ln England (and some of them very low), they would he able to pay a respec. table dividend to tho aharheoldor. The evl wat , theoy did not get paid for what they carricd. He wished to mentio
			that the directors in 1856, had been limited to an extra-ex- penditure of 400,600f. through the exertions of Mfr. Spececr Helirapath, who mojed a resolution to that effect at the general meeting, and it was carried unanimously. With reference to this matter be had to state that the directors in the four years that had sinco elapsed had excoeded that amount by only 25,0001., which he hoped would be consi- dered =atisfactery. As to the tdle rumours of theLr being unpopular in Canada respecting the Detroit and 31l. wa3kee, ho was in a posiion to contr-adict them flatly. Their pricipal manager had brought 'with him a traffio arra-ngement with the 3flehigan Central for the through traffic which proved Some of those statements to be
			adoption of the report and accounts, he would propose th appointment of a committee of shareholders t
			tne affairs of the company, to collect facts, and to report thereon to a special meeting to be convened for the purpos
			Mr. Hosts seconded the motion for the adopton of th report and for carrying over the balance of 23,8St, to th next account.
			Mr. AbNDLPtsoie moved as an amaendment, that the report bo not received, and that a commaittea of shareholders bo appointad to investigate theo allairs of the company, wiith power to examine all boolm, papers, contracts, &amp;c., and the officers and serv-ants of the company, and to proceed to Canada for that purpose, if necessary, anid to report the result of their investigations to a meeting of shareholders.
			Mr. SHzADE seconded the amendment,
			A long discussion. ensued, in which Mr. BsaAxrceA-uT, 'Mr. CANX~AN-, Mr. Tn0oaSi, Mr. H_p.TrxnGE, M1r. A. BER&amp;TTaE, Mr. S. H ER&amp;ALPAT, sand other sharehcolders tookz Part, In the courso of which it was contended, on the part of the dlrectors, that they only wanted an Impartial com- mittee of shareholders having a large stake in the company; while on the part of those who supported the amendment it -was maintained that an independent committee, not being hostile to the directors, would bo the best to appoint. It was also contended by the chairman that aH sections of the shareholders should he fairly represented on the committee.
			MIr. HEAn, on tho part of the Board explained that they had selected two of the largest shareholders from tho list pro. posed by the London dissentient ehareholders-Mr. Suther- land and Mr. Margotson; two from the Glasgow dissentient shareholders-Mr. Kay and Mr, Workman; and one of the

			COTTON OULTI VA TION IN INDIA.
			The following memorial was presented yesterday to Sir Charles WVood by the Cotton Supply Associa- tion:-
			" That your memorlalists ace of opinion that, look' ing to the extensivo area embraced by British India, and tho enormous extent of works of public utility requirod to place that territory in even a proper Btate, in order that its resources may be fairly developed, it is manifestly im- possible for the Government,by Its own efforts, to effect much in that direction, while it is equal]y clear that the surplus capital and free enterprise of England, If made avaUable, will with rapidity ens ply all those of such works as do not of necessity and exclusively belong to the operations of Government.
			" That, Irrespective of the stupendous benefits which a speedy and exteneivo construction of workss of the natur6 referred to in various parts of India would produce to the cotton trade, and therefore to the general community of this country, it is difficult to overrate the numerous civiliing influences and solid advantages whioh would thereby neces- eerily flow to the native population, and espeally when accompanied by the introductlon there of a large body ot Englssh cdvilengineers and others, of skill and education, such as would he employed by private companies.
			" That itj is therefore a matter of the most vital and pressing importanc to the best interests of both India and England that every possible facility should be offered to thoso who are willing to take upon themselves the onerous taskr of raising capital in this country, and to apply it to purposes so pre-eminently important as those before ad. verted to, while, by the adoption of a liberal policy in such cases, the Government wiUi not only relieve Itself of mnuck anxiety and trouble, but be a considerable financial gainer, and at the same time secure the Lffection and loyalty of its subjects.
			" That your memoriallsts have learnt with much satisfac- tion that an influential joint-stork company, established in London under the name of the Madras Irrigation andOsCans
			Company, have submitted to you a proposal to construct extensive works of irrigation, drainage, and navigation in Orisss, and t.o connect that territory wiwth the port of Cal- cutta, requirlng from Government no other assistance than the mere supply of all land requisite for such works. Your memorislists are assured that a company already and favour. ably known to the English public must necessarily possoes advantages for raising capital which could nbt appertain to a newly-organised association, and are therefore more likely: to achlove that success which is all-important in a pioneer enterprise intended to open up the way for a mora general and greatly extended application of the fresskill, science, and capital of Britain to the regeneration of India.
			"YTour mcmorialists therefore most respectfully pray,
			"L That the Right HoB. Her majeatyb Secretary of State for India in Council wil afford to the subjct-matter of this memorial immediate and serious consideration, with a view to the adoption of prompt and energetic measures for the most complete and rapid provision of works of irriation and means of cheap transit in India, thent whereofat
			_ryesent prevents that country from producegn an nlilmited supply of cotton to the manufacturers of Great Britsin. and from relieving the latter from an uncertain and perilous dependence upon the slave States of America.
			b 2. That, as it is utterly impoeaWle for Government to construct throughout British India more than a small por. tion of the works in question, although they are essentially necessary to develope her agricultural and other roeourcer, and to make her prosperous and oontented, and able to bestow upon the people of this country those high com-, merclal benefits they have the right to expect roin her dlrect union with England; and as it Is equally clear that the surplu private capital, E'eii, and energy of Great Brltain are capable, if properly apphed, of producing such works with rapidity and advantage every pos-
			sible facility and encouragement may So given by, Government to all joint-stock companies formed In Englancr who may seek to undertake the construction of well-selected, practlcable, and useful projects of irrigation and navigation, &amp;c. in British Indi ; and,
			' 3. That the proposal now submitted by the Madras Ire rigation and Canal Company for the construction of works of irrigation, he., in the distrlcts of OCsxsa, without a Go- vernmental guarantee, may receive the most favourable con- sideration, and every proper encouragement and support ba given to enable that company to enter upon tho contemzu plated undertaking with the least posdble delay, and in a satisfactory manner, in order that others may, by their suc- cess, be induced to undertake other works of a hke descrlp- tion by means of capital raised In thesame way.
			"An\d your memorilists will over pray, ho.
			"Signed at a meeting of the executivo commlttee of the CRotton Supply Asscla'lon, hald In Manchester the 3d of April, 1800.
			" JOHN CHEETEM, Chairman. "G I. HAYWOOD, Secretary."

			LONDOY, THUBSDAY, APRIL 5, 1860.
			The Indian Despatches which have just been printed record another triumph of political economy. Practice is at length overtaking theory, and abstract principles, after having been allowed their ordinary period of proba- tion, are at length admitted and applied with- out hesitation to the daily affairs of mankind. Many years have elapsed since l\r. I4ICAUDo revealed to the world the true theory of paper money, but it was not till 1844 that those prin- ciples gained their final triumph in this country. Sound as are the doctrines on which the regulation of the English currency is based, and satisfactory as have been the results of that great measure, it has, strange to say, remained hitherto unique. Foreign countries have been ready enough to imitate the device of a State bank of issue and deposit, as a mask behind which to conceal questionable financial transactions; there has been no lack of readiness, either before or since the Act of 1844, to issue Government paper; but the safeguards under which alone that paper can be safely issued have been universally disregarded; and yet it is im- possible to deny that the principles of currency contained in the act of Sir ROBERT PEEL are of universal application, and have no particular relation to the commercial or financial state of England any more than to that of any other country in the world. This truth has tardily disclosed itself even to those statesmen who had the greatest share in assisting Sir ROBERT PEEL to pass the Bank Act; but it is apprehended at last, and we hail the intended establishment of a sound currency in India as a happy result already produced by sending to that country a gentleman who reaUy understands those principles of political economy which no attentive student of that science ever dreams of disputing.
			How necessary such a mission was may be easily judged by any one who wvil take the trouble to read the letter of the Financial Secretary of the Government of India with which the correspondence opens. We had no reason to suppose that the study of financial ques- tions had made great progress in India, but we certainly were scarcely prepared for such doc- trines as the followin.g:-" The objection to this " course" (thatis, issuing notes by the Government) CwiU in a great measure be met if the notes are "receivable at the option of the public and con- "vertible on demand. Generally speaking, it is "in cases in which notes are a legal tender, and "thereby made absolutely to assume the place of " a metaUic currency, that Eeriously evil results "are to be apprehended." We presume that the Financial Secretary of India never heard of the crisis of 1825 or of the Act of 1844. HIad he heard of the first he would have known that notes receivable at the option of the public, and convertible on demaud, can be over-issued to any extent, and with the most fatal consequences, assuming for the time, to all intents and pur- poses, the place of a metallic currency. Had he heard of the second, he would have known that,
			under proper swfeguards, Government can issue' notes, which are a legal tender to every one except the issuer, without any evil result at alL
			Warned probably by the antiquarian style in which the Financial Secretary treated the doctrines of political economy, Mr. 'WUSON evidently thinks nothing ought to be ta'ken for granted, and commencea his Minuto by a complete
			synopsis of al that wve know of the pr-] ciples of curreney. We hope that the Binan-
			cial Secretary has studeed the doctrine laid! down for his benefit, and that he is convinced now that it is not the wisest and soundest policy "to make as large a portion as possible "of the medium actually circulating metallic," but that he holds, with MIr. wn.so.8, that
			a paper currency redaces the cost of the BR4ini eeonomizes the wear and tear of "coin, affords great facilities for remittance, "and enables the Government to become, "without any pecuniary sacrifice, the holder " of a considerable portion of its securities." It is not necessary to go through tho elaborate machinery by whlch Mr. Wiusox proposes to adapt the present system of currency in England to the wants of India. The principles are identical with the Act of 1844, or where they differ they are even more rigorous and scientific. Mr. Wiso2 dis- penses with the agency of a Bank, and proposes to intrust functions exactly similar to those of the Issue Department of the Bank of England to a Board of Government Commissioners in Calcutta. With these he proposes to connect District Boards. A portion, never to be less than one-third of the issue of notes, is to be retained in coin, and against the remainder of the issue Government securities are to be purchased and. held. The public Treasuries are to assist with their funds in case of any sudden emergency. Of course, there is not in India the same knowledge as has been acquired in England of the amount of securities which may safely be held against the issue of notes. The process must in the first instance be tentative, and it is only when confidence has been fully esta- blished that Government can feel itself releved from the necessity of holding a much larger amount of cash than would be thought requisite in this country. As an additional precaution against forgery the notes are to be manufactured in Eng- land. They are to consist of promises to pay 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 rupees; that is to say, they are to range from 10s. to 501. The notes of the Bank of Bengal are to be called In, and the circulation of that bank is to be taken as a guide for the operations of the Government. When the plan has been fairly launched at Cal- cutta it is to be extended to Bombay, Mladras, the Punjab, Oude, and the North-Western Provinces. Two years will be required for the preparation of al the notea, and by the end of that time it is hoped the plan will be in full activity.
			It is not often that we are able to speak of any measure of Government in terms of such commendation as of this wise and well-considered step. Immense sums will be saved in the mere escort and conveyance of bullion to those dis- trict Treasuries, where, according to their pre- sent antediluvian system, the coin required for the payment of the troops and officials is kept. An incredible economy of time and labour will also be achieved by avoiding the necessity of counting every month hundreds of thousands of pounds in two-shilling pieces. A great temptation to rebellion will be removed when the public trea- sure shall be converted from cumbrous silver coin, easy to be found and difficult to be carried away, into a roll of notes which cau be placed in safety, or, if necessary, destroyed, without any ulti- mate loss to their possessor. The spectacle of a bullock hackery guarded by a compauy of Sepoys dragging a few thousand pounds in rupees over an almost impassable road to some out-of-the-way Treasury is an anachronism which need not again be witnessed. Nor is this alL The holders of the notes of the Government wiU have a strong in- terest in its preservation. So far from apprehending any danger to the English rule from an issue of notes properly secured, we believe that no better step could be taken to increase our estimation, not only in India, but over the whole continent of Asia. When it is found that these notes are always paid on demand, as they assuredly will be, if pro- visions modelled on the Act of 1844 are adopted, and when, owing to the publicity of the returns, the Indian public begins to understand the ample safeguards which have been established to insure their convertibility, the superior convenience of paper to gold will have at length its full weight, and our subjects will not fail to appreciate the vast difference in respect of good faith and honour be- tween the British Government and aU others of which they have any experience. In the course of a few years -we shall expect to find the Indian Go- vernment the holder of a very considerable portion of the securities for its owrn debt, and possessing in a well regulated paper currencyastrona guarantee for the fidelity of its subjects and the durability of its dominion.

			Tho dream of African conquest seems to have melted away before the Spanish people under the stern realities of a campaign. Spain, liko her1 famous knight, is apt to tilt at windmills, and to
			preface the exploit with sonorous challenges toi giants and enchanters. A few months ago the Legislature and the Press proclaimed a holy war, which was to renew the days of Gossanvo of Cor- dova. The long feud between Castilian and Mloor was again to be a fit subject for the rhymes of poets and the admiration of ladies; Spain under IsAnELxA IL was to rival the deeds of the fifteenth century, while Europe looked on in wonder at the prowess of the champions of the Cross. Only one country in the world was supposed to regard with an evil eye the new crusade. Of course, this was the old splenetic, perfidious, but, happily, power- less realm of England. England, which had in all ages sought the abasement of the Penin- sula, which had envied Spanish heroism, libelled Spanish virtue, which had always aban- doned Spain in the day of misfortune, and closed her purse-strings when Spanish enterprise languished for want of capital- this selfish, niggardly, and treacherous State was now bent on depriving the world of a magnificent spectacle. From all parts of Spain the troops of. Her Catholic MAjEsTy were gathering for the con- quest of Africa. In a few weeks the Western outpost of Mlahomedanism would be carried by the gallant onset of a Christian army, the hosts of TERMAGAUINv and alAHouD would be swept like chaff before the wind, and Spanish valour would dictate a peace in the pagan city of Fez. Perhaps among the outbursts of passion to which we are accustomed on the Continent there has been none more remarkable than that which followed the note of Lord JoHN RuSsm=r asklng for explanations as to the designs of the Cabinet of 31adrid. The British Foreign Secretary, seeing an unexpected and most unintelligible war suiddenly entered upon by a State not too rich and justly suspected of too great com- plaisance to foreign counsels, took an open and honourable course. He reminded the Spanish Government that the mouth of the MIediterranean was a region in which England, as the mistress of Gibraltar, had no small interest, and urged that Spain should declare at once whether a war begun with a seri-barbarous Power on a shallow pretext was to be made the means of establishing new for- tresses on the southern sido of the Strait. With the conduct of the Spanish Government we have not the least fault to find. General O'Dos-Ersa's Cabinet at once replied that Spain desired only redress for certain wrongs, and that she had no intention of extending her territory by conquest. The peace just concluded has redeemed this pledge, and we trust that the harmony between Spain and this country will be long unbroken. Bnt the reply of their Government brought into full relief the expecta-
			tlons of the Spanish people. If we had demanded that Cuba should be ceded to the Americans, or the Philippines to ourselves, the outburst of wrath could not have been greater. For some weekks Spanish society was closed to Englishmen. The newspapers were full of denunciationzs; even the walls were covered with indignant or jeering remarlks on the perfidious islanders. So hiigh did the fever mount that in one of its paroxysms Spain actually paid a debt which had been due some five-and-twenty years. Anger did what a sense of justice might have been insufficient to effect.
			Vo all now know the results of this African campaign The Spanish troops seem to have fought very well, and we hopo that the couraga and discipline they have evinced wMill be found effective in future campaigns, and in some better cause. Although we are not likely to be moved by the threat of that patriotic jour- nalist who exclaimed " Tetuan or Gibraltar," nor to think that the heroes of the Penin- sula are likely to be as terrible enemies to heretics as they have been to Mussulmans, yet we may say truly that we see with gratification any display of vigour on the part of Spain. To see Spain prosperous, solvent, strong, with a good army, a courageous people, and the deter- mination to be the vassal of no State on earth, is what all Englishmen desire. For this we foug,ht for six years on Spanish ground; for this we sup- ported the claim of the present QuxaY against her uncle, and for this we shall labour, in spite of any outbreaks of Castilian pride. We are glad to learn tlat Spanish soldiers have repulsed their enemis, )hat their cavalry knows how to charge and how to forage, that their engineera were capable of undertaking a siege, and that their ar- tillery made good practice when the Mfoors came within range. But it is now too evident, and our Spanish friends must allow it, that the campaign was scarcely worth undertaking. A considerable army has been taken across a strait, and has worsted a half-savage foe in some petty actions, and taken a miserable town. The troops were transported slowly, and the munitions of war more slowly stil. Week after week did the Spanish General have to linger on the coast, unable even to drive away the hordes who in- sulted his army in their very encampment. The Moors hung about, shot down those who ventured beyond their lines, and tlle Spanish army, harassed by the enemy, and still more by sickness, must have been disenchanted of their hopes before the first effective blow was struck. The fighting was just what might have bean predicted. It has been admirably described by our Special Correspondent, who has done ample justice to the Spanish army; but when civilized troops, armed with the newest and most scientific weapons and instructed in the art of war as taught in Europe, meet the rude levies of a barbarous State, the victory must, of course, bo with the former. Every one must feel that mere victory in the field is not success in such a war, but solid advantages over the enemy, either by reducing them to subjection, or by punisning them so as to prevent any repetition of the offence which led to the war. And, from this point of view, what can the Spaniards be said to have gained? They have only shown what- all the world, probably even the Mloors, knew before,- that they could beat an African force in action. On the other hand, it is plain that with al her exertions, and an expense much beyond her means, Spain has not been able to march an army more than a few miles into Morocco, and that the MIoors may next year be as insolent as ever without fear of a fresh chastisement.
			We cannot be surprised that deep dissatisfaction is felt throughout Spain at the termination of tho war. It is probable that O'DoaNN3a, powerful as he is, will, in spite of his victories and his title of Duke of Tetuan, fall a sacrifice to popular resentment. The Spaniards appear determined to show themselves very Carthaginians in their treatment of the General who has only failed in doing what probably no one else could have done, and whose only fault has been that he encouraged his countrymen to embark on an expe- dition in which success, such as they expected, was impossible. We should be sorry to hear of O'Dox- NEIa?s fall, since, as a Minister, he has succeeded in giving tranquility and prosperity to his country. Spain is a patient not yet out of danger. Three months of a weak and inefficient Minister might bring on years of trouble. What a lesson is taught by the attempt at a Carlist insurrection? After IsAnar.A has been ruling peaceably for years, and just as her reign has been illustrated by victories over the oldest foes of her race, we have one of her own Governors, a General bearing her com- mission, landing with 3,000 men to raise the standard of a Pretender. It is plain that the unpopularity of O'Do2sNL has excited the hopes of the retrograde faction. But what a proof is this of the insecurity of the State, and the foily of rushing into such enterprises as this Moorish war I

			A correspondence very unequally divided be- tween MIr. LixDs&amp;Y and Lord JonN RussELL reopens the question of belligerent rights in time of maritime war. Ar. LiNDSAY recapitulates through six pages the various arguments which have been advanced for exempting merchautmen from the risk of capture; Lord JoHN replies in six lines that the proposal will be duly considered by Govern- ment, but that it appears liable to grave objections. As this is the identical stage at -which we quitted the controversy a month or two ago, we do not seo that the position of the case is much altered, but we agree with Mr. LiNDSAY in thinking that the subject well merits public attention, and the more so, indeed, as the attitude lately assumed by the United States is exceedingly significant.
			Without touching on any debatable points, we may briefly premise that the old code of inter- national law recognized two methods of attacking an enemy's commerce on the high seas in time of 'war. Not only could the regular cruisers of a belligerent State seize and make prize of all vessels carrying the hostile flag, but privateers or private vessels armed for tho purpose might be authorized by letters of marque to participate in the same rights, and to scour the seas in quest of booty, exactly lik; ships of war. Against this latter usage, however, a stand has been made in moderrn times. It has been likened to guerilla fighting on land, and has been stigmatized as a barbarous practice, calculated to aggravate the horrors of war by introducing into its scenes a class of combatants unreitrained by the spirit of professional chivalry. To such good effect were these argaments urged that at the Conference of Paris in 1856 it was agreed by the States taking part in the debates that privateering should bo abolished, and that tho proposition should be brought to the knowledge of other States not parties to the Conference. In particular, the reso- lution was commuticated to the United States, but without anysubstantial result. The American Go- vernment at first expressed its willingness to concur in the declaration of ths Conference, on condition that private property at sea should be exempted from risk of capture altogether, whether by privateers or regular cruisers, but these views have since been changed. The Americans have now receded from the offer thus conveyed, and have, in point of fact, suspended the negotiation on the subject.
			Originally, the American Government displayed considerable reluctance to entertain propositions againSt privateering, and for very obvious reasons.
			It Is the policy of the United States to avoidI standing armaments, and to meet the contingen- cies of war by extemporized means from the resources of a powerful community. If they wish to go to 'War they invite volunteers to reinforce their small army of regular troops, and if they Should embark in maritime hostilities they reckon, -n a similar fashion, on the aid of privateers. 31aving only a small standing navy, they would ba taken at a disadvantage- unless they could rely on this resource ; but, as the Americans are excel- lent seamen and full of enterprise, the ocean would be covered with their volunteer cruisers in a Month after the declaration of war. To be sure, a11 the arguments against the system would be as applicable as ever, but this responsibility the States would accept. They have none of that squeanishuess which has induced us to control cattle thieves in Cafiraria by Lmperial troops, lest the eettlers, if left to themselves, should conduct the war irregularly. They wlould not undertake tho expense of a large national marine, to be main- tained through years of peace against the remote contingency of war. They were equally indisposed to remain at the mercy of a better prepared adversary, and, as the only alternative, they reEled on their privateers. War might be made a worse business than ever by such a system, but that could not be helped.
			As this policy Is very intelligible, it may be asked, perhaps,on what principleorwith what expec- tations the Americans were willing to forego it, and we are not sure that we can answer the question.
			They may, perhaps, be disinclined to relinquish. the resource of a privateer navy; but they may also discern an advantage in allowing things to remain as they stand; and this seems to be Mr. LnsSA'S opinion. Coinciding with those gentle- men who lately addressed Lord PAE sToNw on the subject, MLIr. LiN;DSAY thinks that, unless private property obtains the exemption in question, the Americans, at the first out- break, or even rumour of a war between this country and another, would appropriate the whole of our carrying trade. As a matter of course, con- sIdering their geographical and political isolation, they would, in all probability, be neutrals at a period of European strife, and, as neutrals, they would keep the seas in peace. We, though we might be the strongest Power at sea, and even maintain our traditlonal supremacy, could never guarantee our merchantmen from the chances of accidental en- counters, and that risk, however reduced, would be sufficient, and more than sufficient, to give American vessels a preference over our own. The expense of the insurance required to cover a cargo under the British flag would so in- crease the cost of freight that our ships could not compete with those of the IUnited States, and the Americans would therefore become the carriers of the world. Now, Ar. LnDsAY being, as he describes himself, " a shipowner deeply " interested in the security of his invested capital," and representing, besides, " an important mari- "time borough," looks naturally with little satis- faction at the prospect thus opened, and would fain get the co-operation of Lord JoEw RussmL and his colleagues in obtaining immunity for all private property afloat, and thus intercepting the antici- pated monopoly of our neutral friends.
			We have already expressed our own opinion on this important subject, and it is but little that we need add at present. Assuming even that Mr. INDsSy has proved his case, that case is net the case of the British nation, but of the British ship- owners, whereas what Government has to consider is, not the case of the shipowners, but that of the nation. The question is a national ques- tion of the broadest character, and must not be decided by the interests of any class, however influential. There are two points at issue. Can war be waged, to use Mir. LINDSAY'S own expres- sion, "peace-fashion?" And can we, occupying such a position as we do, safely, or with advan- tage to ourselves, forego the power of excluding our enemies from the highway of the Eeas ? We think not ; indeed, as regards the first point, we may turn to a somewhat forcible ex- ample. War made peace-fashion is the genuine and distinctive policy of the Chinese. That people, being either below or above Europeans in their views of this matter, carry out to the utmost the principle which is advocated by Mr. LINDsAY and his friends, insomuch that in going to war with us they carefally eschew anything like a state of hostilities, and will maintain an exten- sive trade with England at the very moment that we may be marching upon their capital to subvert, perhaps, their dynasty and empire. We are only so far concerned with this policy at present as to ask whether it is conducive to peace. WPould the world gain if every European State were to act in this re- spect on Chinese principles ? We very much doubt It. At any rate, we find in our dealings with China that when war is made peace-fashion it never ceases. Our commerce is kept harmless, no doubt, but no sooner is one expedition concluded than another begins, and it is arguied in some quarters that until we discard this fashion of war- making we shall never get to the end of our trouble. This is certainly not a promising illus- tration, while, as to the balance of profit and loss, that must be computed, not by the prospects of a particular trade, but by the interests of an entire natlin.

			We have received by the last Orerland China Chrlioice some dreadful revelations as to the trade in Coolies. It appears that there is now ~organized in the Southern ports of China a system of kidnapping to the full as bad as any ever prac- tised by the native chiefs of Africa in the worst days of the slave trade. The information is brought before us in a strictly official form. The allied Commanders-in-Chief on the 12th of Jan- uary of the present year addressed a letter upon the subject to the Consular Body at Canton, which -we reprint elsewhere. They enclosed the deposi- tions of 105 men, lately taken frorn certain Coolie meceiving-ships at Whampoa, and we publish also a sample of these depositions. Three of these ships wvere American; the fourth was an Oldenburg bark. The Coolies had been kidnapped, and a nominal consent to an eight years' engagement in Cuba was rung from them by torture. The Com- mnanders-ln-Chief telltheConsuls that theyusedevery precaution to guard against deception In taking the -depositions. Each witness 'was examined separately wnd apart from his companions. The kidnapping process is carried on by the native Chinese, who pick up their unwary countrymen in the suburbs annd outlying portions of the town, and then convey them on board Chinese boats, and so, in due course, on board the foreion ships. The Chinese agents decoy or force their vic- tims on board their boats, and torture them unti they wring from them a consent to become "f ree emigrants." The forms of torture employed are various. Their hands are tied together, and a wedge is hammered in between them. Their thumbs and great toes are tied together, their tails tied up, and they are thus ;hoisted off tho deck and suspended in the air, -while a lighted joss-stick is applied to their anklea. They are ducked in tho river; they are flogged in the most horrible manner; they am threatened with death; they are thrown into the river in baskets; and various -other' forms of torture are employed, until thoy ,consent to dip their finger in ink, and thus impress their mark upon tho " agreement." The iMlan-
			darins, real or supposed, appear to be tho chief agents in these acts of cruelty. But it would be useless to examine into this part of the question at any length, for it is obviously a matter of indifference whether the foreign traders in human flesh ezecute these asts of cruelty by their own hands, or by the hands of their isative agents. The idea that they can be ignorant of the coercion employed to forcea the wretched Coolies on board is too preposterous to admit of discussion.
			We do not suppose that it was the intention of the persons who established this system of Chinese contract labour, as a corrective of the African slave trade, to introduce another system which was just the slave trade over again in another latitude, and in another quarter of the globe. In many respects, indeed, it is worse that a Chinaman should be kidnapped than an African Negro, inasmuch as it can scarcely be pre- tended that a Chinaman is even indirectly the gainer by being removed from a condition of comparative civilization to one of absolute bar- barism. He is worse off as a bondsman in Cuba than when followirng his ordinary occupation in his native town. From other sources we know of the frightful mortality which prevails among the Coolie immigrants who are employed upon the sugar plantations in Cuba. It would be difficult, indeed, to place a human being in a more desperate position, for the Spanish planter does not feel even that moderate degree of interest in his captive which he would in a slave, from the fact that the slave was his own property. Nor is it a fair argument that the Chinese themselves are the chief agents in kidnapping their countrymen. It is the foreign trader, who pays the premium on their perfidy and cruelty. It must also be added, that the Chinese authorities at Canton, who have made formal pro- tests against the system, have a just and reason- ablo cause of complaint against the European Powers and the United States, under whose flags it is carried out. Indeed, as we may gather from the letter of the Commanders-in-Chief, the Chinese authorities, independently of their re- monstrances against this atrocious system of manstealing, have addressed a circular to the foreign Consuls, in which they cal the attention of the Consular Body to t'ne fact that they have organized a regular system of free emigration, and request that the Consuls will require their respec- tive countrymen to conform to the rules upon which that system is based.
			We are rejoiced to see that not one of the four vessels which have been involved in this vile trade bore the English flag. Three of them hoisted the stars and stripes, the other the Oldenburg colours, whatever those may be. It is far indeed from our wish to suggest any interference with the action of the United States, but, as Canton is in the military possession of French and English soldiers, sailors, and marines, 'we are at least bound to give all the support in our power to the Chinese authorities in their reasonable endeavour to prevent the kidnapping of their countrymen. There is, indeed, hope that the public opinion of the United States may be opposed to this process of kidnapping Chinese for the benefit of Spaniards when the matter is placed before them in its proper light. Besides the positive and certain evil inflicted upon so many wretched creatures, another aud a sufficient reason for interfering on behalf of the. Coolies is, that if the kid- napping is persevered in it wil soon put an end to the system of free emigration altogether. If we would set in motion an effective stream of labour from China to our own or to the Spanish possessions, or elsewhere, the result can only be brought about by fair dealing. The Chinese are willing emigrants; proof of the fact is forthcoming at Singapore, in Australia, in California. There is, indeed, no reason why, with common sense and fair dealing, China should not become the great labour-market of the tropical world. All nations, however, must be content to deal with the Chinaman fairly, to involve him in none but voluntary engagements, to pay him a reasonable hire, and so to deal with him in aU things that he may bear favourable report to his countrymen of the treatment which he has received. The man- stealing process now going on at Canton, and which we bring before the notice of our readers this day, if it is not checked, will give the death- blow to the system of free emigration from China, and to all the hopes which might reasonably be founded upon it.

			The United States' mail steamship Vanderbilt, Captain P. E. Lefevre, which left New York at 6 p.m. on the 24th uit., arrived off Cowes about 6 o'clock this morning, and went on to Havre. She brought the usual mails, 92 passengers, and $250,060 for England and France.
			The Canada steamer arrived at Ealifax on the 23d, and the screw steamer Etna at New York on the morning of the 24th.
			At 7 a.m. on the 2d inst., in lat. 49, long. 15X28, the Vanderbiltexchanged signals withthe American ship Flora Southard, of Richmond.
			Iu Congress, on the 21st ult., the Senate passed the House Bill providing for the protection of female passengers on board emigrant ships. A reso- lution calling on the President to inform the Senate if any instructions have been given to our naval officers by which the United States' naval forces wera to take part In the civil war in Mexico, and by what authority the 3Iexican war steamers were re- cently captured, was adopted. The President was also called upon to communicate the correspondence that has taken place with reference to the diffi- culties between the judicial functionaries of Utah territory. The Florida Claims BiU wa3 debated, and its further consideration postponed till the 16th of A pril. In the House a resolution was proposed, caling for information relative to the capture of
			the Mexican war steamers in the Gulf, but its intro- duction w-as objected to.
			On the 22d the Senate passed the BiU to establish mail routea in Kansas territory. A resolution was adopted caUing for information relative to the ex- pulsion of a naturalized citizen of the United States from Prussia in 1857. A Bil providing that per- sons, by endorsing their names on letters sent by mail, can have them returned free of postage when undelivered, was passed. The Pacific Railroad Bill and amendments thereto were ordered to be prlnted. The Homestead Bill was then taken up. A motion was made to substitute the House for the Senate Bill, and the Committee on Public Lands reported in favour of the Senate Bill. An Interesting debate ensued, in which Messrs. Clingman, Hale, and WigfaU took part. The discussion took a wide range, embracing, among other subjects, the New England strikers, and the relations between the North and the South. In the House the Senate's amendment to the BiU providing for the protection of female emigrants on shipboard was agreed to, and. the Bill passed, and only awaited the President's signature to become law.
			Nothing of Importance transpired in Congress on the 23d, both Housoe being engaged upon the private calendars.
			A despatch from Washington states that
			" The seizure of the Mexicau vessels by Commander Turner was not made under any special instructions from here bearing upon the conflict now going on In Mexico, but under the usage which provaUs among all national vessels- The captured vessels were sailing without a flag, and, when requested in the usual way to stop, by firlng a gan across the bows, replied by firing into the Amerlcan national ship. As a matter of conrse, such conduct was promptly pnnished by the capture of the vessels. From their conduot the in- ference was strong that they were either filibusters or pirates, and as such it was the duty of tho commander of the Saratoga to overhaul them. The seizure has no connexion whatever with the present im broglo in Mexico, and so the President will inform Con. gress if called upon. The prisoners will probably be liberated by the President if they shaU show they were not violating the neutrality laws, and did not kill any American citizen by first firing on the Indlanola. The Government 15 determined, however, to demand of Spain whether these vessels were fitted out at Havannah witb the cognizance oE the Spanish officials, for the purpose of interfering with our commerce. Unless Spain can clear her sklrts of this com. plicity itis more than probable oar neutralitylawvs, so far as Spain is concerned, will be suspended this session by an almost unanimous vote."
			The following are the latest telegrams received at New York respecting the capture of the Spanish- Mexican war steamers by the United States' Gulf squadron:
			" 1NEW ORLEANS, MA2tun 21. "The Mexican mals of the 11th nst. are to hand.

			" Ron. Isaac Toucey,'Secretaryof the Navy.-Sir,-Meu- tenant Chapman left Vera Cras on the 11th inst., in com- mand of the prize steamer Marquis of Havannah, as bearer of despatches to the department from Captain Jarvis, but learning on my arrival here this morning that he had not arrived, I deem it my duty to forward the following report to you:-
			"On the 5th inst. General Miramon commenced the siege of Vera Cruz, and on the 6th General Marin appeared before the city with this and another steamer, and not show- ing his colourg, Commander Tmrner, in the Saratoga, with detachmentsfrom the Savannah and Preble, in the steamers Indlanola and Wave, was ordered to proceed to the anchorage of the steamers, off Anton LIzardo, and ascertain their character. Upon nearing them one of them was seen to be moving off, when a shot was fired ahead of her to bring her to, and the Indianola sent to overhaul her. The hail from the Indianola was replied to by a fire from the General Miranaon's guns and a voliey of musketry, when the Saratoga fired a broadside and the actlon became genera], resulting in the capture of both oflMarln's steamers, with himself and a large number of his men on board.
			" Captain Jarvis ordered both prizes to this port. The Preble will be here in a few days, with Marnn and most of the prisoners on board, the rest being distributed between this steamer and the Marquis of Havannab.

			The steamship Granada, which left New York on the morning of the 23d ult., had on board a detach- ment of 553 recruits, sent to fil vacancie3 among tne United States' troops on frontier service in Texas. The l,a,tAt portion are to disembark at Indiano]a, and the milnor pv;iofl Will proceed to Brazos Santiago.
			By the overland mail we have news frot Call- fornia to the 3d of MIarch. The Democratic State Convention for the choice of delegates to the Cnarleston Convention had been held. Neither of the factions of the democracy were able to control the convention. A fulllist of delegates was selected and among the resolutions adopted was one in favour of Daniel S. Dickwinson for tne Presidency. There had been no arrival at San Francisco from Atlantic ports, except the 5hip Huntsville, from Boston. Commercial affairs remained mnuch the same as previously reported.
			By way of New Orleans we have accounts from Havannah to the 19th ult. Sugar was more active at slightly reduced rates, and freights were advanc- ing. Therewas nogeneralnewsof importance.
			The oyster sloop E. A. Johnson, of Islip, Lgong Island, was found abandoned in the lower bay at New York on the mornaing of the 21st ult., under cir- cumastances which led the police to beEieve that the captain and crew have been murdered and their bodies thrown overboard. The cabin of the vessel was covered with blood and human hair, as also the deck, and the general appearance of things on board denotes that the sloop has been the scene of a san- guinary and desperate struggle. The E. A. John- son was towed up to the city by the steam-tug Cere3, and moored in Fulton-market slp. The coroner and the poRlce took the matter under investigation. A second edition of the Ntew Yerk h'erald, published at 130 p.m. on the 24th, has the following:-
			" This mornig Captain Weed, of the second preCinct police, received a telegraphio despatch from detective Nivens to the effect that Johnson, the suspected murderer of the captain and crew of the oyster sloop E. A. Johnson, vws under arrest, and would soon be on his way to New York. The prisoner, It appears, took the Fall River boat, and not the Stoningion one as was at first supposed, and immediately after reaching Fall River he took the cars for Providence, Rhode sland, where he was arrested at an early hour this morning. He was found on the outskirts of the city, in an out-of-the-way place, where ,he had engaged private lodgings for himself and family. Tho officers vatched the house for several hours before they deemed it prndent to arrest him. Johnson will arrive by the afternoon train, which reaches this city at 20 minutes past 5 o'clock."
			A special despatch of the 22d from Washington has the following in reference to the United States' relations with Japan:-
			" Consul-General Harris, writing from Yeddo to the Secretary of State, says that American affairs there are ln an unsatisfactory condition. The Japanese evade the fath- ful observation of the most important of the treaty stipula. tions or meet them with a passive resistance. He adds that he is unwearied in his efforts to convince the Government of the dangerous course it is pursuing, and until its eyes are opened to the periIs It incurs by its present course no change for the better can be looked for. The doouments sent to the Senate to-day mention the fast that Lord Rigin has re quested the Japanese to send an ambassador direct to Eng land, but they evaded the applleation, giving this country the preference. Orders were sent out by the Secretary of the Navy to land the Embassy to this country at New York, but our Consul-General urges that they be brought directly to Washington. They will be entertained at the publio ex- pense. The high dignitaries and servants number 73."

			COMMCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
			The money-market at New York was without change, tho tendency being to increased ease. Money was freely offered to the brokers at 6 per cent., and at the discount houses the complaint was of a scarcity of paper.
			Foreign exchange for the Vanderbilt was very fiat, the asking rates at the bankers' boing 108i to 4 for sterling, and 5 164 to 174 for francs. Very few transastions at these figures were heard of, the wants of remitters being supplied by the cotton shippers.
			The following are the last quotations of sight exchange on New York at the clties mentioned, the quotations being In all cases for gold :-Chicago, * to A pm.,; St. Louis, 4 to 1 pm.; Cincinnati, A pm.; INe;w Orleans, i pm.; Baltimore, 1-10th pm.; Mobile, 4 pm.; Philadelphia, par.
			The stock-market was steady, without particular anima- tion. At the opening there was a lively inquiry for Galena, Rock Island, Michigan guaranteed, and Iilinois Central, and all these stocks sold at the best prices of the previous after noon. At the close of the first board the sellers caused the market to decline a fractlon; in the afternoon there was very little business done, and prices were generally rather lower, closing dlli at the decline. The inquiry for State stocks and approved bonds continnesvery active; all that wereon tne market were readily taken, and several classes of bonds which had been in disfavour for some time were beginning to be inquired after. The closing quotations of the day were :-Virglnia Sixes, 931 to M; Missouri Sixes, 804 to 4. Canton, 201; Cumberland Preferred, 13.4 to 14; PacHici Mail, 9741 to N; New York Central, 744a to 4; Erie, 92 to 10; Hudson River, 383 to a; lHarlem, 94 to 4; Harlem Preferred, 343 to 4; Reading, 41 to A; hichigan Central, 41 to 4; Michigau Southern and Northern Indiana, 94 to 10; ditto, Guaranteed, 21 to 4; Panama, 1334 to 1'4; Illinois Central, 624 to 4; Galena and Chicago, 61 to i; Cleveland and Toledo, 204 to 21; Chicago and Reck Island, 643 to 65.
			The import entry of dry goods for the week ending on the 23d ult. was less than that for the corresponding week of last year, the figures being $2,627,000, against $3,530,000 same week last year, and $1,235,000 same week of 1858. This, however, was probably an accident, due to the non- arrival of steamers freighted with French and German goods. The aggregate import since January 1 was $33,175,000, against $31,060,000 to the same date last year, and $12,582,000 to same date of 1858. The year's imports of dry goods will undoubtedly be in excess of last yeaes.
			The business of the Sub-treasury was as follows :-Total receipts, $105,392 40c.; for Customs, $90,000; ,total pay- ments, $35,463 46c. ; balance, $8,110,578 27c.
			The exchanges at the bank clearing-houises were $ 21,576,147 72c., and the balances $1,230,844 67c.
			The IWeso Ymr* Hereld had received the annual state- ment of the Illinois Central, to be submitted to the share- holders in advance of the May meeting, and quotes the folloadg paregap,
			"The earnings of the road in 1859 were $2,114,448 9Sc., a^.nd in 1858, $1,076,578 52. In the early part of the year the distress in Illinois, from the failure of the harvest of the two preceding years, caused such inactivity in business that our traffic diminished oven fromn the low figures of the ure- ceding year. For tho first eight months the dccreaseowas $85,091 23c. In September, after the wheat harvest, busi- ness improved, and mn the last two months the Indian corn crop coming opportunely made up the deficit, and gave an increase of $130,803 40c. for the year. The lowest point in our affairs has apparently passed and the very satisfactory increase of local traffic during six months ending the 29th ult. of $324,290 41c. confirms the estimate in the Dlecember circular of a gain of 33 1-3 per cent., or S700,000, the present year. This will exceed the earnings of 1856; and it is worthy of note that even during 1859 the falling off in freight earnings compared with 1856, our best year, Is only 5 per cent. ; the figures were $1,107,019 10oc. In 1859, against $1,156,471 23c. in 1856. In the year 1856 there was a large through freight traffic to the north-west; the rivers were low, and merchandise was forced upon the railways, which has not been the case since. Although the harvest of grain to the acre cultivated in 1859 was less than half of that gathered to the acre in 1856, the extended area under cultivation has shown a better result in the exports from Chicago than was anticipated, and demonstrates that the work- ing population and surface cultivated have increased largely since 1856. In that year, with very abundant harvests. and such high prices that avery available bushel of grain was broeght out, 21,588,221 bushels were shipped from Chicago - the past year, 1859, after two had harvests, and a thirdwhilch was only partial, there were 16,663,795 bushels sent to Chicago. Therefore, It is behleved that the first year in which ful harvests of wheat and Indian corn are gathered will be foilowed by an export of 30,000,000 bushels. In 1840 the total export was 40,000 bushels of wheat. The passenger traffic of 1856 was benefitted by the emigration to Iowa and Minnesota; this has been almost entirely cut off, and the local passenger travel much reduced from the poverty of the farmers ; the decline is from $1,112,401 78c. in 1856 to $811,411 90c. in 1859, or $300,989 8Sc. decrease. Ve are now gaining in our pas- sengers to and from the Sonth, since the opening of the lines to New Orleans and Memphis. The working ex- penses for 1859 were $1,4S9,579 52c., against $1,419,954 S0c. an 1858; an increase of $69,624 72c. For maintenance of way and of machinery $90,032 02c. more is charged than In 1858, The directors will confine themselves t.o remarlingthat the tariffs for transportation of freight have not been reduced, that the promise of a large traffic in coal is very encouraging, and that the Southern trade at the Cairo outlet, of wheat, oats, flour, corn, and provisions, is largely inrzeasing, accompan,ied by again in the return freights of sugar, cotton, molasses, coffee, and fruit.
			Atrthe argent request of the London coammittee, the directors deferred calls in 1853 and 1859, although they be- lieved then, as they d ahe present moment, thatrthe fact of this company, situated as it is, with aUarsessed capTl
			presenting itself as a borrower for short periods, at high rates of interest, has been the chief reason for the deprecia- tion of its securitIes in public estimation. The call of $10 per share, payable the let of February, will dis- charge nearly all the debentures due in 186, with meet of the floating debt; this latter will probably fall below $;400,000, when the paymnents of the call are concluded. The settlements of the call1 were made to a greater extent than was estimated in the sterling 1861 debentures, which, it was supposed, would haveo been absorbed nuder the full pay plan. The entries of foil paid shares since the 1st of February have been less than the directors anticipated; hence the cash payments in London were insufficient to provide for liabili- ties maturing there, and to meet an unexpected eigency tbe directors were compelled to resort to temporary loans,which
			reflect Injuriously upon the company's credit, and they are, therefore, determined to pat an end to the necessity for them, by callng upon the shares for a sufficlent amount to liquidate the entire 9osting deb' and to provide a surplus for contingencies. To this end a call upon the shares will be made payable the 15th of May, of S5 per share, vrhich wUl cancel every outstanding liabUity of the company, vith the exception of such free lud bonds as arc not surrendered to the company in payment for full paid shares, and ths balance of the construction bonds due in 1S7a .
			':"The resident of tbo company hus of late had no inter- mission fim the labour and responsibilities of his office. He has stated to the hoard his determination to withdraw from his official position, desiring them to transfer the management to other hands at an early day. The direc- tors prefer to relieve him from the financia1 part of his duties, and to appoint a chairman of their execative com- mittce for the discharge of the duties which for two years past have confined the president to New-York. This ar- rangement wll affordhim moretimetoattendto the general supervision of the company's interests, which are daUy as- sumning a vider range. The experience of the past vear has confirmed the Boaria in the opinion expressed in the last annunalreport, that it is not practicable toact with sufficient promptness and efficlency in concert with a committee of shareholders in London, inssmuch ss a decision Upon tho company's affairs cannot be speedily arrived at by corre- spondence; therefore the Board wdil consider their relatlons with the committee as terminated, unless otherwise directed at the nexKt meetig of the shareholders. We are informed that a majority of the present committee concur in this opinion."
			The Chicago Press, speaking of buslness at the West and crop prospects, says-
			" The weather during the week has been delightful, smd the farmers throughout the West have been improvlng the Reason in sowlngW thir wheat, oats, and barley and in pre- paring the ground for the corn crop. With sezara to Epring wheat, it is estimated that fully two-thirds of thc crop has been sown; and never before-at least for many years-has the weather been so favourable. The intenst hest of the sun has completely thawed out the soil, and ren dered it thoronghly pliable, while the almost complete I absence of rain bas enabled agricnltmists to push thbis work through witbout hindrance or delay. The reports with regard to the winter wheat crop are conflicting. In those sections where the seed was planted deep it is alimost universally good, while in places where it has been carelesdy sown and harrowed it Is generally poor, and will be a par tial failure. The want of rain is, however, beginning to creste fears that the Western rivers will not aold out long forthe pus-poses ofnavigation. Thou pper Midsssppi, which is not yet open to St. Paul, is falss falling, and jthe merchante; of St. l,ouis are beginning to fear that their trade with the upper Country will bo curtailed in consequence. The same is truze of the 3llinois, and, in fact, to some extent of all Western rivers."
			The New York cotton-marl-e' on the 23d continued to wear the same dull complexion -which bad characterized it for several days, and especially for the low or ordinary grades, whUe tho higher and better qualities were un- changed. The sales embraced 6llO to 800 bales, closing at the followinv nuntatien-

			FRA.NCB AND BBLGIUAf.
			The following is the despatch addlressed by the French Government to its diplomatic agents abroad, in order to reassure the Powers as to the intentions of France in respect of Belgium and the left bank of the Rhine:-
			" Paris, March 19, 1S60.
			" Monsleur,-Ti the despatch which you have dono me the honour to write me you announce that you havo for- warded to -the communication of the Emperor's Go- vernment, under date of tho 13th of this month, relative to Savoy and the county of Nice, and youa add that the prim- cipal Secretary of Stato of - reserves to himself the taking advice of the Council before maling known to us the answer of the - Government. In the meanwhilo I think it desirable to resume with you the discussion of a point which I merely Indicated in my previons corre- spondence, and to Insist especlally on an objection which was brought forward in the discussionstowhich thequestion gave rise.
			" Analogies, in fact, are alleged, and theso are a starting- polnt for distrust. But do these analogies rest on facts, and does there truly exist a relation between our position with regard to the Alps and our situation on tho Rhine t Without doubt the treaties of 1815 had constituted in the North a state of things not without resemblanco and con- naxion with that which still exists at this day on tho sido of the Alps. The kingdom of the Low Countries had been created with a view similar to that with which the terri- torial limits of Sardinia had beon settled. iike Sardinle, it had the custody of positions which permittod it to deliver up the approaches and entrances of our territory to foreign armies.
			" After a duration of 15 years the arrangements have been greatly modified, with the concurrence of the great Powers themselves. Belgium has been formed, and ita neutrality, acknowledged by Europe, has covered from that time all that part of oar frontier which was exactly the most exposed, and for which France might feel the mo3t reason- able anxiety.
			' In a word, wvhatever of a menacing nature for us, in the North, was presented by the treaties of 1815 has been made mere matter of his'ory by the Conference of London. We have no longer on that side any sort of guarantee to demand, and our plan of defenoc, supported by our most Important strong places, shelters us completely from dangers analogous to those of which we should have more than ever to take account at another point, if Piedmont, with its new proportions, remained in possession of terri- tories which give access to thevery heart of the empire. On the Rhino the peril has disappeared, while it has increased in the Alps.
			" Thus the situatlons the similarity of which It Is at- tempted to show present no point of resemblance, and tho potent considerations which oblige us to claim the aunem- ation of Savoy are without any possible application to the state of things in the east and in the north of Franum This combination will completo that which Europe itself has adopted, by effacing the last trace of stipulations manifestly conceived in a spirit of dLitrust and aggres- sivenem towards us; and, far from finding therein a source of disqnietude, Germany will only have occasion to see in it a new condition of the stability and duration of the peace.

			FOREIGLN INTELUGENCE.
			FRANCE.
			,A portion of the following appeaed In outr Econd caIion of ye3erday -]
			(RaO3M OUR OW, CORUESPOhNDEIiT.)
			PARIS, TuEsDAY, APRIL 3, Pr.M.
			Mly Spanish letters have alluded lately to a pro- jected movement on the part of the Carlists in Spain. Wo have to-day the inteligence that a movement under unusually serious circamstances bas actually taken place.What the telegraph announces is this,- that General Ortega, at the head of 3,000 men, has proclaimed the Pretender, Don Carlos, King of Spain, by the title of Charles VI.; and that the movement was at the latest date concentrated at Tortosa, near Valencia.
			From my own private sources I learn that Count Montemolin, now proclaimed as Charles VI., arrived in Paris 10 or 12 days back; that he met here Cabrera (with whom he became reconciled after a long estrangement), General Elio, and some others of less note; that he proceeded to the Balearic Islands, of which Ortega, formerly an ultra- democrat, vas Captain-General; that Ortega and the garrison proclaimed Don Carlos; that they landed at Valencia, where they were well received, and Montemolin also proclaimed, it is said, by the troops. Montemolin was accompanied by Cabrera and Elio in the expedition; Elio, who is a native of Navarre, no doubt to try to raise the north, and Cabrera Catalonia and part of Valencia. A friend of Cabrera has advanced 24,0001. to Monte- niolin.
			A. Louis Veuillot, the ex-editor of the rUnivers, left Paris some six weeks or two months since for Rome. He had, after the suppression of his paper, accepted from a French capitalist the place of in- spector of the Poman railroads. On leaving Paris he found himself in the same carriage with a re- spectable-looking man, of good address and aggree- able manners. They soon entered into conversa- dion; the stranger appeared charmed at findinu
			himself with so famous a person, and . Venfil1o't learned with pleasure that his attractive acquaint- ance was also on his way to Rome on some commer- cial matters. They agreed to travel in the same carriage, to put up at the same hotels, and even at the same lodging-houge iu the Eternal City. Their acquaintance grewv closer as they went along, and by the time they reached the end of their journey they were to all appearance She heat friends in the world. hi. Veuillot an- nounced after aome weeks that circumstances com- pelled him to return to Paris. His friend expressed deep regret at his speedy departure. and said that he himself wanted only two or three days more to finish his business, when he also intended to return to France, and that it was a pity they could not come Iback together I M. VeuiUot observed that, after all, a day or two did not much matter, and that he would wait for him. He did wait, and both arrived in Paris last Sunday morning. They pro- ceeded to the same ho'tel. i1. Veuillot went out for a bath; his friend took another direction. On the former returning to his lodging he was informed, to his astonishment, that police agents had been to his apartment, and had seized his portmanteau, contain- in_ his papers, &amp;c. He went at once to the Pre- lecture of PoHce, and one of the first persons he
			ebhold was the amiable companion of his journey, who turned out to be nothing more nor less than an ngent of the secret polce. He gave information that M. Veuillot had brought important despatches for the Papal Ntucio in Paris. 3l. Veuillot de- nanded his papers; some were restored to him, but the greater part, to the address of the Nuncio, re- ained. He went off instantly to the Nuncio, and Informed him of what had happened. His Ex- cellency was greatly excited; he went straight to the Foreign-office, demanded explanations, and declared that if his papers were not given up he would there and then break off all diplomatic re- lations with the French Government, demaaid his passports, and ouit Paris. It was explained that the seizure of the papers was in consequence of information being given that M. Veuillot was made the channel of communication between the clergy and the Court of Rome, -with a view to certain muanifestations on the part of the clergy in the matter of the bulls of excommunication. The Nuncio's demand was, however, complied with, and the paDers Liven uD.
			The Nuncio's case was so far weak that M1. Veuillot had forgotten or neglected to have himself described in his passports as a courier, or as a bearer of de- spatches to the Pope's AmbasEsador in Paris. There was no seal on the papers, and otherwise nothing official about them; and, moreover, it was an infrac- tion of the Post-office regulations to bring letters or despatches as a private peson. The :Nncio has got his tapers ; Al. Venillot has got those that belonged to him, and will doubtless take care not to be too in- timate with the plausible persons he may happen to zheot in a railway carriage when next he goes to Rome. The matter is a good deal talked about here, +nd, as people laugh at most things, it is a good sibject for pleasantry.
			A few days baclk the Siece published in a promi- nent part of its columns the formula of excommu- nication pronounced by the Court of Rome as apropos of the censure issued by the present Pope against the " actors, promoters, advisers," &amp;o., of the annexation of the Romagna. The formula given by the Sie was copied by the Opinion Nationale, and subsequently by the other less known Governmental papers. The Sidcle and Opinion ac- companied the formidable document with divers remarks on its enormity, and expended a good deal of learning on excommunications in general. Both those papers pique themselves on their theolonical learming, and are popularly considered as infalible authorities on those subjects. MIAL Louis Jourdan and Guerault having formerly been themselves high priests, or something of the sort, in the St. Simo- nian Conventicle founded by Pere Enfantin, were naturally supposed to be strong in theology, canon law,Papal bulls, briefs, rescripts, &amp;c. lWhen the SiSde and Opinion -Nationale first gave to the world this ex- communication it struck me that I had seen some- thing like it before, and I suspected that, like the old tin sconce which Blartinus Scriblerus took for an an- clent Roman shield, the Side's oxcommunication was of doubtful genuineness. In truth, what it took for PiusIXA.'s excommunication is nothing more nor less than the grotesque malediction in Tristram Shiandy, which Dr. Slop reads while " my uncle Toby" whistles " Lil]ibullero." I see some one has given a bint to the M:onde about the matter, and the Mond'e very naturaly makes tho most of it.
			The last number of the Bcvune Contemporaine con- tains an artcle on the social and political character of the English aristocracy, and -o which present circumstances give pecular interest. The Revue cosstemnporainc, though an avowed supporter of the present form of government in France, differs in some respects from the other defenders of the Im- ,erial system, and does not refuse to render justice Ito our institutions, and give to its readers informa- tion on matters which it vwould be advantageous for them to know. If French journalists took some pains to become acquainted with a country almost within sight of their shores, they would not fal into the ludicrous blunders they do every day. iL Grand- guillot, In the Constitutionnel of Saturday, informs the world that it is aU a mistake to suppose England 1- represented by either House of Parliament or by its press. Thoso who were under the impresaion hitherto that the House of Commons was composed of the representatives of the people, and that a free press was the channel through which public opinion was mspressed, will now find they were in error. M1. Grandguliot is apparently hard to bo pleased. Seeing that neither the English Parliament nor the English press knows anything of England or the 9:nglisb, I have some suspicion that AL. Grand- guillot very modestly thinks that le bimself and The Con-stUitcion,el are the only true exponents of 'English interests.
			31. Louis Jourdan also condescends to lecture us in the SiWce. He highly disapproves the way in -which the Government, Parliament, the press, and ,the entire nation think, speak, and act. He kindily i;dvises us to take care of what we are doing, is of Opinion that wo deserve his displeasure, and clearly thinks tha. if we do not take his advice we must " go to the dogs." MM3. Jourdan and Graudguillot -would do well to read the Ret-ue Contemporaine.
			M. Benedetti, whose arrival in Paris wa3 prema- urely announced in the French papers, did not re- un here from Italy until Sundaylast. Several 'Bpledmontese officers of superior rank re likewise sexpected In Paris. They have been selected by :Victor Emmanuel to sett-le the boundaries of the lately ceded province9 in conjunction withi Frendi fom-misiones appointed by the Emperor. Mapia of
			the provinces have already been prepared under the direction of Marshal Randon, which wiU serve as a guide to the commissioners in fixing the boundaries.
			The Municipal Council of Paris bas concluded a contract for the construction of two theatres on the Place du Chatelet-one an Equestrian Circus and the other a Lyric Theatre. The contractor has bound himself to have the two theatres ready for the reception of their companies within eight months from the day of signing the contract. The MIunicipal Council is occupied not only in beauti- fying Paris, bat is likewise taking precautions to protect it against fire. For that purpose it has voted funds for the construction of three barracks for sapeusrs-pompiers (firemen) in the noely annexed quartera of Paris. One is to be built at GreneUe (15th arrondissement), another at Passy (16th ar- rondissement), and the third at BeUevillo (20th ar- rondissement). These three new quarters, at a con- siderable distance from any post of firemen, since their own corps were suppressed at their annexation to Paris on the 1st of January last, have been greatly exposed to accidents from fire.
			It is expected that the magnificent new street, the Rue du Louvre, will be completed by the end of the present month.
			The establishment of docks and the sale of mer- chandise by warrants, an idea borroweed from Eng- land, appear at length about to be adopted in France. A great prejudice existed against the plan on this side of the Channel, first because it was intro- ducedby the Republicans of 1848; secondly, because in France an advance of money on a warrant for the delivery of mercbandise is looked upon as a pawn- broking transaction, and any merchant doing so would be considered as labouring under pecuniary difficulties. A more healthy feeling on the subject is sprlnging up according as it is better understood, thanks to some clever works which have been pub- lished on the matter, and among them one by IhL Maurice Block, which the author read on Satur- day last to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. In this work the advantaaes to be de- rived from general warehouses (the name by which establishments authorized toissue warrants are known in France) are explained with great force. M. Maurice Blockfurther demonstrates that in a great number of cases credit among French merchants is not founded on confidence, but on the certainty of the solvency of the debtor, and more frequently on securities or pledges of which the creditor obtains possession in one shape or other. There are other ideas suggested in the work of W. Maurice Block which appear to be new, and to merit the attention of political eco- nomists. This work is to be inserted in the minutes of the Academy, and will form the introduction to a pamphlet in which M. Damaschino, a young ad- vocate, explains the French law with respect to gene- ral warehouses and warrants.

			RUSSIA.
			The following letter is dated St. Petersburg, the 25th of Mlarch:-
			" The entire attention of this country Is directed towards London, Paris, and Turin. The population appear to have forgotten their dearest interests, to look for news from Great Britain and France. Telegraphic despat^hes received from these quarters are eagerly read, both by military men and civilians. Commercial affairs are In a state of stagna- tion; there is no money current, and the attacks of the journalists against the directors of joint-stock companies are not calculated to restore credit. To add to the dstress, we are suffering from the severest winter experienced by the oldest inhabitant. The railways are in some places covered with snow to the depth of ten feet. The consequence is, that the trains are frequently stopped, and tho engineers think themselves happy when they can retamr to the point from which they started. The extraordinary num- ber of robberies at present noticed Is attributed to the prevailing poverty. A few evenings since the Graud Duke hlichael quitted the Winter Palace on foot, to visit a military establishment on the other side of the Neva, and while crossing the river on the ice he was stopped by two men, enveloped in the caf tan, who deliberately stripped him of hls pelisse, and told him with the greatest effrontery to hasten his pace, or he might saffer from the cold. The Duke returned to the palace, and informed tho Director of Police of his mischance Police agents were dospatched In every direction to search for the highwaymen, but without success. The adventure has caused mruah amusement among the middlo classes, as the Duke Is supposed to be very penurious, and to be mueb grieved at the loss of his cloak, composed of rare for, and valued at 5001.
			" The number of births in St. Petersburg In 1858 amounted to 17,685 (9,174 boys, 8,511 girls), whilo the deaths were 19,077. This fact, which occurs every year, demonstrates that, as the deaths exceed the births, the po- pulation of that city is only kept up by immigratlon. The number of illegitimate births Increases, while marrlages are diminishing. At Moscow the number of births was 11,267 (5,822 boys and 5,443 girls), and that of deaths, 11,703."

			PALESTTNTh
			A letter from Jerusalem of the 14th ult., published in the Monde, contains the following intelligence:-
			" The public places of Jerusalem, so lonely and sLent for ten months of the year, aro gradually assuming a more lively aspect at the approach of the Easter solemnities, always attended by crowds of Christian pilgrims of all com- munions, countries, and ages. As usual, the Greeks and dissentng Armenians are the most numerous, but there does not seem to be quite so many of them this year as in lS58 and 1859. As to the Russians, who come at all seasons, and in yearly increasing numbers, about 600 hsve already arrived, and half of them started last week on an excursion to Nazareth and Samaria, with the irntention of returning to Jerusalem for the Holy Week. Among the 60 western pilgrims now hero, nearly all of whom lodge at the CasaNnova, we have an Archbishop of Chil', Mfonsignor Ra- phael Valdivieso, who, after visiting the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles at Rome, has come with two of his priests to venerate the sepulchro of Jesus Christ. His arrival at Jerusalem was preceded by that of three Italian Bene- dictines and three missionaries from India. We may also noto the presence at the Holy City of the pious widow of the Ban JeDachich, who, In a critical moment, rendered such eminent services to the Austrian empire; thds lady is visiting tho sanctuarles of the Holy Land, in company with the family of Count Charles de Seitern. Among the travellers of distinction expected here at Easter I may mention the Count de Paris and the Duke do Chartres, who are travelling in Egypt under the names of Counts de ViDiers. The Russian gonsul at Jerusa'em purchased for his Government some few months since a piece of ground covered with ruins, situate inltra mrcm os, of no great extent, but most important owing to Its historical associations and its proximity to the Holy Sepulchre. On this spot stood the celebrated church and monastery of St. Mary, built by order of Charlemagne at the beginning of the ninth century, and by him confided to the care of the Benedictines of Clany Charlemagne gave the monastery an extensive library, and endowed it with a yearly income, besides land, vineyards, and gardens In the valey of Jehosaphat. In this monastery western pilgrims used to find a generous hospitality tiU the fanatical Ihaliff Hachem swept away nearly all the religious monuments of the Holy Land. Some years after several merchants of Amalfi, in the kingdom of Naples, who carried on a considerable trade with Egypt and Syria, obtained from Mouzafer, the Sultan of Egypt, the rnins of the Convent of St. lary, and erected a new church and monastery for the same purpoes. The newestablishmentbbeing foundtoosmalltoaffordthenecessary hospitality, another was built by its side to receive women with a church or chapel dedicated to St. -ary Magdalen. The services of the church were performed by the Bone. dictines in Latin The whole of these buildings received the name of St. Mary Latin. After tho capture of Jeru. salem by Saladin, St. Mary Latln underwent tho same fate as most of tho Christian establishments, and was almost totaLly destroyed.

			LORD DUA'DOZVALD./
			If Lord Dandonald be able to finish as he has begun the record of his career upon the sea, we may safely predict for the work an unbounded popu- larity. It will be put into the hands of the young to excite their ardour, it wiU be devoured in stealth by some of theL whose parents have a horror of thesea, and regard the inclinations of their children as a poor len does the roving disposition of her ducklings; it will be another illastration of the heartiness with -which Englishmen sympathize in al daring- adventures and in the way3 of seamen. In the writing of a great Admiral we do not expect per- fect art; but nature is more than art, and the rough truth is more entrancing than rhe most cunningly devised narrations. Lord Dnadonald has great deeds to record, and the force of his facts and of his feelings carries our interest in spite of a straggling style and, at times, a seeminglv superfluous minute- ness of detail. Perhaps even the mention of these defects is hypercriticism, for as we turned over the pages of Lord Dandonald's narrative we could not help feeling that we had been familiar with the same zigzag arrangement of events and elaboration of details in the story of Retinson Crusoe, and that these very points had been among the greatest charm of Defoe's masterpiece. The charm lies in this, however-that they give an air of reality to the veriest fiction, not that they are in themselves attractive; and Lord Dundonald's history needs no such tinting to make it appear more truthful. Our author, indeed, has made great advances as an his- torian since the publication of his last work, which was devoted to an account of his operations on the coast of South America. In reviewing that work ive took the liberty of stating that, like the narra- tives of all sailors, it hadone weakness-it proceeded on the true nautical principle of taking advantage of every wind, tacking right and left, to the bewvilder- ment of landsmen, who feel the wind blowing one way, see the ship going another way, and have not the faintest idea as to tho destination of the craft. In his new volume Lord Dundonald has so far got rid of this tendency that we can follow him with ease, and feel that if his work were put forth as a fiction it would be admired for the skill of its narrative in the imitation of truth. As it is, this autobiography is worthy of one of the very best places on any shelf of military and naval memoirs. It is fuU of brilliant adventures, which are described with a dash that well befits the deeds. We come into contact with one of the most ardent spirits that have ever engaged in any service, one to whom years have brought wfisdom without lessening his fire, and who, spite of the sadness induced by suffering and the earnestness which is natural to him, can afford to look back on much of his career with pleasure, and on some parts of it even with hu- mour. Let us add, not mentioning it as a real, but only as an artistic fault, that here and there Lord Dundonald has perhaps too much insisted on his ill fate and ilMusage. We cannot wonder at his doing so ; on the contrary, we sympathize with him. One of the most extraordinary facts in his career is that, notwithatanding his great genius, his mighty achievements, and the distinction to which he fought his way gallantly, it should be in the power of man or of circumstances to crush him, so that from the British service he was igno- miniously dismissed, while successively from the navies of Chili and Brazil he was unjustly dismissed. That this grand old captain should remember his wrongs with embittered feelings cannot be sur- prising; but now that his character has been amply vindicated, his rank recovered, his honours restored, and somne part of his losses, too, made good, he can afford to forget much that may not be forgiven, and to avoid the artistic error of too frequently turning a splendid autobiography into a lamentation of grievances.
			Our author devotes a considerable portion of his spaco to an account of the Cochrane family, but to most readers these genealogical details are not in- teresting. It is enough to say that the family is an ancient one, and the pedigree, like most Scotch pedigrees, a very long one. The peerage, however, only dates from tho time of Charles I., who con- ferred the Barony of Cochrane while he was a pri- soner in Carisbrook Castle, and of Charles Ir., who conferred the Earldom of Dundonald in 1669. Of all our hero's ancestors the one for whom people will care most is his father, who was a very remarkable man, and who, in transmitting to the son his own genius, hampered the gift with a pecuniary fatality. rhis father, the ninth Earl of Dundonald, was a man of original nifiald, and so versatile in his pur- suits that he renu.i. os or Sir William Petty, who seems to have eiga::ua in every known occupation, from shipbui!di, to land-surveying, from tailoring to music, and fi-'&amp;a the practico of physic to the invention of political arithmetic. Elis earlier years were spent in the navy,whie.h he learned thoroughly to hate. Hle then entered the army, but ere long quitted that also, turning his attention to science, the arts, and manufactures. These were the days of Cavendish and Priestley, Black and Watt; and Lord Dundonald, whose patri- mony had almost evaporated under a succes- sion of losses incurred in the support of one generation of Stuarts after another, conceived the idea of recovering his fortune by turning the dis- coveries of modern science to practical account. He accordingly embarked, without much acquaintance with the details of business, into numerous specula- tions, most of which, as far as he was concerned, proved to be failures. He prepared soda from salt as a substituto for barila, at that time the only alkali available for soaD and glass making. He set about the improvement of alumina as a mordant for silk and calico printers. Ile manufactured British gum to displace gum Senegal for tho use of calico printers. He had another manufactory for sal ammoniac. He had a new process for the production of white lead. En a sixth establishment he spent his energies on coal, from which he obtained coke for the ironfounders and tar for ships. In those days copper sheathing was almost unknown, and the chief defence against worms was to drive large-headed iron nails into the whole of the ship's bottom, which had thus the ap- pearance of being hob-nailed-a protection, how- ever, which was given only to superior vessels, the smaller ones being entirely at the mercy of the worm. Having observed whilo he was in theo navy the ravages made on ship's bottoms in this way, it occurred to Lord Dundonald, as a chymist, that an extract from pitcoal in the form of tar might be a preventive. Be made the experiment, was successful, saw his invention adopted by the Dutch, and more tardily in our own coasting craft; but could not prevail on the Admi- ralty, who about this time were beginning to t&gt;hink Of coppering, to second his views and give him its patronage. In his coal experiments he eliminated gas, and, conducting it through a gun barrel, pro- duced a flame which blazed forth in an unmistakablo manner; bat he did not turn this experience to further account. He passed on to new investiga-
			tions. In 1795 he published a Treatisc shotcing ile. irdfimateConnexionbetweenA gricunture and Chymi6*ry, in which he has made good his title to be regarded as the father of agricultural chymistry, and in which, to come to particulars, he has recommended three processes, for the authorship of which later writers have contended-the malting of grain for the food of cattle, the converting of peat moss into good soil, and the use of salt refuse in the way of manure, this last suggestion having been advanced by him at least 10 years before. It is impossible to enumerate all his schemes, and we shaU therefore only mention one more-an improved mode of preparing hemp and flax; for the manufacture of saileloth. So flimsy were the materials of which sails were com- posed, that our author says he has taken an observa. tion of the sun through the foretopsail, and brought it to a horizon through the foresail; and the Ad. miralty, seeing the advantages of the newv invention, ordained that in all their contracts hemp should be steeped and boiled after the manner explained in Lord Dundonald's patent. Unfortunately, all his Lordship's fertility of invention could not make his schemes successful from a pecuniary point of view. He had too many irons in the fire. His inventions fell into other hands; some were sold, others were pirated; and this ingenious, active, fertile thinker found himself, with soven children to provide for, aruined man.
			The eldest of these children is the present Earl of Dundonald2 the 10th of the name, who was born at Annsfield, m Lanarkshire, on the 14th of December, 1775. Born without a heritage, it appeared as if the boy must grow up without an education, but from this calamity he was spared by the kindness of his maternal grandmother. But his education was abruptly terminated by his being taken by hkis father to L^ondon, on the occason of the
			T*27ie ARtu,fiograp;1y of a Seaman. By Thonru, Tenth Earl of Dundoemli, Admiral of the Red, Bear Adiirl of tho Fleet, &amp;c. VoL L London, Bentloy.
			latter's going to press the advantages of coal tar upon the attention of the Admiralty. AUl the lad's inclination meanwhile was for the sea, and his uncle, who was a seaman, entered Lord Coch- rane's name,without the knowledge of his father, on the books of various vessels of which he was cap- tain. The old Earl, however, had different views. He was disgusted with t1l6 navy, and, intending his eldest son for the army, fiocured for him a commis- sion; so that Lord Cochrane was at once an officer in the 104th Regiment and a nominal seaman on board his uncle's ship. His father took the verybestmeans to confirm the young man's liking for the navy and distaste of the army. His hair was cut, was plastered back with candle-grease and flour, and was tortured into a queue. He had a stiff leather collar for his neck. He had a blue coat with red collar and cuffs, in imitation of the Windsor uniform, and, as a homage to Whig principles, he was com;- pelled to wear yellow waistcoat and breeches. Thus attired, the lad felt ridiculous, and he was mobbed by a set of ragaed urchins one day ashe was passing the Duke of lNorthumberland's palace at Charing- cross. Ho was flogged byhis father for objecting to such martyrdom, and was all the more confirmed in his determination to go to sea. At length, after six months of military education at Mr. Chanvet's academy, in Kensington-square, he was removed again to Scotland, wvhere, at the end of four years and a half of desultory self education he obtained his father's consent to join the navy. He left his homo with his father's gold watch as a keepsake-his only patrimony; and on the 27th of June, 1793, found himself, at the ripe age of 17A, midshipman on board his uncle's vessel the Hind, it Sheerness-a small frigate that carried 28 nine- pounders. He joined the navy at the right time. The war had just commenced, and great things were to be done-great glory achieved. ln point of efficiency the French navy was on a par with our own. In point of material, and especially of ships, it was superior, in proof of which we recall the fact that shortly afterwards the beat vessels in our fleets were those which we captured from the French. Lord Coebrane, when he was a prisoner in ar French line-of-battle ship, could not but admire the superior manner in which the sails were cut, so as to present to the wind a flat surface, very different from the bag reefs and bellying sails of English ships. Our dockyards had, indeed, very little to boast of at that time. The corruption in them was prodigious, and the dishonest workmanship frightfuL The frauds practised were so diabolical that whole ships' crews were destroyed at one fell swoop. If the French, however, beat us in their ships, we beat them in the crews with which the ships were manned. These, it is true, were the days of the pressgang, but impressment was seldom necessary when the commander of the vessel in commission inspired confidence. The sailors looked for prize-money, and any captain whose enterprise was likely to secure that blessing was sare of a numerous crew for t,he asking, a crew, too, of the best sailors in the world, and, what is more, of the best gunners. We were only a little before the French in seamanship, for these w ere days when France had colonies and had therefore a mission on the sea; but we were a long way before them in gunnery, and there lies the secret of our success.
			For 16 years from Lord Cochrane's introduc- tion to the service he was incessantly en- gaged in active duties, he himself often making the work where none was given to him. The preseat volume is the record of these 16 years of brilliant adventure, in which with smaller means he probably accomplished more than any other officer in our naval service. We should be happy if we could afford to narrate in the historical order what our hero accomplished with the means at his disposal, but we must be content to seize upon a few salient points, giving the reader general impressions, rather than a detailed account. To understand, however, what follows, we may in a few sentences give a mere catalogue of the ships to which he was gazetted, and the cruises in which he was engaged, beginning with that of the Hind, which was sent to hunt out French privateers that were supposed to be lurking on the coast of Norway, as well as to look out for an enemy's convoy, which was expected from the West Indies by the northern route round the Orkneys. On returning from this cruiso he went with his uncle to a more powerful frigate, the Thetis, the destination of which was North America. But while acting in the subordinate capacity, first of midshipman and then of lieutenant, he had no opportunities of distinction, and saw little or no fighting. Hfe passed from one ship to another, from the Thetis to the Africa, from the Africa to the L,ynx, from the Lynx back again to the Thetis, and froma the Thetis to the Resolution, the flagship, of which hle was appointed lieutenant on the 21st of June, 1797 ; but he smelt very little powder until, towards the close of 1798, he went as a supernumerary with Lord Keith, who was ap- pointed to relieve Lord St. Vincent in the command of the Mediterranean fleet. Even in the Mediter- ranean, however, for a time, tho energies of the fleet were paralyzed, owing to the double command which was created by Lord St.Vincent not at once taking his departure. Lord Keith went on a useless ch.sA of
			the enemy from the Mediterranean to Torbav, and back again from Torbay to uhe Mlediterranean, where in his absence Nelson had been doing good service at Naples. It was on the occasion of this fruitless expedition that Lord Cochrane uttered some indiscreet criticisms on Lord St. Vincent, which were afterwards remembered against him, and to which he attributes much of his ill success at the Admiralty. It wasnottillhe was appointed, in the spring of 1800, to the Speedy, a smaU vessel of only 158 tons burden, that he acquired any great distinction. With this little boat he did wonders. In 13 months he captured 50 vessels, 122 guns, and 534 prisoners, one of his prizes being the Gamo frigate, to which we shaU afterwards have to refer. The littlo Speedy. with her crew of 84 men and six officers, was the envy of the fleet for the amount of her gains. In July, 1801, how- ever, she had the misfortune to be captured by three French line-of-battle shlps, and in the follow- ing month, after Lord Cochrane was exchanged, he was promoted to the rank of post captain. Return- ing home, he felt the deficiencies of his education, and went to study at the Edinburgh University, where he particularly specifies Lord Palmerston among tho number of his fellow-students. It was the peacc of Amiens that gave him the chance of thus improving himself on shore, and on the recur- rence of war he Immedistely sought for employment afloat. He was appointed to the Arab, a collicr turned into a man-of-war. He could do nothing with her, and his connexion with her was a punishment-not an honour. When Lord St. Vincent left the Admiralty and was succeeded by Lord MlelviUe, our hero had once more a chance, for he was appointed to the Pallas, a new fir-built frigate of 32 guns, and was permitted to cruise for a month off the Azores. On this occasion he had to impress a crew-his condem- nation to command the Arab having made the sailors afraid to serve under a captain who was liable to such il-treatment. They were more than satisfied, however, with the results of their cruise, in which they made a splendid seizure of Spanish galleons. After this the Palas had to tako charge of a convoy to Quebec, and on returning from that duty was sent to the western coast of Frar:n3 with Admiral Thornborough's squadron, where Lord Cochrane performed some brilliant services. At the termination of his cruise he was elected M.P. for Honiton, and in the following month was despatehed in the frigate Imp6rieuse to his old station on the coast of La Vendee and Charente. fHe again returned to England, and this time to be elected, in the spring of 1807, for Westminster, at the head of the poll. In politics he was a Radical, and electioneering agents declare that always the most popular candi- date is a Radical who is a lord. Lord Cochrane at once brought his Radicalism into play, and at- tacked in the House of Commons the abuses of the navy so vigorously that he was ordered off to the Mediterranean to serve under Lord Coolingwvood. Here he displayed incomparable activity, keeping the whole coast of Spain in terror of him for nearly two years, and paralyzing the move- ments of considerable bodies of troops. He performed surh exploits with means so ridiculously small that on returning to England he was asked by Lord Mulgrave, then at the head of the Admiralty, to suggest a scheme for the destruction of the French fleet stationed at the mnouth of the Charente. He suggested a scheme, in which fireships and exploding vessels formed the prin- cipal featulre, and was appointed to execute it under Lord Gambier, the A dmiral on the station. Howv he had to encounter the jealousy of his brother captains and the backwardness of Lord Garuber; how, in spite of every difficulty, he ac- complished his own task with such perfect success that, had the blow which he struck been followed
			up by only one or two frigates beloncing to the British fleet, the -result would have been total destruction to tho French force; how, as it was, he destroyed several of the French ships, and broke up their plans ;-all this is fally described inthe con- cluling chapters of the present volume. Napoleon's criticism on the transaction was that if Lord Coch- rane had been properly supported he would have destroyed the whrle of the French ships, or rather he would have carried them off. And Lord Coch- rane's dissatisfaction at the way in which he had been tre'.ted was so strong that it ended in a court-martial on Lord Gambier, but the only result of the court- martial was to make Lord Cochrane more than ever disliked by men in office, and to make him feel that in the British navy he was in a nest of hornets. His achievements were a curse to him, and his claims to distinction were a ground of offence.
			What most of aU strikes us in contemplating the career of this great man is his fertility of resource. We begin even to forget his bravery in adniiring his genius. No man could be braver than he, butmany could be named equally brave. It would be diffi- cult, however, to name any seaman who has dis- played such an extraordinary ingenuity, and who, with trifling means, has effected so much. Lord Collingwood, under whom he served in the MIediter- ranean, remarked of him, IIHis resources for every exigency have no end." In a moment he struck out a scheme, or, having foreseen a difficulty, he had the scheme in readiness for it. Nothing escaped his vigilance, nothing baffled his contrivance. His success in the capture of prizes was due in a great measure to his ingenuity. WThereas other cruisers made their search along the shore by day, going out to sea by night, Lord Cochrane pursued the opposite course. It was at night he knew that the enemy would sail from poinAtfo point along the coast, being content by day to remain in some harbour or under the shelter of some battery. Accordingly he scoured along the coastby night, and kept out of sight by day. The same ingenuity helped him inmanya strait. He had the Speedy, for instance, painted in imitation of a Danish brig wfell know n on the Spanish coast, and wrhen he once fell into the powrer of a Spanish frigate superior in force to himself, he got out of the scrape by hoisting Danish colours. The Spaniard, not satisfied, sent a boat to examine his papers, and he averted that danger by running up the quaran- tine flag at the fore, calculating on the Spanish horror of the plague, which was then raging along the Barbary coast. The trick was per- feetly successful; and on another occasion he was equally fortunate in evading three French line-of-battle ships which were in chaso of the Pallas. Unable to escape by superior sailing, the order was given to haul dowrn every sail at the same instant. The mancmvre was executed with great precision, the helm was put hard a-weather, so as to wear the ship as speedily as possible, thePallas was suddenly brought up, and the pursuers, being quite unprepared for these tactics, shot past at full speed, and ran on several miles before they could shorten sail or trim on the opposite tack. The Pallas spread all sail on the opposite tack and got away, the success of this desperate expedient seeming to de- pend on the fact that there was a haze upon the sea withaclearsky, themastheads of theshipsbeingalone visible above the haze. In the samo vesselhe played another trick to deceive the enemy. He was short of hands, having despatched a good portion of his crew on a special service, and in this plight saw three French corvettes bearing down upon him. In order to make a show of strength he set the few hands he had to fasten the furled sails with rope yarns, the object being to cut the yarns all at once, let fal tho sails, and thus impress the enemy v;ith an idea that from such celerity in making sail the Pallas had a numerous and higbly diseiplined crew. He succeeded as usuaL No sooner was the cloud of canvass let fall than the vessels which were bearing down upon him ran off along shore, the Pallas in pursuit, til one after another they were driven aground and rendered useless. It was in the Pallas that Lord Dundonald invented a great kite, which he imagined would be useful in assisting the progress of his vessel. It did not suc- ceed, but he seems to think that the principle of his invention is quite correct and worthy of further trial. At the same time he emrployed kites for other purposes-namely, to scatter printed proclamations along the French coast. He used a great number of small kites in this way, a match being appended to the string in such a manner, that by tho time the kite had flown over the land, the strinzg was burned through. The proclamations were widely distributed by these means. So, again, when cruising on the southera coast of France, ho landed and burnt the French semaphores. But he did it in such avway that though he carried off the book of siguals, he left the impression that this precious book also was
			uurlieu. iue resuis was snas no cnlange was made in the signals, and when theFrench semaphores were re-established, Lord Colingawood had the satisfaction of learning from French authority aU the movements of the enemy as well as of the British ships from the promontory of Italy northwards. These, it will be observed, are nautical devices ; but, perhaps, the landsman will be more able to appreciate one of Lord Cochrane's manceuvres as a candidate for a seat in Parliament. He offered himself for Honiton; but, refusing to bribe, was unsuccessful. What did he do? On the announcement of his de- feat he immediately sent round the bellman to say that every man who voted for Lord Cochrane, the defeated candidate, would receive a present of 10 guineas as a testimony of his respect for him in being willing to vote without a bribe! Now, as the price which the successful candidate paid for the votes was only five guineas each, it was evident that the partisans of Lord Cochrane fared better than the opposition. The defeated candidate became the popular favourite, and he carried the next election with the greatest ease.
			Lord Cochrane's fertility of invention was but the finest phase of a general activity of character. He was always working,, and he worked at everything. On the coast of Chili, we learn from the volumes published by our author about a year ago, that the noble Eeaman, who in these latitudes went by the name of El Diablo, had to act in his ship as Admiral, Captain, and Lieu- tenant all at once, even taking his turn at the watch Afore than this, he turned ship carpenter and ship smith, mending the pumps with his own hands With his restless nature he could never be still while anything remained to be done; and his cruise in the Imperiense is a splendid proof of what may be accomplished by small means used with energy. He has stated, indeed, that though actions between line-of-battle ships are, no doubt, very imposing, he would prefer, for real effect, a score os two of small vessels, well handled, to any fleet of line-of-battle ships. All his great ex- ploits were performed in small vessels and against overwhelming odds. It is with a just pride that Lord Cochrane quotes Sir Walter Scott'e account of what he achieved in not only pre- venting any more troops from being sent into Spain, but in exciting such dismay that 2,000 men were withdrawn from Figueras to oppose him, when otherwise they wonld have been march- ing farther into the Peninsula. It is almost need- les to add that the coasting trade was entirely sus- pended during this alarm; but the crowning glory of the exploit is that it was achieved-such was Lord Coc'rane's care-without one man being killed, and with only one man hurt-that fsto say, he was singed In the blowing up of a battery. "The reward which our hero obtained for his services was in the form of a reproach that he had expended more sails, stores, gunpowder, and shot than had been used by any other captain in the service. It was in regard to such savings, even at the expense of energetic ser- vice, that the Admiralty hoped to compensate for the giganticpeculation which they were unableor un- willing to prevent. On the contrary, it is Lord Din- donald's deliberate opinion that had there been on t.he Atlantic coast of France such an expenditure of sails, gunpowder, and shot as he indulged in upon the M1editerranean coast, it would have rendered it impossible for the French to send an army to Western Spain, and we might hare been -aved the expense of the Peninmlar war. Con- sidering the number of armies which Napoleon was able to throw into Spain at once, this statement appears to be startling enough, but coming from such a man it is worthy of consideration. We repeat it. He maintains that three or foar ships doing on the western what he alone did on the southern coast of France, spreading terror along the shore, would have rendered the sending of an army into WVestem Spain an impossibility. He says that, had he been aUowed to operate in the Bay of Bis- cay with a small quadron, and to take posses- sion, as he wished, of the Firench islands-"I do not hesitate to stake my professional repu- tation that neither the Peninsular war, nor its enormous cost to the nation, from 1809 onwards, would ever have beon heard of." He maintains also that in case of futurc wars, it will alwavas be
			easy so to harass the French coast as to find ful employment for the French army at home, and to render the invasion of foreign countries an impossi- bility. Ta obtain such a result, hoxwever, w,e re- quire Adnmira]s like Lord Cochrane, endowvedsvith sleepless vigilance and superhuman activity.
			All the great qualities for which Lord Dcmdonald is distinguished, but especially his ingenuity, his bravery, and his sense- of humour, appeared in his encounter 'with the Gamo. It must be remembered that he commanded the Speedy, a very small vessel of 158 tons, armed with 14 gnns, which were only four-pounders. The armament was so small that, by way of burlesquing such an equipment, Lord Cochrane one day walked the quarter-deck with a whole broadside of shot in his coat pockets. His cabin was so small that there was not room even for a chair, and the only way in which the captain could shave of a morning was by removing the skylight and putting his head through to make a toilet table of the quarter-deck. Into this tiny cockboat 84 men and six officews were crowded, and they took prizes without end. NYe have already explained how in this vessel he managed to escape from a forrmidable Spanish frigate by hoisting Danish colours and then the quarantine flag. Mlost men wvould have been pleased, but Lord Coebrane seems to have been so disBatisfied with himself for not having tackled the frigate boldly that when ho came across the Gamo he determined to make up for lat time, although thatfrigate had 32 heavygmnsand3l.9men, wbile his own crew had been reduced, through the no- cessityof attendina tothe prizes, to 54 men,including officers andboys. He ran his little vessel vithout firing a gun right under the lee of the frigate, locking the yards of the Speedy in the rigging of her enemy. The consequence of this arrangement wa&amp;S that, from the height of the frigate out of vater, the whole of her shot wvent over the heads of the English crevw, whose gans being elevated blow up the main- deck of the Gamo. The Spaniards were fighting at such a disadvantage that they gave the order to board the Speedy, who prevented the execution of such a movement by sheering off at the right moment, and then returning to the charue. Finally, Lord Cochrane determined to board the Game. He set his surgeon, Mlr. Guthrle, to tal:e the helm of the Speedy, left hit' alone in the little vessel as at once commander and crew. while he hbself and all his men rtushed into the frigate. In an hour and a half the Gamo was in the possession of the little Speedy, which it bad regarded as a too easy prey. The loss of the conqueror was a total of three seamen lilled, ono officer and seventeen men wounded. That of the vanquished was the captain, the boatswain, and thirteen seamen killed, together with forty-one wounded, her casualties being thus in excess of thV whole number of officers and crew of the Speedy. The story of this brilliant exploit would be incoin- plete if we did not add that the officerv who suc- ceeded to the command of the Gamo aDplied to Lord Cochrane for a certificate that he had coneo-is duty during the action. With a sly humour which ap- pears in several of the incidents we have already related, Lord Cochrane gave him a certificate worded as follows :-" Don - has conducted Idta
			selt like a true Spanisrd." With this document he was highly pleased, and Lord Cochrane had tho satisfaction of learning that it procured him further promotion in the Spanish service.
			Why qualities so brilliant, and exploits so gloriouss should not have carried the author to worldly success and professional rank, we find ourselves unablo to explain. That there was much in Lord Cochrane's character to retard success and to disgust official men is perfectly plain lHe spoke his opinions with a freedom which wasnot always pleasant. He was a Radical in politics, he had a good opinion of his own merits, and no con- sideration on earth could induce him to tolerate in- difference to himself or injustice to othors. Forming a just estimate of his own powers, and feeling his own superiority to the men around him, the idea that his claims were slighted while those of meaner men were recognized made the blood within him boil, and he probably resented the treatment he received with indiscretion. Not alone for himself, hut also for his friends, he fought with an indiscretion which, in official eyes, is almost unpardonable. He good-naturedly wrote letters urging the claims of his lieutenant, Parker, who had gaUantly seconded his efforts in the capture of the Gamo, when he might have seen that his perti- nacity in worrying the Board of Admiralty was not only doing an injury to himself, but also could do no good to the man he was most anxions to benefit. Lord Cochrane was not of that claEs of men who take things calmly and are content, through good vnd evil report, to bide their time without repining. He stood upon his rights, and he could not see why right should ever be overlooked, lie could not see that in the struggle for distinction many claims will betardilrecognized; young men wiUnowandthen be snubbed, and we must not expect that aUl the world wril form as high an estimate of onr abilities as we could wish. When Lord Dundonald says to those who may think his conduct towards the First Lord and the Board of Admiralty disrespectful, "II can only say that were my life to begin anew with my present experience of consequences, I woulld again pursue the same course," our mouths are, of course, shut. Lord Dundonald's "experience of conse- quences " is that he did not attain his end, and that he only succeeded in making power- ful enemies to himself. Alnd yet he would do the same thing over again; he would, with a full knowledge of w.hat he was doing, run his head against a dead walL. Feeling at the close of his life that what he did was so imperative, wo can easily believe that at the time of his doing it he threw into his behaviour, into his private conversa tions and personal encounters, even a greater amount of energy and animus than appears in his written communications, and that this must -account for a great deal of the hostility with which fate pursued him throughout life. Mlaking every allowance, however, for the indiscretions of a man who took a strong Radical viewr of poltics and of his profession, and who spoke out what Was in him without re- gard to time, or place, or persons, we are at a logs to account for the series of misfortunes which fol- lowed Lord Dundonald wherever he went; we feel that his greatuess ought to have silenced all opposi- tion and triumphed over every obstacle; and his career at present reads li-e a Greek tragedy, in which we find the hero unaccountably foiled by circumstance. A fate is upon him, and do what ho wiUhe cannot succeed. le may be the best of men, he may be the greatest of men, but he is not snasteD of his fate-a decree has gone forth, and everything turns against him, although he does everything well. If it is not in mortals to command success, Lord Dundonald is of the few to whom belongs the higher glory of having deserved it. How his misfortunes fell upon him one after another, until it Eeemed as if he must be overwhelmed, is a riddle unexplained. That Lord Dandonald should have passed through the fiery trial unscathed, and should now be named among us only with honour and ad- miration, is a poetical justice which we are delighted to see, but which we do not often find in this prosaic world.

			L,E=mtE lBY M. LOUIS A3LAN.-M. Louis Blanc delivered a lecture on Tuesday night in Englsh on " Tha Mysterious Personages and Agencies in France towards tho end of the Eighteenth Century," at the Eyre Arms Assem- bly Rooms, St. John's-wood. The lecturer began by pointing out that the love of tho marvellons prevailed in France during tho age of rationalism, and entered into details respecting the suocessful impostures of the Count St. Germain, who pretended, among other things, that ho had lived many hundred years, hiad been on Intimate terms with Francis I., and received delicat
			commissions from Henry VIIL and the Emperor Charles V. Yet people believed In bim, focked to him, conrted him. Madame do Pompadour wus one of bin devotees, Louis XV. Invited him to Verpailles, and even 'ho sceptical Voltaire declared that he knew everything. Tho lecturer next touched upon tho marvels of Mesmer, giving a picturesque account of the scenes that occurred at his house in Parls, to which persons affected with a3 kinds of diseases flocked by thousands, to be cured by the magic fluid. The second part of the lecture was almost entirely occupled by a graphtc sketch of tho career of Cagleostro, and of the sur- prising effect his pretended powers exercised in Franee. i, LouisBlanc did not agree, ho said, with the judgment passed upon this remarkable man by Mr. Cnrlylc. Hle was somethWng more than a low swindler and common cheat. Ho was a deceiver, certaWy, and for that deserved to be branded; but he had n higher aim than that of merely dazzUng the vulgar ; he wished to disseminzte the doctrinn of the Illuminati, that strange society, epringing out of masonry and having for its ultimato objects the overthrow of 1 esultism and the improvemcnt of the human race.

			-~ - LAW REPORT.
			COURT OF PROBATE AIM DIVORCE. APPTr 4.
			-- --" - 3ffmitS V. MIL"S
			(Before Sir 0. CREsswLL.)
			- --bUU oy a wale for judlcial separatton on the ground of adultery came before the Court upon the ques- tion of alimony pendente lite on Wednesday last.
			Mr. Mundell argued the case for the petitioner; Mr. H.
			M!acaulay, Q.C., and Dr. Spinks for the respondent. I
			His LORDSmIP, having taken time to consider, now said it was very difficult to come to anything like a correct con- clusion upon questions of this sort; but, as nearly as he could make it out, the husband's income was about 2,3001. The sound rule in awarding alimony had been heldi to be 'hat, whatever might be tho alleged conduct of the wife, sbe was entitled to alimony pendcnte Zile suitable to her con- ditlon in Ufe and proportionate to the husband'smeans. It 'Was argued that, as the husband after the marriage had pre- zented the petitioner with a very large sum of money, she ought to have an income of her own, and therefore was not ntltledto alimonypendewec litUe. But she stated,and there was no evidence that her account was not a true one, that this property had been invested in Austrian securities, and, from the changes which had taken place from time to time in their value, it was reduced to about 4,0001. He thonght he could not, under these circumstances, take into considera- tion the sum which the petitioner received after her mar- riage. If she had spent it after the suit commenced, or made away with it in anticipation of the suit,he should have dealt with her as if It had remained in her possession; bht, that not being the case alihe had to consider was,what was the state of things at the commencement of the suit. He should therefore deal with her as a person with an income of 30CZ. a-year. it had also been argued that as she was living In Anstria, where she required a smaUer income for her maintenance than if she lived in England, the Court ought not to award alimony upon the same scale as in other cases. But it would be very diffictlt to take matters of that kind into consideration in dealing with questions of alimony. kThe usual rule must be followed, and he shoild award to the petitioner alimony pendente tlte to the extent ef 2001. n-year. in addition to her own SOOZ

			A iecrce ot jdicial separation had been prononnced in this case at the pnyer of the wrife, pon the ground of the hlmsband s cruelty The acts of cmdely appeared, however, to have been commlitted under the in'duence of great escitee- ment, brought on by over exert on and iety in business and his Lordship observed in the course of the case that less mnoral blame attached to the husband than in any other case of cruelty that h_d been before the Court. There wero three children of the marriage, a boy and two girls, of tho zeepective ages of four years, two years, and four montbs.
			]r. Spinks, on cadnesday last, moved on the part OF the petitioner for the custodly of the childIren. The motion was opposed by Dr. PhUilimoro, Q. C., for the hus- band, and the Cour took time for consideration.
			His LORDSisP now said that, although the anxiety and care of thg respondent in the conduct of his business had made him so fretful and hasty that his wife could not live with him without danger, there was nothing in the evidence to show thab he had ever treated the children otherwiso than with kindncss. He was now living with his mother, who offered to take charge of the children. The Court would %nder these circumstances, order that he should have th custody of the eldest child. The two others were very young, and they had better remain with their mother. The usaul arrangements would bo made for mutual access.

			CENTPAL cRIAILNAL COURT, Aprit 4.
			OLD COURT.
			TE QLEEEN, ON TOZ r.tuSE=TIOq OF THOWAS HODGES,
			V. WILLIAMt COX AND OTHES.
			eBefrf eM r. JUStIe WIlLIAMS and Mr. Baron CLAYNLL.)
			3erjeant BALLAweINE, who was retained specially rith tr. Poland, in this case, on behalf of tho defendants, made an application to the Court to postpone the trial to the next
			ession . The charge arose out of an Inquiry that took place before Mr. Traill, the magistrate of the Greenwich police- court', as to the loss of a vessel caUed the John Suars, and all the defendants were examined, and the inqniiry esulted in the certificate of the captain, who was the present pro- secutor, being suspended by the Board of Trade for 12 months. At the last session a bill was preferred, and found by the grand jury, charging Cox and the other defendants with conspiring together to make a false charge against the
			rosecutor, an3d at the present session five other bills had en found against the same defendants for perjury. These bills, he said, were only found late en the previous evening, and he and hislearned friendhad net had anyopportunityof readlng the depositions, or of making themseves acquainted with the nature of the charges that were to be preferred Under these circumstiances bis application was that the trial should be postponed to the next session, and he believed his learned friend, the Solictor-General, felt that his applica- tion was a reasonable one, and would not offer any opposi- tion to it.
			The SOLiCrrOR-GssEnAL said that ha left the matter On- tirelyJn the hands of the Court.
			Mr. Justice WILLLsaOS then directed that the trial shonld be postponed, and the recognizances of the witnesses were respited to the next session.
			Mr. CooPER also made an application to postpone the trial of a young girl named EugeniaPlummer against whom an indictment for perjury had been preferred by the Eev.
			r. Efatch, which had been returned a truO bill by the grand jury, to the nexct session. Ho said that in the ordi- nary courso a Bench warrant would be issued for the appre- hension of the child in question, and her parents were anxious to prevent the annoyance that must necessarily arise from such a procceding, and her father was in attend- ance ready to enter into recognizcnces to any amount for the appearance of his daughter at the next session. Thelearned counsel added that the parents of the child, and she herself also, were most anxious to meet tho charge, but they, of course, could not be ready at tho present session.
			Mr. Baron CrANN.SELL inquired whether any gentleman wa instructed to prosecute.
			Mr. CooPER said he believed not at present.
			The CorRT expressed an opinion that the applicatien *was a reasonable one, but thoy would not decide upon it until they know whether any learned counsel had been re- tained on behalf of the prosecution, and ho had an oppor- tunity of answering the application.
			Maximilian Gutkind. a German, who was remanded from last session upon a charge of feloniously neglecting and emitting to surrender and paso his examination at the Court oE Bankruptey, after having been duly adjudicated a bank- rupt, was cailed upon to surrender and take his trial upon that charge.
			The defendant did not auewer, and the CorRT gave direc- tions that the recognizances of himself and his bail should beo eatreated.
			MIr. SLEIGII mado an application on behalf of the bail that the recognizances might not bo returned to the Court of Exchequer until the next scssion, in order to afford them an opportunity of securing the defendant, which they hoped to bo aSle to do during the interval.
			Mr. Serjeant BALL.rNTINe, who was retained to conduct the prosecution, said that the trial of this defendant was postponed from the last session, on account of his claiming to be tried by a partly foreign jury. Nothing was then said nbout his being admitted to bail, but it appeared that since the session an aDplication had been made to MTr. Justice Crompton that he should be admitted to bail, which was acceded to by that learned judge, and the prisoner imme- diately upon obtaining his liberty took the course that might have teen expected, and had left the country. His fear was that if the present application was granted thebail might 'adopt theo same course, and thus the ends of juastice would be entirely frustrated.
			hfr. SLrgcos assured the Court that there was no fear that this would be the case, as the ball were most anxious to secure the prisoner, and their lordships ultimately con- rented to a7aw the recognizances to stand over to the next sewsson.
			Thomas Welldon, 2S, grocer, was char'ed with feloniously omitting,to surrender after having been declared a bankrupt. }le was also charged with misdemeanour in having fraudu- lently obtained goods, within three months of lis being declared bankernpt, nuder the false colour and pretence of carrying on his trade, with intent to defraud his creditors.
			The prisoner pleaded "Gullty'" to the last-mentioned charge.
			Serje.ant ?ARR'I, who appeared for the prosecution, said tba2 to rboerhaving pleaded guilty to the charge of mlsumeaour,he ld ot tlukitneces.sary to proceed with tho felony, and he should therefore not offer any evidence in support of that charge.
			entenco was deferred.
			SydneyDyer, a diminutiveclooking lad, who was stated n the caienda. to bo 15 years old. was charged with forging and uttering a check for 121?., with intent to defraud the City Bank.
			Mfr. Orridgo conducted the prosecution.
			The prisoner, it appeared, was formerly In the servlce of Mr. Wright, an arecitect and surveyor in King-street, Cheapside, as offico hoy, and be thus became aware that be Reot an account at the City Bank, and was also acquainted with his handwriting. On the 15th of February an order for a checkbook, apparently signed by Mr. Wright, was presented at the bank by a lad, and one was handed
			to him by the clerk. On the same day a cheek for I 121f., purporting to be signed by Mr. Wright, was presented to tho caslier, and it was rather a sin. galar circumstanco tbat, although thls gentleman ex. pressed his opinion tha tef sintature did not resemble his aenuino signature, and the body oF tho check was filled up in a mannertotally different to his own mode of filling them up, the cheek wss paid in 24 6Z.-notes, and 4r. in geod. A fove dys after this it appeared that the prisoner went to tho shop of Mr. Lincoln, a dealer in old coihs and other curiosities tn the Blackfaire-road, and purchased coins to the amount of about 2?., which ho took away with him, and on the following day ho went again to the same shop and purchased other coins to a con- sidlerable amount. This proceeding excited some sus- picion in the mind of lFr. Lincoln, who asked the pri- soner wbero he lived, and whether his parents were aware of his purchasing the coins. Ho replied that they were, and that his father was very pleased that he took an interest in the study of old coins, and that ho was also so pleasedwith the purchase he had made on the previoas day thal. ho had Eent
			him to make another and arrger pturchase. Mr. Lincoln -was not eatissied-witk this very ingenious tale, aiid he in- sisted upon accompanying the prisoner to his parents to see if it was true, and they started together to Wood-green, where he said his parents lived, and, after driving about until 2 o'clock in the morning without the pri- n soner being able, as he said, to find his home they returned to London, and on the following morning t'ho pri- sonter wa given Into the custody of Inspector Moore, of the f division of police. It was then ascertoined that the pri- soner lived with his mother, in Nelson-street, City-road, and on his being searched 70 soverei um wa found in his possesson, and at his mother's house were found the coins that he had purchased on the previous day. The check- book that bad been issuel upon the forged order, and two other forged checks in the name of Mr. Wright,--one for 3761., andt~'he other for 3761. 10s.,-were likewise fouLnd in thoe poseslion of the prisoner.
			When the prisoner woa caled upon for his defence he said there was no prooe that he was at the bank, and he found all the money that was taken from him by the officer, tied up in a handkerchief in Finsbury-squsare.
			Mr. Justice WILLOAs1S having briefly summed up, The jury at once retuned a verdict of Gnoilty.
			A certificate was tbek put in, by which it appeared that the rlsoner wa summarily convict-ed in January, lStb , at Clerkenwell police-court, of stealing two watches, the pro- perty of his master, and was sentenced to psx months' imprisonment and hard labour.
			The learned Juboa observed that It was a vepy dreadftl case, and he really did not know what to do with such a lad asithe prisoner. He then ordered him to stand down, and said he woutld consider what sentence should be pronounced.
			Frederick Jolh Fsncb, 23, wee charged with stealing three lettrs, containing money, the Droperty of the Post- maaster-General.
			Mr. Clerk and or. Metcalfe conducted the prosecution the prisoner had no counsel.
			It appeared that the prisnner was In the employ of the Post-otfcee as sorter and letter-carrier, and he was engaged in tho former capacity at the General Post-otffce on the afternoon of the 24th of Mtarch. In consequence of some suspicion that appeared to be entertained of the prisoner, he was watched, and wan seen to look at several letters In a very suspicious manner, and at length he put three letters on one side, and placed his handlkerehief over them, and he then contrived to get them inteo ds pocket. Hse was at once sent for into a private room, the letters were found in his possesion, and he then said it was the firct time ho had done anything wrong.
			The prsoner put in a very ingenious written vtatementto the effect that the letters in question were mis-sorted, and his object in takin" them away was to place them in the proper distrieb for alveray.
			The jury, after some deliberation, returend a verlict of Guilty.
			John Darby, 14, pleaded " Guilty" bo a similar charge.
			Mr. CLto be informed the Court that in this ease the pri- soner was not actually in the service of tha Pest-office, but he wan employed as an errand-boy in the service of a Mr. Young, who kept a recSiving-bouse for letters, and he had somewhat culpably allowed the prisoner to assist in the post-office business, It being conrary to the positive regula- tions of the Post-office tdat any one under the age of 16 should be allowed to deal with post letters.
			The learned J GonE then sentenced the prisoner Finch to he kepgt Ina peral servitude for four yeara, and the lad Deb y to ha imprisoned and kept to hard labon r for eix months.
			Charles Fox, 21. waS charged withforgiv g and uttering an order for 131. is. 6d.
			Mr. l tompson prosecuted; the prisoner wan defended b y Mr. Arm
			It appeae that the prisoner had been lodging at the D.uke'sHead public-house, rsear Groevenor-square, and he had Incurred a debt of 31. 12s. 2d. The landlord was press- ing him for the amount, and he said that he expected some money ini a fewv das, and be would then pay him. On the
			do February a letter addressed to the prisoner arriveo
			at the Dnke'm Head, vhich he opened, and took ont what appered to he a post-offie order for 13e. Is. 6d. fhe made various excuses for not getting the order paid, and at length he gave the order to Mr. Mitchell, the landlord of the Duke's Head, toisresnt, audi th en turned out that the order had
			benorgiall grate for Is. Gd. only and that words and ueswere Tnqniadded toak s appeatat was a genuine post-office order for 131, is. Gd.
			The jmry found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to onhe ya's imprisonment and hard laboaur.
			Augustus Robert Seymour, aZias Zemer, a German, was charged with forging an endorsement to a bi of exchange for 401., with intent to defrsnd.
			Mr. Sleigh and Mr. Poland conductede s prosecution on behalf of the Bankers' Association.
			The facts of this can have appeared very recently in the police reports. The endorsement alleged to have beeU forged was that of a gentleman n-amedl Reed, -who had returned to this couLntry from Australmia n the Royal Charter, and lost hie life upon the occasion of the wreck of that pl-fated vessel, on the 26rh of October last. Among the effeccs of the deceased wan a bhl for 401., drawn by the Bank of Australasia upon their agents in this country. This bill by some means or other got into the possession of the prisoner, who keeps a watchmaker's shop at Beaumauris, In which neighbourhood, It will be remem- bered, the unfortunate vessel was wrecked, and he after- wards obtained discount for the bill, which at that time purprte to eartheendoeemnt f the unfortunate deceasod.

			2NEW COURT.
			(Before jlMr. Baron COIANTELL.)
			Willam Staplee and George Chesterfield surrendered to faere by thea cityo autboriSntes, inewhich they were charged
			and unfit for food, with intent to expose It for sale.
			Mr. leig prcecued; r. erjer.tParry defendedl Staplee, and MWr. T. Atkinson srdefSenrdied rCh Pre3terfield.
			These, which occupiedthe Couttt nearly all day, was this :-On th 6ho eebrMr. W. E. Taylor, a sales-
			man in Newgate-markcet, received a hamper of meat con- signed to him from the defendant Staplee, of Croylaud, icn. colshire, for sale. Upon the hampsr being opened, Mr. Taylor found It to contain three quarters of cow beef, and part of the fourth quarter, weighing In all about 5001b., in a state unfit for food. Mr. Taylor immediately gave in- formation to Russell, the officer, and to the beadle of the market, Kentish, and they at once took possession of the meat, which was subsequently inspected by Mfr. Fisher, who condemned it, and directed it to be destroyed. Mr. Taylor had not previously to this had any transactions with Staplee, bu' had with the other defendant, who is a butcher at Croy- land. An inquiry was then set on foot by the city authori- ties, and they found that Staplee was a farmer at Croyland, and had the management of bis brother's farm. While the inquiry was going on a letter came up from Croyland, from a Mr. Hands, a barber, residing near to the slaughterhouse of the derendant Chesterfield, in which ho stated that he had scan a dead cow sent from Chesterfield's slaughterhouse, after being dressed there, and that it was in a diseased slate. Mr. Harker, the sanitary inspect-er of Croyland, then ascertained that on the 23d of
			December the cowv was found dead upon Mtr. Staplee's form, haing wstbeen taccientallysltdrasngDled. tIts thdroat wvas then cut, to London. Some of the witnesses said that the cow was in such a bad state that the smell while It was beingc dressed caused Chesterfield to be Ill for some time afterwards. The skin when taken off was gorged with blood and putrid matter.
			In cross-examination It was elicited that the cow was in milk up to the time of its being found dead.
			Mr. SerjeantPARsY, forthe defence, argned thattherebad been no intent on the part of his client that the meat should bo exposed for s3le if thought unfit for food. There had been much exaggeration about the state of the cow at the tuno of its being dressed, and, the weather being at the time warm, the meat had spoilt by being packed. Thu) defendant had sent the carcass up, tnot thinking it unfit for food, and relled upon the agent in London not to expose It for sale unless be thought it Sit for food.
			Mr. ATrsLNseN adopted tho same line of defence for his cIlient.
			His LORcI)sua having summed up, the jury retired, and were locked up until nearly 9 o'clockb, when they returned a verdict. of Guilty.-Sentence deferred.

			POLICE.
			LL&amp;Sio-r-uo7usm-Ann Brov,n was chargecl with stealing a pocketbook containing 19 sovereigns, from Robert Seaxle, a waiter living at Hackney.
			About 12 o'clock on Tuesday night the prosecutor met tho prisoner in Bishopsgate-street and stopped to have some talk with her, when she suddenly thrust one hand into his waist- coat pocket, from-which she abstracted 19s., and the other into the breast pocket of his coat, which was torn by the violencewith which she withdrew hispocketbook. She was running off, when a policeman turned a corner at the dis- tance of a few yards only, and she then pushed the pocket- book back into its plrce, bat dropped some gold on the pavement in doing so. The prosecutor clutcbed ker arm, but she broke away, and ag ho started to follow her he feU down into a heap of mud, and at the same time cut his face on the kerbstone. She was, however, secured by the police- man, who also picked up two sovereigns near the spot; so that, as 16 soveredgns were left in the pocketbook, the am ount lost by the prosecutor was only Lt. 19a., and as this was not found upon the prisoner, it was presumed she had given it to another woman who passed before the odieer secured her.
			Although the polSeeman as well as the prosecutor saw her retsirn the pocketbook into the pocket, the prisoner solemnly protested that she was as innocent as the babo unborn, but was, notwithstanding, committed for trial.
			Elizabeth Peck was brought up on remand, charged with forging the name of Emma Prebble, with intent to defraud.
			From the evidence adduced now and on a former occa- sion It transpired that Prebble somo three yeara ago formed an illicit connexion with a gentlemaan of good posi- tion, who soon afterwards quitted Eogland for India without making any provision for her, in consequence of which her confinement took place in tho workhouse. Sub- sequently she -went to lodge with the prisoner, to whom sbe related the circumatances which had led to her beimg in a destitute condition, and on whose suggestion it was resolved to apply for assistance to Prebble's seducer, who did not appear to be aware of her condition when he left this country. The prisoner accord- ingly wrote to the gentlenaninPrebble's name, acquainting him with the birth of a child, and asking for assistance, the result of which appeal appears to have been a quarterly re- mittanee of 161. by draught on the Oriental Bank, Thread- needle-street, payable to Prebble. Me.anwhile an arrange- ment had been come to between the two women that the prisoner should take care of the child while its mother went to service, and that she should be remunerated by receivSug one-half of the money whieh its father might send for its support; but the letters containing the remittances, being sent under cover to the prisoner, she opened them, and on several occasions kept back the letters themselves, cashed the draughts they enclosed at the Ori- ental Bank, having first forged Prebble's signature, and then told Preeble that they were for smaUer amounts than was realy the case. applying the balance to her own use, in addition to the money handed to her by Prebble as the "half'" which it had been arranged she should receive.
			The prisoner, in her ddeence, alleged that she had a general power from Prebble to conduct the correspondence and apply the money at her discretion for the benefit of the child; but this statement was altogether deniied by Prebble, who, on the other hand, charged the prisoner with forcibly detaning the child and endeavourlng to intimidate her (Prebble* by threats of writing, so as to seop the supplies from its father.

			WaMTaeSTEPt-On the 27th nlt. Lieutenant Windowe, adjutant of the London recrniting dlstrict, charged a man vwho gave his name James Walk-er with fraudulently confess. ing himself to be a deserter, and thereby, uponk committal. from tho Thames Police-court, obtaining his subsistencs, amounting to 11. 7s., in prison. The pro secoetion had been in- stituted by direction of the Secretary of State for War, end the evidence proved that the acoosed had enlisted in the 58th Regiment in 1857, and was discharged on the Gth of last February for bad conduct, after which he gave himself np at the Thames Police-court, and, having stated that during a temporary abseneo from the 58th he had re-enlisted Into the 5th Foslleors, and deserted a few months after- wards, was committed to prison upon his own confession.
			The prisoner haLving dleclared that be was a deserter freem the 5th Fusileers as he had stated at tho Thames Police- court, MIr. DA;^MAI expressed his opinion that there was notbkSg to sustain the c3arge as then shaped against the ac- cused, and suggested that evidence should be produced to suPport a prosecution for concealing tho fact at the time he re-enlisted Into the 5(h Fusileers Of his bein alrteady a sol- dier, and the prisoner was accordingly remanded until yes- terday.
			Lieutenant Windowe again appeared, and stated that ho entertainedl no douabt that the prisoner's representation of his being a deserter from the 5th was a fabrication to obtain subsistence, and, such being the case, it was not com- petent for him to procced as s6ggested. He now produced the muster-roll of the 2d battalion of the 5th Fusileers, to which the prisoner had'stated he bolonged, signed by the lIeutenant-colonel aud a justice of the peace, by which ib was sbown that no such name as that of the accused ap- peared In it, a fact clearly shown by the adjutant aud paymaster's report. He (Lleutenant Windowe) vwas there- fore prepared to prove that the prisoner never was in the 5th Fusileers, and that his representation that he had deserted from that regiment must consequently be fraudu-
			Mlr.D.WY1M, remarked that the prodactlon of the mustor roll did not prove that the accused had never been in the 5th Fuslleers, as he might have enlisted in another name. If he had deserted from the 5Sth and re-enlisted during his absence into the 5th it was not likely he would have done so in the same name.
			Lieatenant Windowe observed that the prisoner had been discharged from the 5Sth Regiment on the 6th of last February, and could not be a deserter, as he wao absolved from all engagements; his discharge would free him.
			Mr. DtYMA^ Paid that that did not show that he had never been a soldier in rnd deserted from the 5th.
			Lieutenant Windowe reaea letter from an officer in com- mand of the regiment, showing that a person named John Bstes,by which name the prisoner had passed, had previously to this given himself up as a deserter, but was discharged,as he was unknown in it. There was no doubt that the pri- soner had been making a trade of giving himself up as a deserter, and so obtaining a subsistence.
			31r. DAYMAN thought that might be so; but ho must have the necessary legal proof before he could act.
			Lieutenant Windowe remarked that the prisoner had said that he had enlisted in the 37th, and tho Government had been put to the expense of bringing a man from Belfast to see whether he could identify him; but when be came he knew nothing about the prisoner. He submitted that the prisoner had committed an offencemmader the 49th section of the Mutiny Act, in falsely confessing himself to be a de- serter from the 5th, as it was quite clear his statement was false.
			Mr. D.A.tlM observed that that was assuming the very point he had a great doubt about. The point was to show the prisoner had never beenin the 5th Fusileers. It might have been a most Improper and unlawful enlistment, as it was quite clear that the prisoner was a soldier in the 58th Regiment at the time, and therefore could-not possiblyserve in the 5th, but if he had re-enlisted into the latter during his absence from the 58th, and had then left it, it would be a desertion in tho ordinary acceptation of the term, and in enforcing a penal statute he could not strain the 49th section to make the prisoner's a fraudulent confession of de- sertion; he (Mr. Dayman) had understood Lieutenant Win- dowe to say he thouRht he should be able to produce evi- dence against the pilsoner under the section suggested.
			After some further conversation, in the course of which iAeutenant Windowe repeated his firm conviction that the p risoner had never been in the 5th, and therefore could not De charged with making any fa3se representation at the time of enlistment or attestation for that regiment.
			Prisoner eaid that if the Hue and Cry for 1857 were looked at It would be found that a full description was given of him as a deserter from the 5th. The sergeant who took him to the Thames Pollce-court acted upon what was in the Huc and Cry.
			Mr. Da smAx having stated that tosustain this charge ho must have somebody from the 2d battalion of the 5th who was at Belfast,where prisoner said ho enlisted, or Newcastle- on-Tyne,where he alleged hedeserted,to prove he wasnot in the regiment,
			Lieutenant Windowe said tha' tho authorities at the War-offics were determined to put a stop to ouch nefarious practices, and, whatever expense or trouble was incurred, he would produce the required evidence if the prisoner were remanded.
			The prisoner was accordinuly remanded for a week.

			WORSm=-STREET.-James Carter, an active yonng fellow, was charged with the foUowing robbery.
			The prisoner, who was recognized by Haynes, one of the warrant officers, as a well.known thief and practiser of the " inquiry dodge," as it is called by the police, met a poor woman named Davison, the wife of a jourreyman tailor at Homerton,atflo'clockyestesday morning stashortdistance from her home and, bowing to her politely, asked her if she would be good enough to tell him the shortest road to Bow. She pointed it out to him, and as sbe did so he leant towards her, as though 'ho understood her directlon with difficvlty, but suddenly affected to realize the idea, and hastened away at such a pace on to excite her sus- picions. She had no reason to believe she had been robbed, holt she pub her hand Into her pocket, and, finding her purse, with some sY:ver in it, and which won safe but a mo- menL beFore, was now gone, she began to lament her loss, and n labourer named Cuttver, on seeing her tribuIaton, and

			THEl LiVgcrPooL. COI r COr,RT.-For the laat two days the judges of the Liverpool County Court, Messrs. Blair and Hulton, have, with the assistance of the Treceurer been inves'Ugat the accounts of Mr. William Statham' the Registrar of the Court. ITp to the present time a de- ficiency to the ext-nt of 8001. has been dIscovered. Althongh the actual defalcation Is not likely, owing to the system of comipulsory perlodical payments, much to exceed 1,0001., the inquiry has brought to light a systiem of irregalaritles so flagrant thet it is impossible that the re- gistrar can retain his situation. The oft-recarring complaints of the suitors are now easily explained, and l is not un- likely that some of the inferior oificers of the court-those at least who were cognisant of the fact that money had been improperly kept baok-will also be compromised. There are other subordinates, who, having become surety and acoepted biUls, will suffer pecaunary loss, which in their position they are little able to bear. These facts cannot he kept back from the Lords of the Treasury, in whose hands rests the power of dismissal, and, ii we ore not mistaken, informatlon has alreadyvbeen forwarded to the Government on the subject. The Rcv. R. J. Statham of Tarporley, and Mr. Richard Bevan, wine merchant, are the sureties for the registrar, end they will, of course, bo responslble for the deficit. The saary of the registrar of the county oonrt is 7001., and with the fees arising from insolvency cases his incomo reaches about 1,0001. a-year.- Liserpooe MCI-curlv.

			SPP1-IG ASSIZES.
			- OXFORD CIRUIT.
			GLOOESTER, AaRI 4.
			ICVM COURT.-(Before Mr. Baron B3RAxwm and Corn.
			mon Jnurier.
			3lORSBT V. XVUFF.
			-Ur.. ejeanut neott aned !kr. IL James appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. I J. Jowell and Mr. hiacnamama for the defendant.
			Tho plaintiff in this actlon was a mitral merchant at olverbampton, and he sued the defendant to recover the valne of four casks of a composition for keansdng hoilere, which, it was alegod, the detendant had converted to nis owzn use, sad also f or money had and received to the plain - tiff's use.
			It appeared the defendant was the manufacturer of the composition, near Bradford, in Yorkshire, and had sent several casks of it to hls agent, a person named Brooks, to be forwarded to the purchasers. The goods were refused, and subsequently, by arrangement bh- zween the defendant and Brooks, they became Brooks's pro- perty. Brookrs subsequently becamae bankrupt, and the de- fendan was appeinad his trade assignee. The casks in question were then sold by the direction of the defendant and the official aRssignee, and the plaintif became the pur- chaser of the four casks in question and vwo others for the sumnof 701. The four casswere at this time lying at the Dudley station, and the plaintiff requested Brooks to look after thom for him. It appeared, however, that the railway company, after giving notice to the consgnor and con. signee, sold the four casks to a person named Man- ning for 4Z. 10a. MIanning had succeeded Brooks as defendant's agent, and he sold tho casks on his own asceunt, but allowed the defendant a profit on the transaction. On the part of the plaintiff it was con- tended that this amounted to a conversion by the defendant or, at all events, as the money had been taken into account between Manning and the defendant, the latter was bound to return it. On the other hand, the defendant contended that there had been no possession by him, either actual or con- structive after the sale to Menning, and that the money had not been received by Manning to the defendant's nse, so as to render the defendant liable to refund it to the plaintiff.
			Mr. Baron BRAMWELL nonsuited the plaintiff; but nave the plaintiff leave to move to enter the verdict for lGo. 10a.

			B1:STLEY V. WAKaMY.
			Mr. J. J. Powell, Mr. Maonsmara, and gr. G. Griffiths appeared for tho plaintiff, and W. H. Coo-e for the defendant.
			This was an aotion of ejectment to recover pos,ession of a cottage In Albert-street, Cheltenham. The cottaze was copyhold of the manor of Cheltonbau. The plaintiffs title ws proved by the court rolls, showing the admlttance of the plaintiff, on surrender by one IPerrins, wbo had left Cheltealshamforn w Yore-k aboutl8 years ago. It appeared that the lord of the manor had appointed a special steward to tak-e the surrender in tN'ew York, and it was enteredl accordingly on the court rolls. The defendant's counsel objected that this was a defect in the plaintiff's title, but it was shown to be according to the eastem of the manor. The steward said they often took surrenders at the Cape of Good Hope and in India.
			Mr. Baron BRAnrwELL held the plaintiffs title to be suffietontly proved, and the jury found for the plaintiff.

			I OnIxAL CounT.-(Before .fr. JSUice KTINsG.)
			Uharles James Jiattishall surrendered to take his trial upon a charge of wilful andcorrupt perjury alleged to have beezn committed by him before Mr. Matthew Davenport Hi]], Commiesioner of the Bristol Diatrict Court of Bankrptcy, at Bristol, on the 28th of June, 1859, touching the bank- ruptcy of one Robert Wellg.
			Mr. W. H. Cooke and Mr. J. J. Powell appeared for the prose.cution; Mr. Huddleaton, Q.C., and M1r. H. James .efended the prisoner.
			The defendant in this case had formerly been In the em- ploy of Robert Wells, a wholesale tca dealer and grocer at Bristol, who had become bankrupt, and the charge against him was that when he was examined he. fore the Commissioner of Bankruptcy at Bristol, on tho 28th of June, 1859, touching the effects of the bankrupt, he committed wilful and corrupt perjary, in order to conceal his fraudulent removal of the boankrupt's goods. It appeared that on the 9th of February, 1859, Wells nado a declaration of Insolvency in the Bristol Court, and tho same dy hewas adjutdged bankrupt; ansgnees were ap- polated on the 21st of February,aenld on the same and follop- ing days the defendant was examined. The defendant was in the employ of the bankrupt, and claimed a large portion of hi proerty in espetofadvaces hic oh alleged he had made to 'the ba5nkrupt.HUe said ldhoh had been In Austali, ad ha moey,whic hehadadvanced to the bankrupt to the ehten oe OOO. on te warrants, &amp;o. The
			of June the defendant was againeamndtuhgte effects of the bankrupt, and then gave he evidenc on wrhich Perjr was now. as od. Hoswore that since the 1st of anuary, 1859, he ad not possessed himself of any goods of the bankrupt beyond what appeared in certain accounts marked B and C; that he did not know of any par' of the bankrupt's effects being disnosed of out of the ordinary wvay of trade, since the 1st of January, 1859 ; end that he had not himself removed, or sasisted in the removal of any of the bankrupt's goods, out of the ordinary way of trade, since the Iet of January, 185. Several witnesses were called, who provedl that on the 8th of February the defendant went over to one of the bankrpt's ahops at Newport, and said it was " a case of al up, and1 mah, man Immediately took off his coat and began to pack up goods for removal. He palcked up 14 cwt. of goods in boxee, which he directe t-o various parties, andI rent them off by the railway the next morning, under a false description, telling the people In the shop If any inquiries were made, to say that no goods had been removed. He t-ook away money and books, destroyedl Invoices, and told tho shopmen that Mr. Wells had no further interest in the business, and they might use what was left. He also sent two bags of sugar a-id one of te to his sister-In-law, and carried off in a bag as much lumpsugar as he saidI would be allowedhim as personal lugagMe. ie also removed goods in a similar manner from the bankrupt's shop at Cardiff. Subsequently a warrant vws issued for his apprehension, and he vas at length taken into cusatody in the island of Jersey, on the 13th of August, 1859. He wan thent waiting to see the Queen land, andL was mutch surprised at his arrest, and disputed its validity. HeO said he had gone to Jersey to avoid the persecution of the assignoes, and the arrest was only a trick resorted to by the assignees, In order that they might get him within the j urisdction of the Civil Court. However, he was brought over, and now surrendered toD takce his trial on the charge of perjury. It appeared the defendant's claim upon the bankrupt amounted to 3,0001., and for that amount he held securities which he had realized, hut he assignees had brought an astion against him,zinorder to try the question as to the reality of the alleged advances to the bankrupt aud the defendant's right to the securities.
			Mr. HUDDLESTOs' addressed the jury for the defendant, and admitted that if the charge againsb tho defendant had been one of siding, the bankrupt I making away with his property he should have had some difficulty, but he con- tended that It was unfair to indict the defendant for answers given to such general quaestions. His attention ought to have been called to the partioulars, and, had that been dane
			the defendant might have been able to explain that he had
			a right to remove the goods as being his own property.
			Mr. Justice KEATIXO,, in summing up the evidence to the jury, said he thought it would have be-en more fair end correct if the defendant had been questioned as to the par- ticular points of the removal of the goods frm epot
			which were known at the time of the exam i but,
			he had removed wiere his ovwn. If the goods were notth

			The jury found the prisoner CeeWly, end
			Mr. JnuticeuKUA.TsG, aftersome comments on theserious naturo of the offence, sentenced the prisoner to 1S months' imprisonment with hard labour.

Judkcins on the 10th of October, 1852, for an inven- tion of an improved sewing maschine, entitled " Improve- ments in Machinery or Apparatus for Sewing or Stitching." The defendant by his pleas denied the infringement, and alleged that the patent was void for want of novelty in the Invention, and for want of a proper specification. There was also a plea denying the due dassgment of the patent to the plaintiff.
			The plaintiff claimed by assignment from the assignees of the patentee, who had become bankrapt, and one objection -viz., that she appointment of the assignees had not been registered, as required by the 35th section of the Patent Laiw Amlendment Actwas reserved for the opinion of the Court of Common Pleae. The patentee (who was a foreigner) hadi on the l0th of Auignst, 1852 obtained in the name of B. T. Hughes a patent for an fvention, which the defendant contended was in many parts the same as the invention for the infringement of the patent. for which the action was
			brought, and which invention was, therefore, not new atthe date of that patent h

			Thiswas avn action to recover 6sl.,tho balance of the price of cloth alleged to have been sold by. the plaintiff to the defendant. The cloth, it appsared, had been ordered by 'ho defendant, and sent to him by the plaintiff. After some time had elapsed the defendant had accepted a bill for 631.

The acceptance, it wsna serted,sass given by the defendant only at the mrgent solictstion of the plain. tif, and upon the express understanding that the plsinti�t should take it up when due, or pay interest For it to the defendant untl the flinds arrived from Ameclsa.

			Dir. X. emrnith. Q.U., and Ur. Coleridge were for the Plaintiffe, and Mr. Butt, Q.C., and Mr. i-ideuax for the defendant.
			This was an action for the recovery of 3611. 2s. 4d., thes proportion of loss sustained by plaintiffs as inspectos of the estae of W. Dobbin and Son, late1emigration agents of thin city.
			Defendant pleaded "Not liable."
			At a meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Dobbin, In March, 1856, It was agreed to wind up the concern, and ia case of loss it was to hemade by a call on the creditors' pro rate. By the dleecl Mr. Carrard, a wine merchnt ; Mr. Bryant, bonded storekeeper; and Mr. F. uckc, dalea bankrupt, becamo inspectors anid trstee of the esate ; and, th affair not torning out Ls profitable as expected, a demand of lOs. 105.

Several of the creditors objected to pay, and, after giving credit for all receipts, the inspectors' loss on windin no the concern amounted to 1;053l. 7s. 2a., one-thirdof eih was the sum claimed In this action. The plaintiffs testified that they. undertook the inspectorship on being assured by defendant thathe wonld assist them,that there would be norlsk, and, if
			there were, that hewould "sail in the same boat withthem.'2. He bad all through the transaction tak-en a leading part,'. mid they said they acted almost on his dictation.

			MILITARY AN wNAVAL iNTELLIGENCE.
			Tho chartered East India troopship Warrior Queen, 998 tcons, Capt. W. lHenry, arrived at Gravesend yesterday, from Calcutta, with sick and disabled troops on board, and a number of eoldlers of various regiments whose time of service has expired, and who are sent home to be dis- charged. The troops embarked at Calcutta on the 23d of December and sailed the folowing day, the only land touched being St. Helena, which was reached oa the 12th of February, the passage to the Thames occupying 99 days. The number who embarked on hoard was three o�6cers, 127 non-commissioned oficers and men, 16 mIlitary lunatics, 19 invalid seamen of the Indiaa navy, and 16 women and children. The troops belong to the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Medical Staff Corps, 6th Dragoon Guards (Carbineers), 3d Bnffs, 5th Fusnleers, 19th, 34th, 35th, 38th, 48th, 53d, 54th, 60th Rifles, 80th, and 99th Regiments, the whole being under the command of Capt. J. Gibsone, 17th lancers, and Lient. W. H. J. Clarke, 53d Regiment, and in medical charge of Asslst.-Snrg. J. Collins, M.D., 87th Royal Irish Fnslleers. During the voyage there were 11 deaths on board-namely, seven Eoldiers, two invalid seamen, one lunatic, and one woman. The sick and wounded troops and the insane men were landed yesterday afternoon, andfor. warded to Fort Pitt, Chatham, where they were medically in- spected by Surgeon-Major Prendergast, M.D.,and the staff at that establishment, when 30 men were ordered into hospitaL the insane menbeiag taken to thelunatie hospitaL The troops not requiring medical treatment were sent to St. Mary's Invalid Establishment to await their discharge. The Royal Artillery invalids were forwarded to Woolwlch, and the maval invalids wvAl be landed at Blackwall.
			The Second Division of the Channel I seet, comprising the Edgar, 91, screw, Capt. James E. Katon, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral of the Blue John R. Erskine; the Queen, 86, screw, Capt, C. F. Hillyar; the Algiers, 91, screw, Capt. G. W. D. O'Callaghan; the Mars, 80, screw, Capt. J. N. Strange; and the Mersey, 40, screw, Capt. H. Caldwell, C.B., steamed into Spithead from the Channel yesterday morning by the eastern entrance in the order named. The Edgar having anchored, each succeeding ship steamed to the westward of the flagship, and, rounding to, proceeded to their respective positions. The Qneen took up the e3stern berth of the line, a-head of the Edgar. To the westward of the Edgar the Alglrs anchored, and the Mars took up the western berth. The four liners are thus moored in a line from south-east to north-west. The Mersey frigate brouzght up in deeper water en the outside of the line. Soon after the ships came in sight the customary salutes were exchanged between the Edgar, flagship of Rear-Admiral Erskine, and the Victory, flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Vice-Admfral Bruce. The Sprightly and Pigmy steam tenders were despatched fror the harbour to Spithead on the fleet's arrival.
			We have received the folowing letter from Her Majesty's screw troopship Simoon, dated " Singapore, February 22, lS60":-
			" We arrived here yesterday 41 days from the Cape and 93 from England. All well on board. We proceed in a few days for China. In Banco Straits we feU in with the Ring- dove, and gave her a tug along, as she was short of fuel. The Rtenard saited from here to-day forPenang to tow up a troop- ship, which the Scout will convoy to the northward. The :Pearl leaves in a day or two with the 44th Regiment, balf the regiment being on board the Pearl and the remainder in a transport. The Rlngdove Is refitting, and when complete goes to Penang to forwvard along any other ships. The Esk Is the senlor officer's ehip here. We are the first batch of soldiers out, and, as operations do not commence before the middle of April, we shall be in plenty of time. The maU steamer starts to-day, so we are lucky in having time to wrlte home. Our passage from England has been good; no lives or spars lost, nor sails spli t. Off the Cape we had a shower of ice, mnd pieces fell in ragged shapes, weighing from 3 to 6 ounces. Several men were hurt, but luckily none were aloft at the time or they must have been knocked off the yards. It lasted only about a minute; bad it been of any long continuance it mest have cut our saDls from the yards, 3esSdes doing other damage. As the lee fell on the decks it sounded below Itke shot being rolled about overhead. No one on board ever saw or heard of the like before, and it, as you may imagine, quite astonished us. It was no hailstorm, _assure you.,
			The blocls are being prepared in No. 7 dock at Ports- mouth for the reception of the Victoria, 121, screw.

			THE TD1NAPPING OF COOLIES.
			The folowing Is the letter from the aetied Cora- nanders-in-Chief Ini China to the foreign consular body at Canton, mentioned in our leading article of this day
			"Cantont, Jan. 12.
			"Gentlemen,-We have the honour to forward for your Information and consideration copies of a communication and Its enclosures, from his Excellency Laon, the Governor- General of these provinces, to the allied Commitssioners, dated the 6th tnst., requlestng the a,llied Commanders-in. Chief to advise him as to the meassures best calculated to effect the suppre3sson or the Whampea Coolie trade, carried on as this has latey been under circumstances moot in- jurious to the character and Interests of the foreign com- mnnnity.
			"We also take this opportunity of placing before you the depositions of 105 men, who have lately been brought away from certain Coolie receiving ships at Whampoa- namely, the American ships Messenger, Ploneer, Governor
			forton, and the Oldenburg bark Fanny Kirchner ; you wll read rwith pain the partculars therein given of the system of torture that has been pursued in order to wring from the victims of the trade a nominal consent to an eight years' engagement in the island of Cuba and yout wll see that a deceptton has been practised in order to induce them to believe that their shipment had received the sznction of their own authorities. Notice may also be taken of the assertion so frequentlyrepeated in the depositions that those Coolles who have not yet been removed from the above- named ships remain on board against their will, and that their endeavours to make that unwillingness known arc sup- pressed by the persons who have them in charge.
			" We doubt not that you wil concnr with us in thinking that it can be no sufficient defence of the system to say that this violence and deception is in most cases the act of the Chinese, and not of foreigners, engaged in the trade. The latter must long ere this have become acquainted both with the true character of the instruments they employ and the abuse to which thepayment of head money must lead; and there is, moreover, evidence to show that the illtreatment of which tbe Coolles complain is not unfrequently inflicted on board the foreign vessels and by foreign hands.
			"In case it should be thought that these depositions are not deserving of full reliance, we should Inform you that each witness was examined separately and out of the hear- Ing of his companions, and it is not easy to see what object the majority of the witnesses could have In fabricating falsehoods after they had once re-acquired their liberty. Bat In case some of your body would wish to test for themselves the accuracy of these statements, or to obtain further In- formation from the witnesses themselves, we have sanc- ttoned their temporary detention in Canton, in order that they maybe brought before you if you desire It.
			" To the first named letter from his Excellency laon to the Commissioners we are now able to add another one, dated January 9, communicating the courso adopted in the case of the Fanny Kirchner, which his Excellency is desirous to show is uniform with that pursued towards the American receiving ships. We haverefrained from any description of the fatal occurrences of the night of the 4th inst. on board the last named vessel, or of the recent trans- actions connected with the Coolie cargo of the Meesenger, but if, when engaged in the consideration of the subject, yon should desire additional information, cither as to the proceeding we have alluded to or the general question of man stealing as it Is now extensively carried on in these districts for the eupplv of the Coolie trade, we mav refer
			yoU w tMe alueeu UomMlssioners, who have ample details in their possession.
			" Fully sensible, gentlemen, that the suggestion of those preventive measures which hts Excellency Laon is so anxious to see institated appertains rather to your province than that of the allied Commissioners, we would wish to place the matter In yonr hands, and to beg yon to concert among yourselves the measures best oalculated to correct the abuses that have been brought to light. We may mention, however, that this is the second appeal which his Excellency has made to us on this subject, the first being simultaneons with the Issue of his recent circular to the consular repre- sentatives, announclng-tother the establishment of a system of free emigration, and requesting them to require their re- spective countrymen to conform to the rules upon which that system is based. It appears, however, that his Excel- lency's reqnisition has been only partialy complied with, for while several persons connected vwiththe shipment of Coolies at Whampoa desisted from their operations on being warned by the consular authorities of their Illegal character, others again, with little appreciation of his Excellency's liberal concessions, and in direct opposition to his prohibi- tions, continued to collect Coolies through the agency of crmp boats, and to receive them on board the above-men- tloned ship9. The prevention of such proceedings In future, and the faithfnl observance of the rules established by the Governor-General, is the point which should now engage the attention of aU responsible persons in this community, connected so Immediately as the subject is with the peace and order of this important port and the preservation of a good feeling between foreignersand the Chinese population. We confess that wedo not ourselves see why It should be more difficult to control foreign vessels when engaged in the shipment of contract labourers than when following any other ordinary operation. Whatever may be the steps ne- cessary to secure the ends in view, you will, we zre satisfied, see with us that the unscrupulous acts of a few persons, such as those we are now pointing out, are liable to imperil the best Interest and even the personal safety of your com- munities, and that although tho preseneo of the allied force in this city may serve for a time to shield foreigners gene- raly from the consequences of these acts, they may be fol- low ed by a serious recoil when that safeguard shall be with- drawn, unless due security against the wrongs complained of shall in the meantime have been provided.

			IBBLAND.
			DUBLUN, WEDNEA5DXA HOmG. TIE POST-OPFICE MAD TE H5WPAPERS.
			The announcement made last night by the Secre- tary of the Treasury respecting tie Chancellor of the Exchequer's intention to abide by his decision with regard to the improssed newspaper stamp has oiven great dissatisfaction here. TheFreemnof this morning makes a fierce onslaught upon the Hills," under whose influence Mfr. Gladstone is charged as being ready to take the frst step towiards the sup- pression of the newspaper "nuisance." After re- capitulating the obvious inconveniences of the new system, the .Frecmam1 goes on to say:
			"Another of the HEil ideas Is, to de away vwth the im. pressed stamp, and Impose on publishers the tedious duty of fixing a 'penny head' on each paper which is Fent by post, the effect of which will be to delay an ordinary pubEcation hal an hour to an hour, or to compel the publishers to go to press an hour earlier, and without the later telegrams- another ingenious device for maldng the newspaper be deemed a 'nuisance,' by maldng it the vehicle of old, not late, news. The adoption of these Hill Ideas will prove very perplexing to metropolitan newspapers, but It wlll prove utterly ruinous to country iommuals, whose subscrlbers are for the most part not concentrated in towns, not accessible by railways, but scattered over the face of a country through which but one, or at most two, lines of railway ran. The interest of the newspaper proprietor is, however, the least Importart consideration. The public, who pay for the Post-office establishment, have a right to the best servico it can render; and in these days of telegrams, when the markets fluctuate with a rapidity almost miraculous, and when early know. ledge Is wealth, the newspaper is an essential of success to the farmer and trader, and no tampering with it can be permitted without producing a most injurious effect upon the material progress of the country. We commend this subject to the pubijo consideration durlng therecess, with a view to having the rrish representatives instructed not to allow Mr. Hill to play his pranks with freedom in thia country, where we as yet have no universal substitute for the postal service."
			SPRIfG OPER&amp;Tro,\S,
			Althouigh bitterly cold for the season, there has been a slight improvement in the weather since the commencement of the week. To be sure, there was a heavy fall of snow on the 2d of April, which com- pletely capped the Dublin and Wicklow mountains; but, as a set-off, there have been frequent bursts of warm sunshine, followed by the usual April showers. Nothing, howvever, can ho much worse than the provincial agricultural reports, all of which speak of the unprecedentedly backward state of spring ope- rations, owing to the protracted winter and the general inclemency Of the weather for the last four or five months.

			THE NEW TREATY WITH FRANCE.
			BIRMIINGHAAX, WEDNEsDAY.
			At a meeting of the Council of the Chamber of Commerce held this day, the following reply was agreed upon to cer- tain questions recently submitted by the Board of Trade:-
			" 1. This Chamber considers that the duties upon half- manufactured articles-such as iron and steel; iron, steel, brass, and copper wire; brass and copper sheets; iron and brass tubes for bollers, steam, and gas, iso. ; and tin plates- should be levied by weight; and that the duties upon all ar- ticles entirely manufaotured should be taken ad valo cm.
			" 2. This Chamber is unable to give the average price of the manufactured articles known as 'hardware.' The goods are so varied, and the qualities of each single article so numerous that any approximate calcuilation would be of little assistance to my Lords; for instance, brass locks, which are made from 9d. to lS0s. per dozen and upwards; steel pens, from lA.d. per gross to lSs. 6id, and upwards; fire irons, from lO3. per set to 20s. and pwards; plated candle- sticks, from . per pair to SOs. and upwards; japanned tea-trays, from Sd. per dozen to S.hi and upwcards. Numerous other articles might be mentioned as further illustrating to
			ifpossibiLity of affording any information to my Lords on this subject.
			"3. This Chamber is of opinion that thoe French Treaty will be of little benefit to the manufacturers of Birinogham in the event of a duty at all approaching 30 per cent, bein,g levied upon manufactured articles, as such a duty would afford the French manufacturer a protection whilc would prevent the impartation into France of most of the leading articles of this district.
			" 1pon the articles known as hardiwares this Chamber is of opinion that moderate duties, such as those levled by the neighbouring countries of Belgium and Hlolland, wosuld greatly benefit the trade of thiselocality.

			EASr COAST HERRTNG FISHERY
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Tn a letter from MIr. A. a. Milier, of Glasgow, which appeared in your paper of tho 3d inst, your attention Is caUed to the system of catching herrings snd other fish before reaching maturity w hich as present prevails on the coast of Scotland, and the injurious egects on the fishery elearly explained. I regret to inform you that this Infanti- eide Is carried on to a great extent in the Wash aud off the Nsorfolk and Llncolnahire coasts.
			During the autuamnal and wainter months it is not un- common for a smlack of 13 or 14 tons to land durin&gt; one week five or six tons of smaU stuf6 (or, in other woras, of young herrings, sprats, and other young fish), nearly all of which is totally unfit for human food, andi it is commonly sold at about 11. per ton to the farmer, -who puts it on his land.
			A great many smacks belonging to Grimsby, Lynn, and Boston are more or less engaged in this trade, and it is diffi- calt to imagine what destruction of immature fish takes
			lace in the many hundred tons they land; but there can ba little doubt that the present practice is likely to eradicate our coast fishery in toto.
			Now, Sir, if you could draw the attention of the practical public to the present want of proper regulation in this most important interest, ouir present shameful abuse of the bountiful gifts of Providence might be put a stop to, and some means adopted by which the food of thousands and the emplovyment for as many more of our population migbt be preserved to us. Bv so doing you would add another to the many benefits you have given to your country.
			I am, Sir, a fisherman, and vour obedient servant
			FRAICIS JOSEPH.

			N'w Ci,o=.-On Mtonday and Tuesday last experiments were made at the Mdound, Woolwlch. with a new gun manufactured by MJessrs. Brown and Hughes, Newport, 3Mnmouthshire. The gun is of seuli-stee' ron (homozeneous), and is of the sameinternal diameterand bore as Sir &gt;v. Armstrong's 12-pounder. The rounds were fired as follows:-10 rounds of each up to and inclusive of S shots, making 80 rounds; and when this point had been at- tained the copper venting of the gun, which had been put in by the authorities at Woolwich, gave way, and prevented the completion of the programame, intended for 100 rounds. The gun was carefully examined, and has not sustained the slightest damage fromthe severe tests with which it was proved. The makers say it can be manufactured at half the cost of Armstrong's or WVhitworths, caLn be used as either muzzle or breech loader, and is capable of being rifled with Ieither Lancaster's, Armstrong's, or Wltworth's systems,- IMc~knj&amp; Mo.azs2ne

			SANITARY CONDTION OF T CIE
			At tho meeting of the Olty Commloners of SeBwers held yesterday at GadidhaU, Ar. Deputy Christio in the chair, Dr. Letheby, the medlcal officer of health for the city, sub- mitted his quarterly report, as follows:-
			" The returns for tho winter quarter, which has just expired, show that fewer persons havo died, and fewer children have been born, within the clty, than is usual for the season. In the course of the lest ten years the average number of births in the quarter has been 9S5, but in that which has just expired the number has bean only S72, and the proportion of deaths has i31fen from an average of 83S to S2S. A t first sight, there- fore, it would appear that the general mortaiity of the season had not been unsatisfactory, but a closer examina. tUon of the fasts vrll show that the reduction of the death. rate has not been In equal proportion to that of the birth- rate; and this indicates not merely a great fallig-off in the number of the population, but also that the season has been unusually unhealthy. In the central and western divisions of the city, for example, the deaths have ezceeded the births in rather large proportion, for in the former the deaths were 2S0, and the births but 269; and In the latter the deaths were 282, and the births only 219. Besides whicb, it wil be remarked that in every one of the city sub-districts, excepting the north and south divisions of the Western Union, the births are greatly below the average for the season; and even in these divisions they have risen but from 210 to 219. These facts are significant, for they point not onlv to a fluctuation in the number of the population, but also to a change in the character of it; and if I could place before you the returns of marriages for the quarter, I have no doubt that the results would be still more remark- able. In truth, tbey show that there aro some parts of the city which aTr becoming so exciusively devoted to the purposes of commerce as to shut out that portion of the population which maintains its numbers.
			" Of tho 82S deaths in the quarter, 306 wero in the Eastern Union, 242 in the Western, and 2SO in the CentraL These are in tho annual proportion of 27-4 per 1,000 of the Inhabitants of the first-named division, 33-8 of the secDnd, and 197 of the third; making a total of 25-4 for the whole of the city. In all England at this season of the year the average mortality is at the annual rate of 24-6 per 1,000 of the pop,alaUion, and in the chief towns it is about �6-5- while mn the conutry districts it is only 22 2. Mea- sured, therefore, by these standards, it is evident that the eastern and western divisions of the city havo had a large death-rate during the quarter; but, as will be pre- sently seen, this has not been caused by zymoti, or pre- ventible disease, but by the trying infleneu of the weather -the effects of which have been manifested in the high mortality, of infants and old persons especially, from lung diseases ; in fact, there were 295, or rather more than a third of all the deaths among chidren of less than five years of age, and 214, or nearly a third, among old persons of 60 and upwards ; so that these classes have farnished about two-thirds of the whole mortality.
			" Pneumonia and bronchitis havo been fatal in 2S1 cases, the average for the season being but 194, and of these the attacks of pneumonia have been chiefly confined to the young and bronchitis to the old, both of which classes are especially subject to the morbid influences of a cold and ohangeable atmosphere. Next among the principal causes of death is phthisls, which has been fatal in 87 cases. These, with 35 deaths from tabes and serofula, and 19 from hydrocephalas, make a total of 141 deaths from tubercular or developmental diseases. The aver- age for the season, however, is 155, and there- fore it would seem that the atmospheric influences of the season have had but littlo to do with this class of dis- orders. In point of fact, as they aretheresults oE adiseased growth and of defective assimilation, they are checked, rather than otherwise, by a cold season. Thi number of deaths from zymotic diseases has also been unusually small, for, except in one instance, namely, in that of smallDox, every disease of this class has been below the average. Diarrh ea has fallen from 10 to 7 continued fever, includ- ing typhus and typhoid fevers, from 28 to 20 ; scarlet fever, from 19 to 15; measles, from 20 to 13 ; erysipelas, from 7 to 3 ; and whoopingeough, croup, and diphtheria from 46 to 31 ; malking in aUl a reduction of from 130 to 89.
			"But smallpox has risen from an average of 7 in the quarter to 22, and although this is a large increase, yet it ftrnishes no idea of tho great prevalence of tho malady. My attention is stiU being directed to the progress of the dis- ease, for I hope that the results of my inquiries may throw some light on the protective power of vaccination, and on the means for increasing the successful practice of it. At present I have collected the records of 223 cases of smallpox, all of vhich have oceurred within the city during the last nine months, and of which number 62 have been fatal. 122, or rather more than half of the whole number, had been succeasfully vaccinated, and 24 had not been vaccinated at all; the others had been either vaccinated without success, or had furnished uncertain returns. But the general results of my inquiries are that of the fatal cases 52 per cent. had not been vaccinated, 1S per cent. had been vaceinated without success, and 30 per cent. had been vaccinated, as it was thonght, successfully. Of thecases which recovered, 72 per cent. had been vaccinated successfully, 6 per cent. not succesefully, and 22 per cent. had not been vaccinated at
			all. :io that of the fatal cases as many as 70 per cent. had not been protected by vaccination, and of the recove- ries 72 per cent. had. Tho average temperature for the quarter lias been 40-6, which Is nearly the mean of the last 43 winters ; but this average has not been maintained throughott theseason, for in the month of January the temperature was nearly 5-5 degrees above the average, and late in the quarter it had fallen to as many degrees below it. The daly range of temperature has also varied from 6 or 7 degrees Fahrenheit to 19, and when these changes were observed the mortality has quickly rose from a weekly average of 64 to upwards of S0. The lowest tesperature In the qaarter (253S) was registered on the 14th of February, and the highest (5G-5) on the 3d of January. The variations of the barometer have not been remarkable, although the mean pressure (29'79) has been a little below the average. The range in the movement of the mercury has been from 28172 to 3061. As regards the moisture of the air, it has generally been abundant, amounting, on an average, to 83 per cent. of saturation, and it has ranged between SO and 96 per cent. Lastly, there have been 48 wet days in the quarter, and a total rain-fall of 4-75 inclhes.
			Altogether there have been 2,452 inspections of houses, of which 798 have been Inspections of the common lodging-houses, 2-32 have been made in consequence of the occurrence of 86 cases of smallpox, 8S of continued fever, and 02 of dlarrhoesa, all of which have been returned in the parish books by the medical officers of the unions. The resuilt of these inspections has been the issuing of 468 orders for works of sanitary improvement.:'
			The report was ordered to be printed and circulated among the members of the Court.

			TrnE DEFrwCES OF THE CiNNm ISIuaXDs.-We are glad to learn, from late and sure authority, Her Ma- jesty's Government is not unmindful nor forgetful of the words of tho Duke of Wellington, " Onco get a good naval station at the Channel Islands, and you wil be as free from French invasion as If you were in my own room." It is now 15 yeara since the Government of the day appointed a secret comllilssion, composed of mUitary and naval officers, to survey tho islands of Guernsey, .Jersey, and A lderney, and to report upon the best means of fortifying them, and of establishing at each a naval station, or harbour of refuge, as it wvas called, for obvious reasons. The commiEslioners suggested the construction of such barbours at the three Islands, but at two only were their suggestions carried out. The harbour of St. Katherine's, Jersey, which is imme- diately opposite St. Male, has one breakwater complete, and could afford accommodation to a considerable squadron, but tho principal works are being carriei on at Alderney, whose small ordinary population of 1,200 inlsabitants is nosv increased by a settlement of 900 artisans and 60 horses, working under the direction of Messrs. Jackson and Byng, the contractors. An immense breakwater had been con- structed at Braye Bay, capable of affording shelter and anchorage to 15 sail of the line, at a distance of about eight miles from Cape La Hogue and Cherbourg, on on0 side, and not more than 40 from Portland, on the other, wvhere there is accommodation for a powerful fleet. The new har. bour Is studded with recently-erected forts, armed with guns of the lif aviest calbre, and the whole of the works are being carried on with the greatest activity. It Is the confident opinion of competent judges that when these fortifications of the Channel Islands have been completed all chanco of annioyance from Cherbourg rill be quite out of the ques- tion, 'Tho whole of the works have been planned by and are under the direction of Messrs. Walker, Burgess, and Cooper. the Trinity-house engineers.-U7nited Service Gazetle.

The discoverynas made by PolUce-constable No. 169, of the R division, who noticed an unnsual body of smoke issuing from tho front of the house. The officer at once gave an alarm, and by repeatedly knocking at the door he managed to awake the inmates, consisting of 'Dr. Cohen, Isadora Lindsmen, Ann Mtorrison. TIyman Cohen, and Samue! Haywood. These peraons at once ran to the stairs, hoping to bc able to descend by them;- but the flames wsere rushing up so fiercely that they wvere obliged to retrace their steps to the upper rooms,vwhere they doubtless would have perished had it nok. been for the timely aTrival of Conductor S, Wood, of the Xoyal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire. Owing to the narrowness of the court, Wooid was unable to wheel the machine to the houise, and was obliged to unship the ladders, and then put them in front of the house, at a moment when the whole of the above-named persons were screaming for help. The conductor ascended the ladders and carried down the pro- prietor and his son, the latter 2A years of age. He then rescued a child 15 months old andua female servant, 14 years old. At that time there was a boy, 15 years of age. in the second floor back, and unable to got over the landing on accoentoftbefamees. Wood tricd to passthrough tohnim, but was driven back by the flames. He then selzedalamplighter's ladder, which he carried through the adjoining houses, and by placing it on a wooden shed he made a bridge and by that expedient was enabled to reacue the boy, but in so doing the weight of the escape nman and the boy forced the end of the ladder through the roof. Every one, however, wvas rescued, and the present make 119 lives saved by the samo man. Tho engines of the parish and London Brigade quickly attended, but the fire wasw not extinguished untU the premises were partially destroyed. The loss will fall upon the Royai Fire-oflioe. The origin of the fire is unknown.

			RED-TA PBISM.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TfIS.
			Slr,-Conslderable dissatisfaction has been created arnong the Volunteers here by the receipt of an order from the lleutenanoy-office at Preston, which, without assgning any reason for so doing, re-numbera the 14 divisions of Artllery Volunteers.
			The regiment of ArtiUlery, 610 strong, under the com- mand of Lieutenant-Colonel Browne, for instance, is suddenly re-numbered, and, after having been known for six mnonths as the4th Lancashire, is nowvto becalled the 5th,
			This will, of course, necessitate great alterations in the books, the change of the number on the buttons, crests, ac- coutrements, band instruments, &amp;c., and, independently of the expense the regiment wiU have to incur consequent on the alteration, it is evidently tnfair to the largest regiment of ArtiRlery volunteers as yet enrolled, who are, not unnatu- rally, somewhat proud of their original designation.
			The numbers were fixed by the Lord-Lieutenant, the aij of Sefton, in October last, and all the commiss1ons and. other documents were made out accordingly.

			AFRICAN EXPLORATION.
			TO THE EDITORw OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-The interesting account of the recent discoveries of Dr. Livingstone in the vicinity of the Lakes Shirwa and Nyinyesi (or Nyassa) read before the Royal Geographiod Soclety at its last meeting gave rise to some observatlons Ia connexion with the expedition about ts start, under tho command of Captains Speke and Grant, in continuatlon of the previous explorations of Captain Speke to the north of Lake Nyanza, the region of the supposed sources of the lfile. Taking the warmest interest In the success of this great enterprise, and having already submitted a plan of co- operation to the society under tho auspices of which and the patronage of the Foreign-office tho expedition is toa proceed, the chairman (Sir R. Murchison) expressed a, hope that 3ler Majesty's Government would furnish me with the support necessary to carry it into' execution. Not having seen any notice of that meeting in The Times, I venture to furnish you with the substance of the remarks that I made on that occasiorv and trust that, affecting as they do not only the success of t the expeedition, but the personal safety of the gallant leaders, you will allo,v them pubhcity through the mediu-m of your widely-circulated columns.
			From an experience of five years of the reglon in ques- tion, [ am enabled to state that the tribes to the north differ greatlyvin character from thoe to the south of tho Equator. Haviug had little or no interconrserwith traders and strangers, they are, in addition to being more fierce and warlike, in the last degree suspicious of and hostile to thoe entrance of any Into their territories; and not only is their hand lifted against the strange white man, but against evory one not of their own iidmediste tribe or locality. To enable any one successfully to penetrate into their country courago is not the only requisite, a tolerably intimate knowledge of their language and customs is indispensable. Ravino r acqulred this knocledge, which has enabled me hithertc to meet all emergencies, I foci convinced that I could reunder material assistance to the expedition. iinless |Captain Speke end his party happen to arrive at Bollgnan, on the Nile, in December or January no boats would be available wit}'in hundreds oF miles to convey them to Ehar. tum, in the absence of wvhich any attempt to march down the valley of the Nile w ould be inviting almost certain de- Istruction, either at the hands of the warliko aborigines or by starvation, the whole neighbouring district being worse, provided with anything in the shape of food than any other part of theeinterior known to me. It will he necessary therefore, for a couple of well-provisloned boats, with an experienced and .armed escort, sufficiently strong to repel any attack from the almost always halF-famishing natives of this country, to awrait the advent of the party at the IUpDer- Cataracb, In about 3 deg. 30 N. lat. Ipropose, nner these circumstances, conditonally npon the Government defraying tho actual outay, to provide the requisite boats provisions, and escort, and to place my knowledge n&amp; experience at the disposal of the expedition, independently of any remuncration for my personal services and the hard- ship and risk insepera le from such an undertakin.
			Feeling suro that, apart from theprospectivebenefts to commerce and civilization likely to flew from the successful accomplishment of this great scheme, the sympathies of Englishmen must bo enlisted in favour of an expedition having for its object the solution of that problem-rho dis- covery of the sources of the Nile-w hich has baffled the ingenuity of man for ages past,

			RoYs LNFIRAIRlY For. DISEASES OF THE CHEST. -Last night the 4Gth anniversary of this charity was cele brated by a (inner in the Loadon Tavern. This infirmary -the first institution of the kind in our coantty-was founded in 1S14 by the late Duko of Cambridge and Dr. Isaac Buxton,wbo respectively filled the offices of President and Physician. Orgiu.udly established in Spitalfields, it was removed as soon as its finances permitted from that nn
			healthy locality to Dean-street, ana subsequently to the City-road, where it now remains. Large numbers of patients sufering fromn variouS forms of disease of the chest havo found relief in the inflrmary, and every year the thrng f pplcats as nceasd.They come not; only from all. parts of Ctrhe medtropolis and Its suburb", but ofisn from conslderable distances. For
			o t,ng tuue past -u -UUU -i tue sUavity nave, as appears, been consumed in giving relief 'o out-door patients, and the wards of the infirmary have therefore been closed. An effort, however, is now being made to obtain suificient funds to open the wards to cases of acLte disease, the cure of which depends solely on careful nursing atd energetic treatment; and the contributlons have already been so liberal that it is hoped the time is near at hand when tbis may be done. At the din.ner last night Mr. R. W. Crawford, MLP., presided, and after the usaal loyal and patriotic toasts had been given, proposed " Prosperity to thelioyal Infirmary."' In doingoso ho said he knew nO more valuable institution than this w ithin the baits of the metropolis. It had affordedrellef in a largo I de"ree to persons suffering from diseases of the chest-a I specics of disease to which the inhabitants of our country I were pecUliarly liable, and it had proved an Incalculable,
			blessing to thepeople of that part of themetropolis n which it was situate. In ouir day almost every ill that flesh woa
			heir to was ministered tt by one or more hospitals; and since the Royal Infirmarywas founded other institations for the treatment of similar diseases had sprang up in the me- tropolis, which had, no doubt, abstracted a portion of tho contribntions formerly accorded to It. He hoped, however, tbat the original inuSrmary would still receive the support it. was entitled to, as the first embodiment of a great char- table idea, and that it -would be upheld by liberal eubscriptions. He then gave the toast of the evening, which was warmly responded to. Among the other toasts were " The Chairman," by Mr. Thomas Baring, ALP., "1 leCororation of the City," "Tho Medical Officers," replied to by DBi. Richardson and Dobell; " The Treasurer and Committee," '" The Secretary, I. Smart, Esq.," &amp;c. The Secretary of the Infirmary stated that 4001. had bees collected in the conrso of the evening. Mr. Harker officiated as toastmaster, and the musical arrangements were under the charge of Mr. E. Gray, assisted ybgemse Eyles, Mia3 Messent, Mr. hI. Smith, and Mr. J. Burgess.
			Tuz ESD OF " B.&amp;r.nEs v. BIAuER.`"-The thbreo Judges were chatting together. It was en awful moment. At length 'be juryturned round, and, in ansver to the re- gular question, gave in, through their foreman, a verdict for the petitioner-MIrs. Barber was free ! lIr. Lamb, with his aceustomed deference of manner, gave his arm to his client, and conducted her out of conrt and Into the hall, wbere the hard women on tbp steps checred ber as she passed. Tho lady.asked her professional adviser if ehe had not done it well 2-the more so as it was all stuff and nonsense ;- Augustus had never beaten her at all. No ; she would nob go back in Mr. Lamb's carriage. She bad her own broug1am at the door. I vwas thundersirluk on arriving at the portal of the ball to see that the equipage in question was really. there-and in it a party with wbiskers. " Only my couch? Frederick !" she cried out, playfully, as off she drove, towards Chaing-cross.-From " Divorce a Vinculo," in Once a WCC4,

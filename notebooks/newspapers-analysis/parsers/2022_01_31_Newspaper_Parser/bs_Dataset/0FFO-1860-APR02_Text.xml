			In my letter of Wednesday it was said that the Swsis3 Government intended to protest against the occupation, military or civil, by France of the neutralized provinces of Savoy. I have now to at-ate that the Swiss Government has done what it intended. Dr. Kern, the Swims Minister in Paris, deposited yesterday in the hands of M. Thouvenel the new protest on the part of his Government against all or any execution of the treaty of the 24th of March concerning the cession of Savoy to France; that is, Switzerland protests against the taking possession, in any form, of the neutralized provinces until a previous understanding with thb Powers and with Switzerland, which, in accord- ancea with the principles of international law, is absolutely necessary, and which by the Eecond sriIcle of the treaty is expressly reserved, be effected.
			The Monifeur, as you wiU have learnt before this, has published the contract, deed of conveyance, treaty, or bywhatever name the instrument by which 500,000 or 600,000 Savoyards are bodily handed over by the " Re galantuomo?' to France, ought to be caled.
			A despatch announces that the bull of excommu- nication bas, after all, been published in Rome. It mentions no names, but is directed against al the actors, promoters, coadjutors, advisers, and adher- ents of the invasion of the Romagna.
			The Nuncio is about to leave Paris, but it is said that diplomatic relations with Rome will not be en- tirely broken off.
			The French Government has commissioned Count Herbingen, a captain in the Imperial navy, to pre- pare a report on the capabilities of the port of Villa- franca, in the newly-acquired territory ofEthe county of Nice. It is aaid that it is to become a naval eatablishment of the first order, and a station for part of the Mediterranean fleet. Magnificent quays are likewise to be constructed to facilitate the land- inz of merchandise.
			The fall in the price of Government securities at the Bourse to-day was as rapid as the rise yesterday. No rational cause can be assigned for either, except that, the large sum advanced to create the rise being exhausted, a reaction took place to-day.

			SATITIWAY, MARCTI 31,06 r.ar.
			The Swiss Confederation appears determined to make a stand on the Savoy annexation question, in spite of the elaborate notes of the French Foreig,n- office, aided by its ally the Journal des Debats (from which 31. St. Marc Girardin, its oldest and ablest contributor, has publicly separated himself). I told you yesterday that a second protest had been pre- sented by the Swisa Minister in Paris against the decree of annexation, so far as it may affect the neutralized provinces. I am now enabled to com- municate the document itself. It is as follows:-
			"To as ExcEL TFScy TnEv MNesTEna OF FoRzIqe
			AFF.AIs.
			" Parls, March 28.
			"Monsieur le Mrmistre,-The Government of the Swiss Confederatlon having been informed of the stipulations of the treaty by which His Majesty the King of Sardinia assents, with the condition of the sanction of tho Chambers, to the nnion of Savoy and the arrondissemaent of Nice to Fzance, as signed at Turln on the 24th, and published in the Aoniteur Usnirersel the 25th of this month, regrets to be compelled to take further steps with the EEmperor's Govern- ment to ptotect the interests of Swiss neutrality.
			" The object of this treaty Is evidently to unite aU the provinces of Savoy to France, and, consequently, those which are comprised in the neutrality of the Helvetic Con- federation. But the present state of things, such as ests- blllshed by the etipulations of the treaties of lSlo, cannot and ought notto be changed except with the previeow corsent of the Powers of Europe, and of Switzerland, which is most particularly interested in it.
			" The Government of the Emperor cannot deny that, where rights and interests of the nature of those at present under consideration are in question, the cession by one Power to another of a neutralized territory is equivalent to an essential changc affecting the vcry foundation of the reda- tions in question, and that the annexation of a territory guaranteed in the interest of the neutrality of another country bears quite a different character from that of the territory of States which are not placed in this exceptional character. Any execution of the above-mentioned treaty, so far as it may affect the neutralized provinces, would be regarded by my Government as contrary to the stipulations which have on international character,
			" The Federal Council is placed, therefore, in such a posi- tion as to be compeled to protest against any execution of this treaty as regards the neutralized provinces. It protests most particularly, while demanding the maintenance of the status quo, against nll voting on the annexatlon, against the taking possession: either in a mUitary or cvil character, of these provinces, until such time as an understanding shall havo been come to between the gua-anteeing Powers and with Switzerland.
			" The Federal Council will demand a meeting of the re presentatives of tho Powers who have guaranteed the nen. trality of the three provinces to Switzerland; and it reserves to itself, as the representative of the country most interested, and in conformity with the recognized principles of Euro- pean international law, to assert before them tho rights and interests of Switzerland.
			"h en Federal Council trusts that the Imperial Govern. rment wiU admit the justice of the claims which have been set forth-particularly, as in the second article of the treaty of the 24th of March, France binds herself to come to anz un- derstanding on this subject both wcith the Powers represented at the Congress of Vienna and with the Hetretic Cossfedera- tion.
			i' It is therefore but a natural and necessary consequence ef this stipulation to refrain from any measure of which the object would bo to execute the treaty as far as it affects the icutralized provinces previous to this understanding having been effected.
			" It is with thlis hopo, andwith ful confidenceinthesenti. mcnte of justice of the Government of the Emperor, that the undersigned has the honour to be, &amp;c.,
			'" KERN."
			A privte (Spanish) letter from BMadrid of the 2ith says that, in nddition to the terms of peace concluded between the Moors and Spaniards, there is a proviso that the Mloors are not to surrender, cede, or sell to any foreign Power the fortified place of Tangier. It further mentions that " the telegraphic despatch of yesterday (the 26th) from the head-quarters of the army, announcing the pre- ,lnsiaries of peace, contained in cipher the said proviso." The mere temporary possession of Tetuan, the writer says, finds no favour with the political parties. "The Minister of the Inte- rior," he continues, " is the more ardent partisan of the permanent occupation of Tetuan, and of the whole of the territory gained by our arms. The reason probably is, he feels that the Last hour of the Mlinistry is approaching; he affects some poli- tical motive as the cause of his fall, and think-s it popular to adopt tho cry of war at all risks, and of indefinite conquest, like those conquests which for 39 years back France has obtained in Algeria."
			The writer enters into some further particulars as to the motives for the war:-
			"'They were," he eays, " vain and futile. A pretext wa5 desired by somo for the war, and it was found; but Spain could have found a hundred greater causes of complaint than In October last against the Moors, and she never ;boh;gL of rain conquests in No'then Afrlca.
			The war was projected for a particular object, and noone thought on the conseqnences of it. Themilitary plans were no' very skilful ; they were carried on blindly; and the dirctlon of the operations ws disastrous enough. 500,000,000 reals spent, and 16,000 men hors dce comn&amp;s, to obtain-what? Why, 400,000,000 rea; and Heaven only know3 how many wars we may have before the last instalment is paiL. The temporary occupation of Tetuan will cause some unplessant momenta to the country; it will upset more than a dozen of Minlstries, one rapidly succeeding the other, and none but will be impeded in its march by this African queation. The public are of opinion that 400,000,000 realr do not compensate forthe Immense sacrificas in money nad blood made by the country, and it is not forgotte- tha O'Donnell had previously demanded of the Moors the ' lute surrender of Tetnan; And that in the intervme
			23d of February with Muley Abbas there was .L
			agreed upon, as O'Donnell insisted on keeping Leaa at any cost It is now known that O'Donnell has had to yeld on this point. The Fez Government bhvlng no authority over the wild Kabyles of the RBff, we must, I suppose, leave In Tetuan and Its Immediate icinity 20,000 men to keep our communications with the sea open, and, In case of need, to resist the attacks of the barbarous mountalneers who will be constantly annoying our soldiers. The expense of this force wil not be much under 40,000,000 reas (400,0001.) annually. You may then judge what are the great advantages Spain will have gained by her costly war with the Moors and the general disappointment of the
			country." .
			The writer of the letter enters into various par- ticularse touching the state of political parties at this moment in Spain, and he appears to be convinced that tho Cabinet, as it stands at preaent, will not long survive the return of O'Donnell to Madrid.
			P.S. Since writing the above I learn that another private letter from Mladrid announces that both the Queen and the public are equally dissatisfied with the peace, and indignant against O'Donnell; that the feeingis so strong that the Ministers determined to resign; that their determination was communi- cated to O'Donnell, who has also tendered his resignation; and that Her Majesty has refused to accept it until they ahall have rendered an account to the Cortes of the wholo proceeding. It is added that the greatest anger is manifested at Madrid against the Ministers, at the result of this il-advised war.
			Bullier's lithographic sheets contain the fol- lowing _

			THE ANNEXATION OF SAVOY.
			(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
			CaA: BERY, iARRCE 28, EVEmSo. Comummatum est.
			This morning, at half-past 9 o'clock, the first detachment of the French Army-four com- panies of the 80th of the Line-arrived here from St. Jean de Maurienne. To-morrow au equal number is expected, until the whole regiment has arrived. Although the first French troops passed, as you know, on Friday last into Savoy, and although every one knew that it was not merely to pass through, but to remain there, up to this morn- ing one could always keep up to a certain point the fiction that the glorious army of the magna- nimous ally of good King Victor Emmanuel was re- turning home laurel-crowned. This is now over. Chambery, the capital of Savoy, is occupied by the troops of His bIajesty the Emperor of the French.
			All along in this Savoy question there was a fea- ture which we find in every phase of it, and which will characterize this transaction aa one of the most curious of our times. It is, that all parties con- cerned in it seem ashamed of the part which they have to play, and are always trying by subtle com- promises to justify their ow n actions before them- selves and before the world.
			The reception of the French troops this morning had quite this character. They had been expected from day to day, and thus there had been sufficient time to make all preparations. Some of the most ardent supporters of the annexation to France- tapissiers. ferblanticrs, and lampisks-had been preparing French flags, French transparencies, and lamps, and yet no one seemed inclined to make a beginning by buying, much less exhibiting, them. Those who are loudest in their praise of the future were as much behind when the decisive moment came as those who looked more gloomily at events. The result of this was that the iapis- siersandlampistes, seeingthemselves deceived in their expectations, relented somewhat in their patriotic ardour, and when at last the arrival of the French troops was officially announced there was not a suflicient supply of their patriotic articles.
			The municipality, similarly embarrassed, pub- lished a confused and rambling proclamation, speak- ing of the return of the laurel-crowned troops after creating a great State on the other side of the Alps, inviting the inhabitants to take leave of the old dynasty, telling them that their King Victor Emmanuel acc,uieseed in thpir -i.h..
			to unite with the great French nation, that they were to receive the French troops as brothers ; on the top of the proclamation were the arms of the House of Savoy, and at the bottom " Pive Napoleon III." and " Vive la France." The proclamation by which the National Guard was convoked to receive the welcome auests at the station suffered equaUy from an em- barrassing confusion of ideas. On the station itself flagstaffs had been erected, half decorated with the Sardinian and half with the French flag, bearing on one side a medaUion with the cipher of the Emperor, and on the other one with the cipher of the Kiing. In the decorations of the Hotel de Ville the same thing prevailed, the old master having his share as wel as the new one ; the only difference being the Imperial arms over the balcony, giving a decided advantage to the rising star. Most of the few deco- rated privato houses showed the same anxiety to please two masters.
			The National Guard, -with their band, having taken up their position on the broad road before the station, to the number of a few hundreds, the muni- cipalitv arrived to greet the French troops at their entry Into the town.
			Not the least curious part in this curious pro- ceeding was the crowd, -which cannot have been less than a couple of thousand. In every other town in which I have seen crowds there is a pre- dominance of the male over the female sex. Now, I don't know whether the good King Victor Em- manuel has carried off most of the male Savoyards to gain an empire for him on the other side of the Alps, or whether whatever remained has gone to seek Fortune in Paris, or, lastly, whether the good town of Chambery wished to pay a compliment to the most gallant people of the globe; certain it is that the proportion usualy existing in other crowds be- tween men and women was here altogether reversed. WVherever you looked, nothing appeared but bonnets and crinolines, snow-white caps and blue aprons. One felt almost ashamed not to wear a petticoat, and therev were moments when one almost regretted not to be at least a sergeant of the gaUant 80th Regi- ment, so promising did the crowd look for a garrison town.
			The traiu arrived in due time, the band struck up "Partaut pour la Syrle," the men tried to get up a cheer, the soldiers answered, the women waved their handkerchiefs, the Syndio made his congratula- tory specch to the Coloel, aad the troops, accom-
			panied by the National Guard and followed by the crowd, went to their barracks, preceded by the band. The thing pased off very respectably. Soon after this tho eoldicra were again in the streets, where many of them found hospitable entertainers, as yoa might judge by the visible effect of their efforts a few hours afterwards. The town was rather more animated than usual, and I heard here and there, in passing, attempts at cheering the eoldiers. It may be that Savoyards ate not such demonstrative people as Italians are, but the endeavours to get up Lllch demonstrations are painful to witne6s. In vain did the limited number of enthugsats do their best, -they were not supp3i: bed by the rest. It was the very picture of thisgreat Savoy movement as I have seen it all a:onz-a sman number of active agitators, eni the restdead -ndindifferent. The decorations on t3" housea produced the same effect. It may be
			' there w ere no flags ready, but I went all about the town, and have no hesitation in saying that not every twentieth house or shop showed any signs of welcome. Here, again, those who did tried to make up for the indiference of the rest by crowding their windows with two and more flags.
			In an Austrian garrison town the lover of beer has only to follow the first artilleryman he meets, and he is sure to find out soon where the best beer is to be had. Here, if you are in want of refreshments, you have only to go in at the first shop with a flag. You wish for a tasse, and try the first shop with a flag outside. You have made &amp; mnistake, it is a liquor shop, where you may take your petit verre. AfterwardEsyouwantanhotel; lookup andsee whether there is a flag hanging out; the only mistake you can make is to go into the Hotel de Ville or to some nobleman's house. If you want a restaurant, pursue the same process, and all that can happen to You, if you have ill luck, is to go into a coiffeur's or barber's establishment.
			In the evening the baud of the National Guard played in the broad nameless street which intersects that leading to the Chateau, and the sound of its instruments soon brought out all that Chambsry possesses in servant and milliner girls,-whole coveys of them, mostly without, and some times with, one single man among them. It was a repetition of the crowd in the morning. To complere the picture I must not forget a number of shovel hats with grins under them. I had been so much accustomed of late to see under shovel hats faces long and thin as the edge of a knife, it did one almost goed to see that they had grown somewhat broader and shorter at Chambery. The illumination was tolerably general in the main thoroughfares, five candles in each window being the rulie. By 9 p.m.
			everyone was in bed.
			Thus, the great act of occupation is completed. As the troops will arrive they will be sent to the different Drovinces, whether into Chablais and Faucigny,�as the Swiss apprehend, who can tell? There are several crossroads, bad but passable, close to the descent from Mont Cenis; and why sbould not some detachment or other lose its way, if the Emperor should wish it ?
			The civil admlnistration of the Piedmontese still remains in a rather awkward position; so does the gendarmerie; they will probably remain until Par- liament sanctions the annexation. f am more and more convinced that the wishes manifested by the Savoyard members will be the only manifestation resorted to. Any other would be absurd now that the country is occupied. It is impossible that Sar- dinia should consent or the Emperor wish to outrage public opinion in Europe to such a point as to have a vote under these circumstances. It would be making a farce of the principle which he has adopted as the basis of his own power.
			There is only a little difficulty about the mem- bers of Parliament. In spite of the agitation of the French party, even in Lower Savoy, scarcely any voters come to the poD,-at Chambery out of 996 only 32a, one-third; in some electoral colleges three or four; and scarcely in any one of them the re- quired proportion of two-thirds. To-morrow there is a second election in the three districts, but I have heard nothing for this part.
			The fact is, now, when the decisive moment has come, even many of those who seemed glad of the change feel a pang and presentiment which makes them unwilling to contribute in any way to help events, while there are likewise traces of a feeling of regret at quitting the old connexion. That this is a sentimental more than an active feeling I need not tell any one who knows this good- natured people, accustomed to be ruled and directed. Their feeling is most clear]y indicated in the general dissatisfaction which the conduct of the Savoyards provoked who went to Paris.
			They returned yesterday, full of dinners, smiles, and promises. Even in this part of Savoy they are blamed for having offered Savoy to the Emperor and spoken in the name of their country. The Savoyards obey, as they have always done, their King, but they don't wish to belong to France. I am speaking of the great majority. They are against the dismemberment, because they have a strong Savoyard national feeling, which they wil find sooner or later in opposition to the new French national feelian which they ought to have.
			MAiedr 29.
			lo-day the Federal Assembly meets at Berne to consider the measures which are to be taken under the present critical circumstances. The general im- pression is that we ought to do as In the Neufchatel affair-give the Federal Council full powers to terminate this affair, and at the same time unlimited credit. This will be probably done to-day, without even a discussion. The occupation of Chambery, and the question on this side and the centre of it, is transferred to Berne. In reality the Savoyard question hasnever been in Savoy, but elsewhere-at Paris, Turin, and Geneva, but the last doubt in this respect has been removed since yesterday. You may place a cross on the map of Southern Savoy; it is French since yesterday.

			Jamaica advices are to the 10th of March. The House of Assembly stood adjourned pro form to the 27th ult., but it was pretty generaUy under- stood that a special session would be summoned to make the necessary arrangements for transfermng the Post-office Department from the Imperial to the Local Government, in conseqience of the decision come to at the Colonial-office. The Governor's health had much improved, and he had been able to attend to business at the King's House. It was nnderstood that Colonel Tidy would succeead ajor- General Bell, who was about to retire from the command of the forces on the Jamaica station. At the 41st half-yearly meeting of the share- holders of the Bank of Jamaica the direc- tors' report was adopted, the shareholders ex- pressing their entire satisfaction with the affairs of the institutlon. The directors, in their report, congratulate the shareholders on the favourable con- dition of the bank, and state that " the prospects of business for the present year are also good; fair prices continue to ruLle for our products, and in- creased crops are expected." A dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum was declared; which, when paid, will leave a saurplus on the half-year's business of 1,9961. 2s. Id., out of which it was decided to transfer 8421. 13s. 8d. in reduction of the freehold wharf premises, and the balance of 1,1531. 8s. 5d. to be carried to the reserved fund, which will then amount to 17,8041. 19s. 5d. Mr. MGregor, the emigration agent at Calcutta, had officially an- nounced to the Jamaica Government that he had made arrangements by which 350 emigrants were promised by the 2d of January last, and 2,000 by the end of March. This intelligence was considered to be very cheering for the planters, and a renewal of immigration was looked forward to as likely to he one of the most important incidents of the year 1860.
			Cordova's Mercantile Intdligenemr of the 10th inst. states that only a limited amount of business had been transacted during the previons fortnight, the demand having been very light, and only for imme- diate consumption, and in no way affected by specu- lative feeling. The arrivals, however, not having been sufficient to increase stocks materially, prices had bean generally maintained. Very little had also been done mn home prodncts. The supply of coffee was still limited, and all that had been brought to market was readily taken at 1s. to 44s. for common to good ordinary. There was very little pimento offering; one lot had been sold at 2'd. cash. Sugars remained as last quoted, sales having been made of dark at l6s. to 17s., and of fair grocery at 20s. per 1001b. A sale of 150 bags of East India rice was reported at 14s. Gd., and 400 bags to arrive had been placed at 14B. Patna, not strictly prime, was held for 18s. A lot of 500 bags of Rangoon was offered at auction and withdrawn at 13s., and 300 bags were subse- quently Bold at 13s. Gd. Irish butter. ex Planta- genet, had sold at ls. 4id. cash, and was offered freely at Is. 5d. 250 kegs American sold at 10d., and 200 firkins Halifax realized Is. per lb. Country corn was very plentiful, and had been purchased at 4s. to 4s. 3d. per bushel; nothing doing in Ameri- can. Sales of cornmeal had been made at 21s. for small quantities; a lot of 500 barrels was closed out at 20s., but this price was refused for 600 barrels received from Baltimore. The flour-market was very unsettled, the speculator who purchased about 5,000 barrels at 35s. having offered ro resell, in lots of 500 barrels, at the same figure. There was, however, very little inclination to purchase, and the only sales to report were of 120 barrels daufaged at 34s. Gd., and 600 barrels sound at 35s., both auction sales. Owing to the advance in value of pork in America, sales of mess had been made at 95s., and 25 barrels thin me3s were sold at 84s. Sales of beef, Smith's, had been made at 53s. to 54s.; other brands were not wanted. Ten casks of hams, ex Cyclone, sold at 10d. per lb.; York had realized 15d. Last receipts of alewives sold at 24s. per barreL Codfish was dull; retail sales of Halifax were at 16s. for tierces, and 22s. for boxes. Of the Newfoundland cargo sales had been made atl4s. 6d. for 25 to 50 tierces. The last sale of American cheese was made at 10d.; English had realized 13d. per lb. Prices of dyewood remained steady. Cod oil sold at 3s. per gallon, in cargo; of cocoa- nut, five casks sold at 4s. 9d., and of lard five casks
			sold at 5s. tid. Large arrivals of soap had taken place; but the demand was very limited, and there wero no sales to report. Exchanges on London.- Colonial Bank, 90 days, 1 per cent. premium; 60 days, 1i per cent. premium ; 30 days, 2 per cent. premium. Jamaica Bank, 90 days, 1 per cent. pre- mium; 60 days, Th per cent, premium; 30 days, 2 per cent, premiumn. MIerchants' Bills, 90 days, i premium to par.
			From Barbadoes we have intelligenco to the 12th uilt. The Globe and Bnrbadian newspaper establish- ments, which suffered soverely the fire on the 14th of February, had been enabled to resume operations by the kind assistance of the other jour- nals. The coroner's inquest ordered by the Go- vernor, though not enabled from the evidenco adduced before them to pronounce the fire as positively the act of an incendiary, felt warranted in deciding that the fire, if not wilful, was acci- dentally occasioned by an attempt to rob the pre- mises of Mr. John Alleyne. The Governor, on the jury's recommendation, had offered a reward of $1,000 for information that might lead to convic- tion, if the work of an incendiary. In a message to the Assembly, Governor Eincks, w;ho was on the spot and an eyewritness, ascribes the great loss of property to these causes :-1. The lumber and coal yards in the centre of the city; 2. The narrowness of the streets; 3. The want of organized fire com- panies; 4. The insufficient supply of water.
			"To these," the West Indian says,-
			"Shonld be added, besides the want of vigilance of the police in suffering the fire to barn for such a length of time unobserved, and to acqulre such a volume and intensity as to become utterly uncontrollable, the injudicious blowing up of honmes by the military."d
			Recapitulating the loss of lumber and provisions, the same paper states:
			" Thero were nine lumber-yards and about as many pro- vision-stores destroyed in the fire, in the former of which it Is calculated from 800,000 to 900,000 feet of white pine Inmber, from400,000 to 500,000 feet of pitch pine lumber, from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 shinglss, 200,000 staves, 15,000 molasses' pnncheons, from 800 to 1,000 tons of coal, besides a large quantity of woodhoops, nails, &amp;c., were destroyed. The provlsion stores, with one exception, were not of the first class, and the quantity of provisions destroyed was not equally great with that of lumber."
			A sum of 5001. had been voted by the Legislature for the relief of the destitute sufferers, and a public subscription for the same object, headed by Governor Hineks and several of the principal mercantile firms with $100 each, lay open at the Colonial Bank and the Treasurer's- office. The joint committee of the Council and Assembly appointed to consider the measures it maight be desirable to take to turn the occasion fairly to account for improving the city, especialliy with a view to increasing the fac'.Uties for shipping and trade generally, reported on the 28th of February. Their report was accompanied by two Bills, the iirst of which, to remove restrictions on the saie of cer- tain lands reserved for public use in the old Burnt District of 1845, and authorizing the Com- missioners to bring the whole of the district to sale, was passed at once by the House of Assembly and Eent up to the Council, who also passed it. The other Bill was forcarrying out the desored improvements in that part of the city recently burnt, and for the better secuifty of the city against fire. This waa read a fist time and ordered to be prxixjd, the House 1jour*g to that
			day week to consider it. At this meeting on the 6th ult the measure was discoased at great length, and several nmendments were introduced in com- mittee. The House met again on the following day to carry through the BiM, and passed it, after atriking from the clause prohibiting the re- opening of lumber or coal-yards in that part of the city recently burnt the words " lumber and," thus restrlcting the prohibi- tion to coal-yards only. Clauses proposed for ex- tending the prohibition as regards both lumber and coal-yards to other central parts of the city, and for restricting certain trades, for the better Eecurity against fire, were withdrawn, to be brought up in a separate Bil. The Council met on the 9th ulc. to receive the Bill, and some objectionable provislons as to the number of comrcssioners and the exclusion of lumber-yards from the prohibl- tive clause were rescinded. The BilL, lith these amendments of the Council, was to be again brought before the House on the 13th, the day after the packet sailed. The public health at Bar- badoes was generally good, although a few mild cases of smallpox were stiU reported in both town and country. The weather had been generally favourable, and thereaping of thecropproceededwith vigour throughout the country, the canes, for the most part, being still immature and yielding unsatis- factorily. The sugar, however, was of superior quality. Several ships had sailed with cargoes during the fortnight, and the exports amounted to 3,401 hhds. 192 trs. 382 brls. sugar; 132 puns. molasses; and 31 puns. 8 hhds. rum. The sabjoined trade report is from the Barbedoes Liberal:-
			" Since our issue for the 27th of February there have been two arrlvals of breadstuffs from the United States-the GazeUe and the Leni; the former left for a neighbouring island, and returned on the 3d insb., having disoh=ged only her deck-load of stock. Part of tho cargo of the Vas stored. SsIes of extr&amp; floor have been made at $74 to S7J, and Brandywine meal at $4 70c.

			" Cod6sh Is in supply. A cargo of Halifax lotted last week at $4, and one from Newfoundland has been taken on speculation. Three cargoes are offering to-day, one from Ealifax and the others from Newfoundland. large mackerel and alewives are wanted.
			" There have been several arrivals of W.P. lumber since the 27th ult. The majority of them saUed for other markets. The article Is in full supply, and sales at $20A to S2. There have been no late sales of P.P. Shingles are7wanted.
			" Exchange on London-Bank bUls at 30 days, $485 - 60 days, $482.'; 90 days, $480. Pxivaie bils, at 90 days, $475." -
			The Council of Government at Trinidad met on the 1st of March, but their proceedings presented no point of interest. Another batch of emigrants arrived on sanday, the 4th ult., in the ship Tyburnba, 71 days from Calcutta and 22 from St. Helena. There were 222 men, 53 women, and 20 children from the first-named place, and 78 captured Africans from the latter. "The disproportion of the sexes (says the Sentimel)
			"Is so exceodlingly great In thls Importation that we I cannot help thinking that that care and attention which have cbaracterized the selection of the emigrants of the first four batches for this season have not been exercised on this occa- slon. The number of deaths, 24-viz., 19 men, 2 women, and 3 chUldren-is comparatlvely large."
			The weather remained much the same-viz., alternate sunshine and rain. The crop was greatly behindhand, and complaints were general that the canes did not "yield." The consequence was that trade was dull and money scarce. Another whale had beaen caught since the last maJL
			The bishopric of Antigua, which had been offered to the Rev. Mir. Rawle, and declined by him, has been since offered to the Rev.W.W. Jackson, S.C.C., one of the Bishop's chaplains, and chaplain to Her Majesty's forces at Barbadoes.
			Lieutenant-Governor Ord intends, the Donicnmn says,
			" To pay a visit, on leave, to England, accompanied by hts respeeted family and his private secretary, by the first steamer that leaves in April. Drlng his Excellency's tem. porary absence Mr. Berkeley, the Colonial Secretary of Hon. duras will adaminister the Government of our island."
			Letters from Cantries to the 5thof March confirm the expectation entertained there at the date of pre- vious advices, that the St. Lucians would take up the Coolies which Governor Eineks had affected to hawk among the other islands. It will be remsmbered that eight or nine months ago two cargoes were distributed in St. Lucia, and it was soon after given out that two more for 1860 would satisfy its demand for labour, and accordingly two ships (the Victor Emmanuel and the Zemindar) were chartered in India. The planters, however, became In the mean- time dissatisfied with the M adras people received by one of the former ships, and an impression began to prevail that there would be some difficulty in disposing of the two ships expected this season, especiall from the fact that u to within three or four weeks of the arrival of the Victor Emma-nuel not more than 100 of the expected immigrants had been applied for by the planters. This state of things was, no doubt, communicated to Governor Hineks, and led to the offer which was made to the other colonies of one of the cargoes. But matters have taken quite a different turn. Acorrespondent wirites:-
			"Oar planters, well pleased on the one hand, with the Coolies by theVlctorEmmanue'i, and on the other roused to a sense of the detriment to the cause of immigration likely to arise from the transfer of the Zemindar to another colony, have sent in applications for the Immigrants daily expected by that ship, and it has been determined to retain her for St. Lucia."
			At DJemerara the Court of Policy met, pursuant to arrangement, on the 5th ult., to take up the annual estimate, and continued in session on that and the three foUowing days, during which the estimate was gore through and other matters dis- posed of. The items of expenditure remained pretty much the same as last year, with the exception of an increase in the items for immigration and public works, and the salaries of two or three officers which it was proposed to increase. A vessel, with Chinese immigarants, amongwhomwasabatchof women, being expected, members agreed, in reply to an inquiry of his Excellency, that two-thirds of the cost should be borne by the planters, and that nothing more should be expecred from the women than aresi- dence on the estates. The Attorney-General had intimatedhisintentiontosubmitto the Combined Court a proposition to deduct 5 per cent. from the salaries of al public officers, the same to be in- vested for their benefit, and to be returned to them with compound interest at 6 per cent. on their re- tirement from the pablic service, or, in case of their death, the same to be paid over to their families. The Governor, at the request of the elective mem- bers, submitted the draught resolutions for the new Civil List to the Court of Policy on the 8th ult., by whom they were favourably received. The Court proposed to Increase the salary of the Governor from 5,0091. to 6,0001. The salaries of the judges and other officers are to be placed upon the same footing as they were prior to the Civil List of 1853, when they were reduced. A resolution had also been carried to increase the salaries of the stipendiary magistrates to 7001. a-year; but his Excellency was rather in favourof consolidating several of the present districts, and giving to the magistrates under- takingr the duties of both salaries of l,OOl. a-year. It WaS also arranged that the Assistant Government Secretary shal act as Clerk of the Court of Policy and Combined Court, leaving the Government Secretary free to sit as a member, instead of being placed in the anomalous position of a member and clerk at the same time. This scheme of course re- quired the sanction of the Combined Court, but, as it had been introduced at the request of the elective members of the Court of Policy, and assented to by them, there was little doubt but that it would be adopted by the other Court. A letter had been received by Mr. E. Dalton, the colonial postmaster, from the Postmaster-General, announc- ing " that Hler Majesty's Government has como to the determination to place in the hands of the local authorities, on the 1st of May next, the control of the post-offices in all the WVest Indiau colonies; and that, from that day, you are to consider yourself the officer of the Colonial Government, and no longer deputy of Iler Majesty's Postmaster-General." His Excellency the Governor had shipped off eight of the French convicts who some time ago made their escape from Cayenne. The ship Schah Jehan, Cap- tain Cox, arrived on the 3d ult. from Calcutta, with 320 immigrants, after the unusually short passage of 75 days. Only nine deaths occurred during the voyage. The Royal GazetZe says:-
			" The ship Tartar, which not long ago brought a fallcom- plement of im nigrants from Madras without a single death ocenrring on the passage, has been chartered by 30 gentle- men of this city to go to St. Helena In the firt instance, and in case of need to Sierra L4eone, in search of captrecd Africans. Should the plan prove a failuro the enterprising charterers will have to bear the loss, but,If successful, the ex. pence will be defrayed by the colony, and the charterers mnaythen, in cons,derat'on of the risk they have incurred, have arferenca in obtaining the services of the i-mi. grants.�
			The, weather at Demerara had been fne during the fortnight, although showery, and favourable for the growing crops. The exports for the fortnight
			The improvement In business at St. Thoms'as8 re- ported by last mail, continued, causing more amma. tion in trade, and large sales of goods had been mado topurchasersfromadjacentislands, reducing stocks.

Rates of exchange were still declining, merchants' paper being more abund. ant, and sales had been effected at :-On London, $4 821c. for 90 days' sight draughts ; ditto, $4 85c. for 60 ditto; ditto $4 87ic. for 30 ditto; on Ham, burg, $42i to 4Ml for 90 ditto; on Paris, 516f. tq 520f. for 50 ditto; on United States, 1&amp; to 2 per cent N discount for 60 ditto.

			The GIrenada Roue of Assembly met on the 28th of February, but the se3sion was cut short in con' sequence of "no hou&amp;s' on the following dsy5 and adjourned till the 13th of March. A highly imDortant measure, initiated by a mem- ber representing large Bngicultural interests, and unanimously supported by the other mem- bers pres3ent, was a resolution to tho effect of raising by loan the sum of 2,0007., on the security of the immigration fund, to defray one-half of the expenses of introducing this year a second ship-load of Coolies to the island,-to meet which a Bill wr
			to be brought in for increasing the export duties, adding 4s. on sugar, makiing it lOs. per cwt, and tacking a proportionate increase on mo- lasses, rum, and cocoa. The depulty postmistrdes
			had received intination from the executivo that on the 1st of May tho control of Her Majestya Postmaster-General over the department In the colony would cease, and thenceforward devolve on the local Government. The public henlth continuedc satsfactory. Crop operations had been seriously interrupted by weather without a parallel in the recollection of the oldest planters of the islana. It had rained over the whole island, to the great detri. ment of fuel and carting, and certainly not to the improvement of the yield of sugar in the canes. There was, however, a large surface in young plants for futare crops, which would be benefited by this kind of weather, though doubts were entertained of its belng any countervailing advantage to the inter- ruption of sugar-maliag from the canes that wera already ripe. The cocoa growers suffered, too, from the impossibility of drying their produce for market.
			" We may note (says the Sf. Georqg's ChZronicle):- " That, owing to a newv order of the Royal hail Steam. pacLet Company, ery little, if ay, cocoa will In future be shipped at thls port by the steamers: 'It will onlly bc re. ceived,' the order sets forth, ' by the steamer which goes on to St. Thomas's rithout transfer at Barbadoes,' man there is no rule given by which It can be ascertained heforehanO which steamer wil be going on to St. Thomas's.

			Ir. B. COCERANB gave notice of his intention to -move on Monday for leave to introduce a Fishery Bill for Scotland.
			PUBLIC BUSINESS.
			On the order of the day for the third reading of the Income-ta= Bill being read,
			Tho CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said,-It may bo convenient that I should mention the order in which I propose to take the remaining financial business before the 2ecesa. I propose to-day to read a third time the two Bills on the orders-the Income-tax BiBl and the Stamp Duties BIll. On Monday I propose to commence with what are known as the Customs' charges resolutions; and after those to take the second reading of the Wine Licences BilL If not objected to I world also read a
			Eecond time the Bill for the repeal of Sir John Barnard's Act, if the House shall give me leave to introduce it So-day. It cannot pass this House til after the recess, but inasmuch as there Is a charge depending on it, I trast the House will espedite Its proresss much as possible. On Tuesday I should report such resoluti as the Committee on Customs' Acts may think fit to adopt on Monday, and insert them in the Customsa' Dodes Bill. There has been already Inserted in it a clause wit' respect to draw- backs on wine. It wiI be advisable that the BIll should then be reprinted, that It may be seen with all Its pro. 'isions as a whole; and when the House reassembles after the recess I will take a convenienr opportunity-not for several days after the meeting, however-of asking the House to put the Bill through the remaining stages. With respect to the Wine Licences Bil I reserve to myself liberty, presuming it be read a second time on Monday, of committiug It pro formd on Tuesday, with a view to certain amendments which it may be worth while to introduce. Several very good suggestlons have been made referring to matters of detail,-some to modifeietons of charge and some to provisions against the abuse of autho- tity-which I would Introduce; and as it may be *convenient for the House and for the pubUo likewise to see the BiU with these suggestions embodied, that Bill must le reprinted also. In Committee of Ways and Means it wil
			be my duty to ask for the charges on lcences, which are a mecessary supplement of the second reading of the Wine licences Bil and with respect to which I should have no chahnge to propose, escePt perhaps one or two minor adjust- menta in way of mitigation. These chargesZ If adopted by the Eiouse, would then be inserted in committee on the Bin en Taesday, that stage being taken psrc formd, and then hen, members would have the opportunity of seeing the whole measure in the precise form in which the Government Intend to submit it for the final consideration of the Homse. With this esplanation Sir, I beg to move the third reading of the Income-tax Bin.
			INCOME-TAX BILL.
			M,r. HENLEY.-I wish to call the attention of the Homse to the manner in which this particular Bin has gone on. It is a Bi of very great importance, and on Wednesday, after the hour when, ordinarily, public business is not pro. ceeded with if there be any dispute-because if there be the least question yon cannot go on, according to the forms of the House-a clause was introduced which had not been printed and which nobody knew anything about. I must enter my protest against that mode of conducting business on an important taxing Bll. I don't mean to say that the clause is an Improper one. It may be a very convenient way of granting the sort of tppeal given in that clause; bat I do protest agvinst clauses which are of consequence, whether for- good or evil, being Introduced Into Government Bins of such Importance when nobody knows anything about them. The right hon. gentleman shakes his head; but I would ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer was the clause to which I have referred printed ? Did anyboAy know anything about It? Was It not proposed after a quarter to 6 o'clock, when veryvone leaves the 0H sc supposing that nothing but routine business wl be pro- ceeded with? All I can say is, if it wera so, that is not the course which has ordinarily been followed. Before any clauses are introduced into a Bill, the common practice is to print them, that members may know what they are legislating upon. But that was not done tn this case. With regard to the Bin itself, I havenething to saysgainstits being
			read a third time; but I havec onsidered it my duty to call attention to this point, becanse I think that the observanc of the ordinary forms of this HSouse is not only a matter of great convenience, hut asoe of the greatest advantage to the conduct of publce business. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the order in which the business of the House is to be tak
			next week as sketched out by the right hen, gentleman, I have no objection to offer. Being quartersessins week many members who are connented with country business will not bo able to be here on Monday, and therEoreI shall hold myself free, H th eWine Licences Bil be read a second lime on Monday, to take any course I may think necessary In committee when that stage arrives. I am not eorry to hear that the rlght hon. gentle. man proposes to modify some provisions in the Bill * some nf them-and I especially refer to that clauso with regard to the interference of magistrates-are so objectionable in their present shape that they have been made the subject of much comment. I hope, however, to see them In a different guise when they come before us again. With these observa- fi0ns I do not object to the third reading of this BSIn; bnt I do hope that, in future, Sf clauses of an important nature are to be introduced into a Government Bill thecy will be pcrinted and notice given of them, sO that this House may snow what they are dotug. (Hiear, hear.)
			?{r. GRIHTITH.-I beg to corroborate the view taken of thls matter by the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxfordshlre. I must say I have seen commtmications pass between partles who carry on business at the table and those on the Treasury bench which were entirely inaudible in tho
			louset and which I afterwards found resulted in the inser- tion of clauses without any knowledge on the part of hon. members who took an interest In the subject, and whlch Lad they known of them in time, they would have opposed'
			The BI was then read a third time. On the motion that the BiU do pass,
			Th OCHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said,-I think itquiteright, Sir,thatall. matters appeztaining to the business of thia House should bo very strictly watched and criticized and I am always glad to hear such criticisms made; but the right hon. gentleman is not accurato in the state- ment he has made, as I think I can show. I have been indebted to the courtesy of the Hous1e on more occasions t.hn ono for consenting to pass a partlelar stage of this Bill, and postpone discusslon till a future stage, with a view to the general convenience of this and the other branch of the legislaturo. Nobodty can reproach the right hon. gen. tleman with Inattention to his Parliamentary duties. He is so constant in his at'endanco on the prccedings of thls House, as well as so valuable in the asslstance he gives in all publio matters, that occasional absence on his part is always auTo to be excunsable. But, Sir, I must state that the BiU was not brought on upon 'Wednesday after the timo when public business ceases, but before that time. It was con- eluded after the time when publie business ceases, but in the presenca-I don't recollect of vhat members-but of a num- ber who take an interest in the matter, and by whose con- sen's the BUll was carried forward, while it wv in the power of any ene o2 thcm, by a simple objection), to stop It.
			tnfact,toshowthatfuu noticewa taken of all thattook Tvlace i regard to the insertion of the clanse referzed to. I may mention that one hon. gentleman put the qestlon whether it could then be regurly Introduced, whioh was ruled in the affirmative. With re'gd to the clausa not having beenprzmted, the rem&amp;-L- may be eehnically correct, bat substatially it f' not so. It zrlakes to a point of relief raised by the hon. baronet the menmber for Evesham, who g,ave anotice, whieh u=pri'ntsed inthe vote, of a aelas for the purpose of giving an appeal, an what we preposed and Inserted In the Bill was really en amendment of his motion. Technically it was not the hon. baronvet's clause, for it wsr
			draw ned'Erenly,but it had the same object in view, votes caus n such cases3cannot always be printedIn the
			Mr. HENL;EY.-The rl'ght hen, gentleman says that the hon. baronet the member for Evesham gave notice of such a clause; but I don't think that, ordinarily speaking, the Hlouso would suppose because any member gave notice of a clause therefore the Government were going to adopt it; or, adopting Its spirit and principle, would bring up a clause of the same kind. Members are not generally so fortunate in gettin g the cemsent of Government to amend taxing Bi'ls. (Iear, hear.) All I can say 1s, that when the Government make up their mi,nds to amend a Bill inany particular It wvould be wrell to print the clause or clauses proposed to be inserted in the usutal manner, and then there can" be no objection.

			STAMP DUTIES BiML.
			The CHANOELLOR of the EXCHEQUR hvIng moved the third reading of the Stamp Duttes BM,
			Sir H. CAIRNS sald,-I wish, Sir, to7 draw your attention to a questlon which arises on this BuMin relation to the forms of the Homse, which I think it Important Ehould not be overlooked. I would ask whether there Is not an irregu- larity In the Bill which strike3 at one of the most important privileges of this House. We know very well that nu tax can be imposed on the subject unless founded on resolutions of the whole House In committee. One tax proposed by this Bill Is on contracts for the sale of stock. Now, there was a resolution of the House In committee upon that sub- ject, but that was a resolution to this effect,-that, provided the Act which is caUed Sir John Barnard's Act be re- pealed, thera Ehould be imposed on contracts for the sale of stock a certain duty. That resolution havlng passed a committee of the whole Houso, Involving a condition pre- cedent-namely, therepealof Sir John Barnard'sAct.-a Bill
			was antroduced containing a clause proposing to repeal the Act; and by the Eame Bil It was proposed to impose the dauty on contracts for the sale of stoclk. We had last nlght a discussion on that clause, the result of which was that It has been withdrawn, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given notice of the introduction of a BiU to repeal Sir JohnBarnard's Act. The matter, therefore, stands thus: -That Bill has not yet been introduced; Sir John Ba- nard's Act has not been repealed ; and In this Bill which Imposes a stamp on contracts for the sale of stock, there i5 no condition precedent; it is a positive Imposition of a stamp dity on aU persons who deal in stock, the condition precedent not having been complied with. The question I would sabmit to you, Sir, with great respect, is this, whether the Bil, so far as It proposea to Im- pose a tax on the sale of stock1, Is warranted by the resolution of the Hense. I respectfuly submit that It Is not. I contend that until Sir John Barard's Act be repealed It is not competent to the House, under this resolution, to In- pose a tax upon these contract notes; and I therefore submit that the proper course for the Government to pursue is to strike out of this Bil the words which refer to contracts for the sale of stock, and to deal wlth that subject hereaftsr either in another Bill or in that by which It ia proposed to repeal Sir John Barnard's Act. If that Act be repeed the resolution of the House will warrant the imposition of this tax.
			The SPEAKER.-On referrlng to the resolation I find that It was a providonal and conditional one. The terms are, " Provided that the Act passed in the seventh year of the reign of King George IL shaU be repealed," and so on. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. DODSON naked whether a stamped form would be provided for certified extracts from the registers of bap- tisms, marriages, and buials.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-The Com- misdloners of Inland Revenue wiU be required to provlde both impressed and alhesive stamps for such documents; but I am not aware that we have any power to compel the use of a particular form of words. I am much obliged to the hon. and learned gentleman, who is, I think, quite correct in his statement, that a condition was Inserted in the resolution which, owing to the omission of the clause repealing Sir J. Barnard's Act, is not now foUowed in the BilL When we last night eame to the conclusion that, In deference to the privileges of the House of Lords, it wonld be better to deal separately with the subject of that clause, I did not observe that an amendment would consequently be required in the schedule. The hon. and learned gentleman has pointed out that necessity at the most seasonable time and I shall proposa to withdraw the motion for the third reading of the Bil, and to recommit It, in order to insert in the sehedule words which will affx to the imposition of the tax the same condition as was originally specified in the resolution.
			Sir HL CAIRNS.-Contingent taxation! You can't do that,
			The CHA.NCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I don't know that. It appears to me to be clearly within the powers of the House, and I am not prepared to admit that a tax which isto accrue upon a certain contingency i: a novelty In any sense. I shal, therefore, proposa to go through the necessarydforma of recommitting the Bill, with the view-if that, Sir, meet your approval as a matter of order-of bringing the schedule into exact conformity with the resolution.
			The SPEAKER.-As to the matter of foirn, there have been many occasions upon which a elmilar course has been pursued. The order must be discharged, and the BiU be re. committed. As to the matter of substance it does not come within my province to give any deciion.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER then moved that the order for the third reading of the Bill should be dischargedt
			Mr. HENLEY hoped that If the Blli had to be recom- mitted it would be reprinted. Amendments had been Intro- duced which it was very desirable that the House should sec (hear, hear). and as It would occasion no delay he trusted the Chancellor of the Exchequer would accede to his sug- gestion.
			Mr. DISRAELT-Thls is not a mero matter of form, because the principle of contingent taxation is a moat im. portant one. I am not at this moment prepared to say that there may not be precedents for its adoptlon, but at the same time I have not them at hand. Taxation is always founded upon an estimate submitted by the Minister for the service of the year, and aU propositions for taxation bear a relation to that estimate. If the principle of contingent taxation he admitted, we may find that our expendi- tare and our revenue do not balance. This is there- fore not a matter of form merely, but involves r most Important principle. I assume, as a matter of course that we shall not be asked to go into committee on the Bill to-day. Even as a matterof form, notice of the recom- mittal would be required, ;but, as a principle of great im- portance is involved, I take it for granted that time will be given to us to make ourselves thoroughly acquainted with the subject, so that we may bring to the committee the re- sult of the reflection and inform3tion which are so neces- sary.
			Tho ATTORNEY-GENflAL.-I cannot understand the importance which has been given to this matter by the speeches of hon. members opposite. Thero is no unestion of contingent taxation at issue. All that wiU be proposed to the House wfil be to adapt the schedule to the language of the resolution. If any objeotlon attaches to contingent taxation, it Is one which applies to your own reso- lution. Your own resolution is framed in these words; " Provided the restrictions on dealings in the publio funds" contained in a certain Act shall be repealed then "for and upon every note," there shall be a certain stamp. We propose nowr to put into the schedule precisely the same words a3 were adopted in the resolution of the House,-" that, provided the restrictions in dealings in the public funds contained in the Act of so-and-so shal be repealed by any Act passed in the present session, then from and after such repeal thesedutles shall attach." Therefore thereis not the smallest objection in point of princlple, unless that objection be carrled to the extent of affirming that your own resolutlonwas umconstitutional and impropar.
			;tr zt. UALKN .-No doubt the Attorney-General has not the least objection to that which Is proposed, but there is a graver question-whether there Is not an objection to it founded upon the forms of the House. I venture to say that tho objection does not apply to tho resolutlon. A resolution {a in its naturo temporary and provisional, merely to stand unt-I a Bill is brought in and passed, and therefore the object of thls resolution being framed as it is Is to show that it is intended to introduce the Bil which is referred to as a condition precedent before you introduce the BiU imposing the tax. (Hear, hear.) That which the resolution savs in effect is this :-" Let there be a BI passed In this session repealing Sir J. Barnard'e Act, ana then let a BIll be brought in and passed which will impose a tax upon contract notes; and I venture to think that no precedent wiU he found in which a Bill has pased this House imposing a tax not directly and ab- solutely, but upon a certain cottingency, which is a speca. lative contingency that Parliament will do something else by some other BIIL If there be such a precedent there may he no reason why we should not foUow it, but if there be not, it wonld be a most inconventent and irregular practlice to introduce upon the present occasion, and one about wbich there will be a great deal to be said. I understand that the motion for the recommitment of the BiU cannot bh made until a future day. When we seo the words which It is proposed to Insert in the schedule, and the precedents which the Govement, if It can fid them, will then bring forward, vviU be the tlme to consider the proposition. In the meantime, I ap- prehend that the Houme would not think it advisable, vith. out notice and witheuit precedent, to adopt sc a pr'oDosal at once. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. T. M. GIBSON.-The hon. and learned gentleman iS mistaken when he alleges that a resolution relating to the imposition of dnUtes is in all cases a merely temporary arrangement and provision, Lasting only unti a Bill is brougnt in. In the caso both of Customs and Excise the duties are levied immediately upon the resolution being p2ssed. (Hear, hear.) I contend that when yon agreed to the resolution in this instance you affirmed the principle of contingent taxation. i you chooEoothdedceibe it. Theo ob.
			jesctons ought-to haTa been taken at that tine. I am in- fnned that if the oourse which ha been suggted by my right hon. frlend is not adopted, it wi prolong the dtting of the other Houe of Parliament, a4c wUIl lead to much In- convenience. I cannot see that this is anytg more than a tecnlcal objection,to which an importance has been given which it does not deserve, annd I hope that there lill be no farther opposition to the course proposed by my right hon. friend.
			nr. JAME salad that thts wAs Ptan emample of the ineon- venience which had been c%used by the hurrried manner in which this Bill had been passed through the House. The rezolution was a conditional one, providiing that in a certain eveIn this tax shoSuldho levied. That even3t ba not ocCUrred, And therefo-e the provislon failed. (Hear hear.) He joined the right hon. gent|eman-the member for 6ixord- Whire In his earnest request that the Bi might be reprinted with its amendments. Those amendments had been made at so late an hour that It conuld not be expeoted thatadequate attention wonld be gaid to them by members of that House, or that they would ha oommunicated in detail to the public. Ion. members were now reaUy ignorant of the extent of the Bil, and he therefore hoped that there would be no objection to Its being reprinted.
			Mb . J. eWART albo recommenaed that the Bill should be printed In its amended shape.
			Mrz. LAING said that the amenclments which had been referred to as having been Introduced Late on the previous evening were only three in numoer, and were intended to meet objections which hadl been raised principally by the hon. andlearned member for Alarylebone. These amend- ments (which the hon. member explained) were of a surely tehn ical nture eanzd td,id n�ot affect theh general opera on oyf
			under it would amount ato Ca2boutalt 1 . au daytoandthus if its becoming lawweredelayeduntilater Easter, thecountry would lose about 14,000!.
			Mr. S. FITZGERALD said that what the House wanted to know was whether the amendments fully met the objec- tions which had been raised. It wonld be better even to lose 14,000!. to the publio revenue than to pass the Bill without proper consideratlon. (Hear, hear.)
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXOHEQTJER.-I do not accede to the doctrine of the blon. and learnel gentleman opposite, but, as no serious loss to the revenue will be in- volved, I am prepared to meet his objection by withdrawing [from the Bill the part of the schedule which refera to con-
			tac note.
			Sir EL CAIRN S.-That is what I suggested.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUJER.-I didi not uinderstand that. Well, then, I will omit from the schedule the words relating to contract notes, and leave the whole question to be dealt with In a subgequent measure. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the reprinting of the Bill, I may observe that the amendments which have been madeo have been deslgned only to remove from the Bill certain words with respect to which it was suggested that difficulties might arise, and to siter the rranements as to the cancel- ling of stamnp rInncertain cases. X a the Bil Is requlredto be reprinted it wll cause delay and consequtent loss to the
			r venue, an3 I therefore hope that the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxfordlhire wi nut Insist upon seeing the amendments in print before the Bil passes.
			Mr. HENLe Y said that when he badi sugg etted that the Bi should be reprinted he understood that it ea to he re- committed on a ftutre day, and that therefore its printing would cause no delay. As that course was not to beadopted, his observations did not apply.

			SIR JOEh N BARNARD'S ACT.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEA moved for leave to brinig In a Bill to repeal the Act 7 George Ir., cap. 8, cemcaoniy coiled Sir John Barnard's Act, anLd the Act 10 George If., cap. 8, which mande the former Act perpetual.
			Mr. WISE, before the Bill was brought in, wished to have some explanation of the reasons for proposig it. Sir John Barnard's Act was intended for the prevention of stockjobbing. The puLrchase and sale of stock were per. foetly legitimate operations, but the Hence would desire, no doubt, to discourage gamabling In the funds. Sir John Bar. nard's Act had been found to work so well that it had been rendered perpetual, and he wished to know why it was now sought to repeal it.
			Mr. JAMES statedl that the 8th and 9th VIctoria, cap. 109, commonly called the Gaming and Wa-ering Act, had been held in all the courts to render iIegal oIl gambling transactions on the Stock Exchaknge or elsewhere. T'hen why did the right hon. gentleman wish to repeal Sir John Barnard's Act any mere than any other similar Act, unless he meant to derive a revenue from wagering trans- actions on the Stok Exchange? Such bargains would be licesdb he Imposition of a duty on them, and if that ruewr obe applied to the Stock Exchange, why not also to Tattersall's? Every one knew what occurred on the turf.

			IRELAND.
			AGRTC1aIIIUUAL AND EM1GiFATION ISTLIuICS.
			ilMON OUi. OWN COcYONDMiT.)
			DUBLIW, SATUBDAS 0IMO-MIS.
			TheRegistrar-(eneral(21r. JJoneUly) issued yester- day his tables, showing the estimated average pro- duce of crops for the year 1859, aud the em1gra- tion from Irish ports from the lst of January to the 31st of December, 1859. The tables ara introduced in a report addressed to Iis FEcellency the Lord- L-eutenant, explanatory of the system adopted in the collection of the information they contain, and
			,iving a kind of statlstical analysis of the produce, dcc. From these returns it appears that there was a great diminution in the yield of the crops in 1859, compared with the previous year; the cereals produced less by 1,183,519 quarters. Potatoes show a decrease of 562,702 tons, or about sufficient to supply every family in Ireland (averaging five persons to a family) with a stone of potatoes each day for nearly two months and a-half; turnips show a reduction of 902,717 tons, mangold-wurtzel of 96,477 tons, cabbage of 51,487 tons, and hay of 379,227 tons. The only crop which shows an in- crease is the important one of flax, which yielded 3,994 tons above the produce in 1858, but this was owing to 44,636 acres more having been sown in 1859. This decrease in the average yield of all the crops in 1859 may be attributed to the extreme dry- ness and high cemperature of the season, the weather having been for a long period unusually hot, and rain not havingr fallen for a considef'able time, and also to the decrease in the acreage under tiUlage. It appears from other returns furnished that the rates of produce per acre in 1859 were lower than the average of ten yo3rs-1850 to 1859-for every crop with the exception of wheat. lKotwithatanding tius great diminution, the corn crops produced for the consumption of each family in the country, allowing five to each family, 212 stones for the year, or about 81b. daily, and the potato crop wae equal to nearly 221b. daily for the same number of persons. The subjoined passage from the report is of interest, as showing that in the face of the generally admitted prosperity of the country the ex;odus of the Irish peasantry continues undiminished:
			'lBe emigration trom Irish ports during the past year exceeded that of the previous one by 16,506 persons, 68,093 having left the country in 1858, and 84,599 in 1859; of this latter amoant 46,431 were males and 38,168 females. These include 2,679 males and 1,321 females, or 4,000 persons who did not belong to Irelmnd, leavlng the remaining 80,590 to represent the emigration of the Irish during 1850. Owing to the continued want of a general measure for the registration of births and deaths in this oountry, it was necessary in the computations to use the averages of these events in England and Wales,ss given in the reports of the Registrar-General. The births are therefore assumed to have been one to 31, and the deaths one to 45 of the population in each year. It is greatly to be regretted that there are not mere atisfactory data upon which to base this important and interest- ing calculation; and it is earnestly to be desired that this session of Parliament may not pass over without supplying so great a want In the social leglslation of this part of the United Kingdom, which presents the strange anomaly of being the only civilized country in the world In which the births, deaths, and marriages of the in- habitants are not systematically recorded.. According to the computation there would appear to have been in Ireland on the 1st of January of the present year 5,988,820 persons, being 563,565 less than at the time of the censu of 185L This estimate, however, should only be considered an approximation, as the immlgrants who have settled per- manently in this country since 185. are not taken into ac- count, and the number of the births and deaths durlng the period has been obtained byusng the English averages. The emigration continues to be chiefly composed of persons between the ases of 5 and 55 years ; thus In Leinster 93 5 In Munster 92-3, in Ulster 91-4, and In Connaught 953 in every 100 persons who emigrated were between these ages. The proportion who left the entire country at these ages was 92 2 per cent., whUie those aged from 15 to 45 included 8019 in every 100 emigrants. Of the entire number of emi- grants the largest proportion was from the county and city of Cork, w;hichcontributed morethan 12 per cent, of the total emigration. The other counties and cities in Idonster aiso g3vo a large proportion, owing to which it would appear that this province lost a grea3ter number of Its inhabitants by emigration since 1851 than either Lemsater EUlster, or Connaught."'

			Lord Seaton left the Royal Hospital at 1 o'clock yesterday, for Kingstown, where he embarked on board the mail steamer for Holyhead. He drove in his private carriage, and was escorted by a troop of the 1st Royal Dragoons. His lordship was ac- companied by Lady Seaton, the Hon. Colonel and Mrs. Colborue, the Hon. ses Colborne, and Cap- tain Moore, A.D.C. The pler at Kingstown wvas crowded with persona anxious to have the privilege of bidding adieu to this deservedly respected noble- mass previous to his departure from Ireland. A. fewF hours later in the afternoon it became known that Lord Seaton's long and meritorious services, civil aud military, had won for him the coveted priz9 of a marahal'a hat,n

She was known to possess a considerablo amodint of prbperty, parzt of which came to her as the survivor of two sisters, from her brother the oldl Squire John Weary, who was well known for hsis eccentrici'ty throochout Comnwall. After AMis Weary's death, her room, Alech no one had been al- lowed to enter for 10 years before, wa-s searched, and about 9,0001. was found in the room. 8851. was found in cash, and some rolls of notes of the East Cornwall Bank, which had been out of the bank-, if not in circulation, for 36 years. Several hundlreds of pounds were found wtrapped up in cotton, and a utensUl was fell of sovereigns. Two packets of notes were found with 1,0001. in cash, andt some thousands wvere found in the bedltick-, and some of the money was so dirty that it had to be washed. Nearly a cartload of papers were found, and among them a grot number of 10 U's; mony, we are informed, out of date.

			STATE OF TRADE.
			BIRM? GGHAM, IMACRa 3L-The trade of this town oontinues inactive; fore, fortnight or thrte weeks the orders coming}nhave been smallInsufficient to enable tho manu. fasturem to keep their worlipople on at foil time, but they have done so pto thistmey reasono�the orders which had previouel1 accumulated in their books. It Is the country trade in which the fal-off has taken salice, andi tint quiest is, perhaps, no more than wouLld be sure to fellow the brisk trade we haeve had for between three .and four months. The fancy trades have been most affeoted in some of the more Important stapletrades there is still a good amount of business doing, especielly with such of the manufactarers as have an extensive foreign connexion; few, if any, of the manufacturers are makdng Igoods for stock, but are going on quietly in the execution of orders whilch are coming in daily. The factors who are best informed ss to the pros- spects of the home trade, as far as this distict is concerned, report favourably in relation to them; and after the Easter holydays are over it is most likely that some reaction will take place. Up to this period, the end of the first quarter of the year, the state of trade in this town has afforded matter for much congratulation, scarcely lessened by the slight languoor whioh now prevails. But the number of trades carried on here is so great end the branches so muliftarlous, that it is at aU times difficult to obtain accurate information as to the state of trade gene- rally; and the Chamber of Commerce, although it has been in existence many years, has never yet made shy report relative to the condition of trade in the loa- lity. A few days ago a circular was received from the Board of Trade by the Chamber of Commerce in this district instituting inquiries relative to Articlel of the French Treaty, and seeking Information so far as it affected those branches of the British export trade in which this district is more especially interested. The Committee of the Privy Council of Trade desire to be informed upon three points :-first as to the classification which it would be desirable to aAopt In respect of such manufactures, with the view to assessment by weight in the French tsriff; secondly, en to the average price of each clasa of manufaotures, with reference to such lassification; thirdly, upon what descriptien of each clss of geeds It is more especially important that the duties should be reduced below the maximum of 30 per cent. ad valem, or the ad raorem rate be taken es a basis on which to assess specific duties, and upon what special grounds such reductions are important. It is further no- ticed, that the 13th artIcle of the FrLaeh Treaty provides that the average price of the articles of British produce and manufactures enumerated In the treaty during the six months preceding Ithe sgning of the treaty shall be taken as the basis in fisxng the amount of the import duty upon them. The Council of theChamber of Commerce have asked for information on these points, and it has been suggested that deputations from some of the departments of the trades of this town should visit Paris on the subject of the treatv
			BRADFORD, 31sr.-Considerable flatness has prevailed in our market for wools during the past week. The amount of transactions has been inconsiderable, but brIght-haired qualities of wool remain firm in price, and the stacks in the staplers hands are not heavy. Nolls and shorts stlll seU readily, at previous rates. In the worsted yarn trade there Is a paucity of new operations. Purchases have been mnade only for immediate requirements, and tho result Is that the business done during the week has scarcely amounted to an average. Spinners, however, continue fairlyemployed npon contraots entered into some time ago, and in prices there is no quotable alteration. The demand far pleces has been rather languid since our last report. Ldess business is uually done on the last marketday in the month than on other market-days, hut the epsech of Lord John Rus- sell in the HIouse of Commons onl Monday evening, re specting the annexation of Savoy to France, has tended to wveaken confidence in the maintenance of peace, and in- cined men of business here to abstain free entering into fresh engagements of magnitude at present. This remark applHes more especially to the houses engaged in the conti- nental trade. The home trade merchants have lately had some reason to complain of the accumulation of atocks of fancy goods in their hands, owing to the prolonged winter; but within the last few days they have been able to dispose of such fabrics rather more freeJy, and, the weather having becomeomilder, there is now a better prospect of spring goods being cleared off. In cotton yarns only a very mode- rate amount of business has been done, and the demand has been almost entirely confined to the low numbers of double yarns, vrhich are rather scarce in the marLet, and command extreme sate.. Fine double yarns anda the, other descrip- tions suitable for the stuffmanufacture are quite fiat. The CouncU of the Bradford Chamber of Commerce have iust held a speoial meeting to consider a communication re- ceived from the Board of Trade relative to the new French tariff of impost duties upon articles the produce and manu- facture of the united kingdom enumerated in Article 1 of the treaty of the 23d of January 1860. After discussing some polnts upon which the Boardr of Trade requested infor- mnation in connexiion with the branches of the Brittsh ex- port trade in whitch the district represented by the Chamber is more especially interested, the meeting passed the follow- ing resolutions -
			* t. That this Ohhsmbar. havlng considered the French Conmercil Treaty, deores to erprees a strong o60'ioa that no Lpeeffis duties can with any degree of faorness be levied by the Trench Government with rcgasd to the manufeotesers of thi distrirt, but that an ad valorem duty ttheonlyonothbatanbeequitably eed. 2. Thatanyaoue. ment of duty based upon tho prices for the last dx months would be mo3t unfair, inasmuch a. these prlces have been much higher than for the average of meety preced Ing yeax"
			A committee was appointed to draw up a statement founded on these resolutions, and to submit such statement to another meeting, in order that it may be approved and forwarded to the Board of Trade as the reply of the Chamber to the letter received from that Board.
			DUBLIN, 30ri-Trade In Dnblin is still rather languid, especially in some branches of the retail trade, and the in- crease of disconet Is calculated to produce a somewhat un- favourable effect. However, business is sound and credit is well matntained.
			HALIFAX, 31ST-Threrhas been a little more animation In both the worsted and carpet trades,and also inthe woollen trade, this week. In all branches the hands are now fony employed. Indeed, in some departments hands arewanted. The fancy goods department Is very active, and the stocks are in a moderAte compass. StiU the absence of warm genial wreather retards purchases. Yamns are firm in price, and the demand, forcign as wcU ashome, is slighstly increas. ing. There has been rather more business done in wool this week, but there is no alteration in prices, which are very
			HUDDERSFMELD, 31ST.-Tlhe wooUen trade, both in the public markct and at the warehouses, this week has been rather quiet, buyers having purchased wiith caution, and not to a very large extent. Fancy trouserings suitable for sprint and summer, and Bedford cords and steel mixtures of various shades, have been the principal fabrics sold. Thc rep orts fro m the manufactu rers in the smorounding di str,ict are aof a satisfactory character. Many ofthe manufac- turers are preparing for the autumn trade, and have good orders on hand. Wool contmnues steady and firm in price.
			LEEDS, S1ST.-The woollen manufacturers in this tow,n .and neighbourhood are in full work, but sales of cloth are not very brisk, and there Is a gradual accumulation of some kinds of goods such as light mantles. The weather still continuing coid, spring goods go but slowly into wear ; hence the dealers and drapers are not supplying themselves with new stocks, except to a limited extent. The markets in the cloth-bais to-day have been of a moderate character, and they have lacked animation, and the bulk of cloth re- moved from the hals at the close of the day was compara- tively small. In general prices of cloth are firm, and the same may be said as to those of wooL The flex trade is steady, and for yarns and other productions there is a good demand. The raw material is scarce, and high in price.
			LEICESTEPR, 31ST.-The hosiery trade isinmost de- partments in a healthy and satisfactory state. There is a fair amount of business doing, and as soon as the weather becomes moro seesonable light goods will be in request. The operatives generally are woll employed, and wages are as gocS as for some time past, Yarns continue In fair re- quest, at unaltered prices. The wool-market maintains its frmness, material selling at very high prices.
			MANCHESTER, 31sT.-The aggregate of the week's business has again faUen short of expectatlon, owing to the uLncertainty excited by political events. Purchase for Gecr- many, especillUy, have on this account been greatly re- stricted, However, there is rather more confidence than at the beginning of the week, and, though the transactions have not been heavy, there has been s moderate demand daily, and prices are almnst withouLt exception held with great sirnmess. Domestics of most kinds continuec quiet, hut steady, and thscame remark applies to printing cloth, The demand for 40-inch shirtings is not quite so great as it was some days since but their valne is unchanged. 36-Inches have been in limited demand, but are also firm. The demand for yarns, though not active, is pretty general, and a moderate amount of business has been done at tolerably fnU rates, especially in water twist in the bundle and warps for export. Purchasera for home conenmption have ope- rated wlth great caution, but the spinners with whom they have to deal cre too well engaged with previous orders to make any concession in their terms. Pincops generaly are rather depressed. The operative cottonspinners of Bolton having demanded 10 per cent, advance In wa.ges, the masters have agreed to an lncreasee of 5 per cent., which the e
			accept for the present, intending to apply again for the other S per cent., if trade continues good, ,a feiy Eonha hecec. t s&lt; *=-&lt;;-
			XEWOASTLE_O1N.-TNE S1STr.-Though the genera trade of tho distriot has not been verry buoyant thin week, shipping freights are more firm; thefollowing are quoted
			Genoa, 231. 10s. to 241. ; Naples 23'. lOs - Ale2exandria,
			241.; Constantinople, 20l.; Hamburg,&amp;. lis. Od. Durtn the last ten days alarge amount of tonnagehasbeen engaged for Aden. In consequenco of the north winds, which de- tain ligbt vessels, coal freights from the Tyne to London are Gs. Cd. or ton. ; 141 vessels have cleared hero for over sea since this day week, and 213 vessels, with 42,251 tons of coals, for London and conatwise. The American timber trade promises favourably for shipping this e.a-son. Quebec freights are quoted at 31s. Sd. to the Tne,Wear, or Hartie- pool. Notwithsetandng the hafd winter 'hat has boo experienced on the coast of Northumberland, and the great loss of seamen belonlging to the seaports, pauperism is steadily on the dewrase. The re- turns of the Tynemouth Union show that last week 2,697 out-door paupers were on the books, as comppared writh 2,311 In the same week of last year, and thAt in the preceeding week there were 2,723 as compared with 2,797 in 1859. The collierses in South Durhamn are nearly all well employed, generally faul time ; and the iron manu- facturers in Clevdland keep busy. The Normauby furnaces, near Mfddlesborough, are fast approaching completion, and the Clay-lane iron Company are building another furnace, and contemplate greater extensions. Allessrs. Whitwell are also building three new furnaces at Stookton. Large quanti- tics of cotton goods from the manufacturing districs con-
			tiue to be shipped on beard steamers at West; Hartlepool for Hamburg and P,otterdamn. Iron shipbulilding is very active at Steskten and on she banks of the Tees, and there

			SEEB IEIJD, 31S.-The3 saw trade ha continued ilowly to improve for some wee1ks past. NZetrly all the makeen ara employed, and the numboer of grinders "on the box' is much smailer than some weele ago. The orders are chle5
			for the home trade. The filo manufactulrers sre also welt employed, chiefiy in the better qualit'ies of work= for the home and Continental markets, and the eleetro-pelated an&amp; Britaunia metal manufaeturers are generalliywell suppllet with orders. Some few of the crinoline steel manurfactozer oomplain of a little falling off in orders, but the steel trd generally is deciedely brisk, and difficulty is erperlenoedin

			WOLVER AtTPTO, 3lsT.-Theiron trade of Sout1h Staffordshire is unquestionably quiet. All but a few of thet leading makers are sbort of orders, and lower rates than the official list must be accepted by them in order to obtaIRj contracts.

			MONEY-MRKZTandOITYINTEBLLrGENCE.
			SATDAY EVaV\WG.
			The total collapse of the confidence bubble just blown on the Paris Bourze caused the Engliah funds to open this morning with increased heaviness, but tchere was subzequently a better feehng. Consols for money were first auoted 936 to 94, whence an adtance speedily took place to 94 to i, which was well sustained to the close. For the May account the final quotation was 94Q. The Rupee stocks again experienced a fall of a quarter per cent., and are now nearly 2 per cent. below the highest point recently touched, the last bargains belng at 9?k to j for the Five per Cents., and 103k to i for the Five-and-a-Half per Cents. India Stock left off at 218 to 221; India Five per Cents,, 104 to �; Tndia Bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequer- bllBs, 13s. to 179. premium.
			In the discount-market the demand to-day was nmabated, and on the Stock-Exchange loans were In request until the dividend at 4- per cent.
			Foreign stocks have again been flat, especially Turkish SiX per Cents. The latter cloaed 60 to A new, and 78 to i old. Chilian Six per Cents. were ;egotiated at 102 ex div.; Mexican, for the ac- Count, 21 and 20j; Ruasian Five per Cents., 107i; ,Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97 and 96; Sardinian
			Spnish Deferred, 34k; Passive, 14k Turldsh SnLXper Cents., 78 ; for the account, 78 and i; New Loan, for the account, 60 ; Be1gian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97k; and DItch Four per Cent. Certificates, 101.
			The Scrip of the New Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Brazilian Loan is at 11 to discount, bringing the actual price of the stock to about 862,f or 8 per cent. JDelow the quotations of the old Four-and-a-Half per Cents. two or three months back, and showing a dlifference of 10 per cent. compared with Russian rour.and-a-Half per Cents., notwithstanding the position of the finances of the latter country. The yield of this loau at its present price would be about E1. 4s. per cent.
			The last price from Paris this evening was 69f. 15C., showing a recovery of a little more than a quarter per cent.
			Another small sum in gold was taken from the Bank to-day-about 11,0001.
			The Parana has arrived from the West Indies with 536,000i., of which 48,0001. is in gold and 488,0001. in silver. In the latter is Included the amount, nearly 400,0001., brought by the Pylades from the West Coast of Mexico. The New York is 2.1o announced, with 25,0001., and the Tyne, at lisbon, from Brazil, with 7,0001.
			The advices from New York to-day show no mate- ral alteration in the rate of exchange. The ten- dency wag towardls firmness, but a resumption of pecle remittances was not likely to be commenced till the lst of April, when the summer scale of inmr- Anco charges comes into operation. Several conslgn- ments of rough ore from the silver mines lately dis- Covered in California had been received at New York, and were alleged to yield 6001. per ton. A !isa lhich had occurred in railway stocks is partly 2.ttlbutable to the Bill for the taxation of railways Jn New York State having been considerably modi- fied. It was propoed also to give the New York Central Company power to make an increase of 20 per cent. in their passenger fares. Numerous cases continue to be renorted in the law eennto of
			Attempted repudiation of guarantees by the muni- tlpalities of Western tows fn one instanco the jIea for non-payment was that the railway company
			changed its name since the guarantee was granted. In the State of New York a grant for ilty railways alleged to be worth 200,0001. had Deen voted by the Senate to Dr. George Law, and wholesale charges of corruption are levelled in heajournals at all concerned. The Bill was subse- quently lost in the Assembly. The .New York Times observes, in relation to It, that the great mass of the American people are stolidly indifferent to the -profs of corruption on the part of their representa- tives. "It seems to be taklen for granted. and to whatever extent it may be carried it excites no astonishment and arouses no special indignation." The United States census to be taken this year is expected to be completed in October. The estimated co3t is 300,0001. or 400,0001. The Mexican treaty was still lingering in the Senate at Washington, ap- parently without a prospect of ratification. The latest accounts from Vera Cruz assert that Miramon had been compelledto abandon his attack upon that place, and also repeat the rumour that England and france were endeavouring to bring about an un- dentanding between the contending parties. Should an armistice be agreed upon, It will have the bene- fical eflect of liberating the heavy amnount belonging to the bondholders, which has been so long detained In the city of Mexico.
			Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in stoc;s and shares during the past month. The range of Consols, notwithstanding the turn in foreign poll- tics and the advance in the Bank rate of discount, isss been only 14- per cent. Compared with the quotaton at the commencement, the final price E2ows a reduction of Q per cent., or 1 per cent. reclkoning accrued dividend. In railway shares tshere wus a general riEe in the early part of the month, owing to favourable traffic returns, and, although a reaction has since occurred in sympathy with Consoks, the market is inherently firm:

			Anmexed is an abstract of the railway proceedings Of the week .-At a meeting of the Scottish Central the proposed dividend at the rate of 51 per cent. per Annum was agreed to. The arrangement with regard lo the general station at Perth was also approved; the terms, which are considered more favouraole than had been previously put forth, being 40 per cent. each to be paid by the Scottish North-Eastern and Scottish Central, and 20 per cent. by the Edin- bIrgh, Portb, and Dundee. The present dividend Is expected to be maintained. The Caledonian and S)ambartonsbire have ordered a distribution at the Tate of 4 per cent. per annum out of the available balance of 4,8731. The receipts for the past half- year showed an increase of T48. The first sod of the !Tenbury Railway has been cut. At the Vale of Neath meeting it was resolved to carry the surplus Tsvenue of 7,8791. to the suspense account, and it is Intended in every future half-year to devote 1,5001. to the same purpose. There has been au augmenta- lion in the receipts of the last six months under the ilead of passengers and coal, but a falling off in iron 4-ro and general merchandise. Tbe reduction in the latter case is attributed partly to the competition of the narrow gauge lines, and partly to the de- fective arrangements of the great communi- cating railways. Tho shareholders of the Man- c-hestcr, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire have ap- proved some Bills for short lines now before Parlia- mnent. The two important Acts authorizing work- Ing and traffic arrangements with the London and North-Western, Mlidland, and Great Northern Lave been thrown out by the House of Commons. At a meeting of the Scindo it was stated that the entire line is expected to be opened for traffic about fhe end of the present year. The cost of tho 114 mlaes of railway, including the additional worl-s necessary, will be under 1,400,0001. The trade of 3Kurrachee In 1859 amounted to 2,584,8001., showing an increase of 19% per cent. Wish respect to the Indus steam flotilla, six towing steamers and 25 cargo barges have arrived out, and successful trials have been made. The works on the Punjab line sre proceeding satisfactorily. It is intended to raise EOO.0000. additional capital for tho Scinde Railway.
			At tue qirand iTnux of C:anada meeting the recelpts for the half-year ending in December were announced to be 52,4901., or 31,8121. more than in the correaponding period of 1858. The local traffic has surpassed the original ex- pectation, but; the through traffic bas yet to be
			developed. The utm of 1~,600,0001. is intended to be raised to meet existing liabilities, and to pro- vide additional rolling stock, station accommoda- tion, &amp;c. The report of the Great Western of Canada recommends a dividend at the rate of 2 per cent. Psr annum ont of the available balance of 41,31A. The Colonial Government have consented not to caU upon tho company for the payment of interest for three years from the 1st of July, 1859, berore which time it is hoped that the arrangement made in 1857 for paying off the eutire debt will have been completed. The trafflo in the past half-year shows a falling off of 3,4801., and the expenses an increase of 4,5911., caus�ed principally by the working of tho Sarnia branch. At a meeting of the Cape Town it was stated that considerable progress bas been made in the earthworks on the line and in the shipments of materials. Four powerful locomotives have been sent out, and a moiety of the carriages and other rolling stock are now being despatched. The forfeiture of 7,980 shares was contirmed. At the Belgian Eastern Junction meeting it was announced that negotiations have been opened with the Government for the sale of the line. The receiptz and the tonnage of heavy merchandise in 1859 were stated to be slightly in excess of 1857, notwithstanding a dlminution in the coal traffic of 15,772 tons. The revenue in the past year was 14,474t., and the expenditure 13,9171., leaving a balance of 5571. The report of the Otto- man (Smyrna to Aldin) states that the delay in the progrews of the works is principally due to the non- payment of calls. Much still remains to be done before the firat section can be opened for traffic. The chairman, Sir Macdonald Stephenson, and the con- sulting engineer have visited the works, and report favourably respecting the future prospects of the un- dertaking. Everyassistance is atated to be rendered bythe Government. Authorityhasbeengiven to raise 250,0001. in debentures.

			The following on the Manchester markets during the past month is from Messrs. Barbour and Brother:-
			" There has been an occasional JU in this market during the past month, and in some cases rather lower prices have been current. No general reduction, however, took place, as spinners and manufacturers were too deeply under con- tract to be immediately influenced byany weakness in prices or temporary cessation of demand. A renewed activity has been experienced during the last 10 days, and a large busi- ness has again been done at the prices current in February, so that the principal producers are now as much en- gaged as formerly. A less sanguine feeling, however, pre- vails, as the quotations from India, China, and other markets, campared with the high rates current here, show In somo cases an actual loss to the merchant ; in addlton to tbis, the state of the political horizon and the increased value of money induce caution. Large operations are fre- quently entered into for India and Chlna, based on private teegrams, so that the delivery of the lettera by the regular mails has not much iufluence on the market. Communica- tion with Calcutta is now effected in a week.
			" The Llverpool cotten-market has been dull and buyers have an advantage of about id. per lb. in tie middling qualities compared wlth the rates current a month ago. Thc stock is now 848,000 bales, against; 325,000 a year ago and our imports in the present year have bee -,S,0 bales, against 618,000 at the same tUme l.ast var~." ,8,0

			II ~TAB OCCURRESCc.-About haif-patt 8 o'clock on Thursday evening a young woman named Ann Richards, aged 23, a parishioner of Westoury-on-Trym, was admitted as a pauper lunatic at the Clifton Union Work. house, by order of ono of the relieving offlcers. She had previously been in the service of Dr. Francis Fox, of Bar- lington, but having become derenged a day or two pre- viously she was removed to the union. On her admission nothing was observed in her manner to excite alarm and she was placed in one of the ordinary lunatic wards, two women being left to watch over her. Shortly after 9 o'clock the same night a noise was heard in the ward as of some one knocking violently, and the matron, Mrs. Hunt, a woman between 60 and 70 years of age, proceeded with an assistant to ascertain the cause. No sooner had they entered tho ward than the newly received inmate Richards, sprang at the assistant and commenced biting her arm. Mrs. Hunt went to the rescue of the assistant, when Richards turned round and struck her a violent back- handed blow on the region of the ear. A cry for additional assistance was immediately made, and the clerk to the union (H?r. R. Mercer) and other persons proceeded to the ward. Mfrs. Hunt was found on the floorin an insensible state, and was lifted up to be carried to her room; but before sbe reached the apartment she was dead. It should be stated that Mrs. Hunt has not latterly been in very good health, but has been complaining for the last few daya of being unwell. At a meeting of the board of guardias a resolution was passed condoling with the family of Mrs. Hunt, who bad en a faithful servant of the Union for many years, and whose husband, who was also aa officer of the Union, died exactly eight years age, on the same day of the month as the untoward event which deprived his widow of life. The young woman Richards, who has been the cause of this disastrous calamity, was on Friday in a perfectly calm state, end apparenly totally uconscious that she had been the means of depriving a fellow.creature of life.
			TrzB NEXT NAVAT, WAR.-It is not yet six years since we saw a war which commenced with proud fleets of line-of-battle ships end in one of ganboats, mortarboats, and floating batteries, sheathed with Iron. Tho former very nearly captured Sweaborg; the latter destroyed Kinbarn He wouid have been a bold man who would thea have asked for the publio moiney to build scre* three-deckerg, Time has, however, rendered us already forgetful of the experience then gained. Subeequent to that Russian war we have had two more wa6s at great distances from the mother country -for our existence in India, for our honour in Chia. Did the line-of.battle ship or the 50-guan frigate do an good service there ? No ; it was in onr soamen in India

Since then the rifled cannon and Armstrong shell have still further multiplied the objections to the big ship-the lefty target-the concentration of gus, and, above all, of human beings.

			LONDON, MONYDA , APBI 2, 1860,
			In the House of Commons, on Saturday, on the third reading of the Income-tax Bill,
			DIr. HENLEY protested against the introduction of a clause which had not been printed, and of which nobody knew anything; and
			DIr. GaniTEE complained of the thrnsting of clauses into Bills in this manner.
			The CILawcELaio of the ExcHEQoxa gave an ex- planation of the matter and the Bill passed.
			On the third reading of the Stamp Duties Bill,
			Sir H. CArNs suggested that the stamp duty imposed by the Bill on contracts for the sale of stock was not warranted by the resolution.
			The suggestion gave rise to considerable discus- sion, and caused some perplexity. The difficulty was at length got over, by recommitting the Bill and amending the schedule, dropping contract notes, which would be the subject of another Bill.
			The B'Il then passed.
			The CiscaELxor of the ExcnEQuER moved for leave to bring in a Bill to repeal the Act 7 GEoRaE II., cap. 8 (commonly caled "Sir Jon BRniAuD's Act"), and the Act 10 GEoRGE II., cap. 8.
			After some remarks by lIvr. WISE,
			YMr. JAm-Es asked whether the CHANcELToR of the EXCHEQUER'S object was to obtain a revenue from contract uotes for wagering transactions; if so, the 8th Vycronu. would prevent him.
			The CrAcsr,LOa of the ExcnEoquEn replied that Sir JoHN BAnNARi's Act had placed persons in the Stock-Exchange under a peculiar law, affecting not only wagering transactions, but the ordinary and regular business, and his object was to repeal this exceptional law, and to leave aUl wagering transac- tions subject to the general provisions of the act
			of VIcrOsuA.
			Leave was given to introduce the Bill, and the House adjourned at half-past 1 o'clock.

			Very eareless oir very stupid must that statesman be who can look without alarm on the present state and future prospects of the Gormanic Confedera- tion. The crisis at which Germany has arrived reminds us only too forcibly, as regards her foreign relations, of the state of things in the early part of that most gloomy year of her history, 1806. At that period, as now, France was strong, warlike, and aggressive, led on by a chief of surpassing ability, and entirely emancipated from those traditions which fettered, if they could not always restrain, the ancient monarchies of Europo. Austria then, as now, was staggering and almost stupified under the effects of a mighty blow, for Austerlitz has found no unworthy counterpart in Solferino. Italy was then overshadowed by French influence, and the smaller Powers of Germany, buried each pro- foundly in its own individual selfishness and shortsightedness, were considering, alike unmindful of the general interest, what could be snatched from the common ruin to increase their splendour or their influence. Prussia alone stood erect, confid- ing in the army and in the reputation of her great Kn-G-Prussia, which had stood aloof during the dreadful struggle between France and Austria, which had congratulated NAJraoLzoa on the mor- row of Austerlitz, and which hoped, while securing the immunities of peace, to obtain lor herself all the advantages which could be gained by suC- cessful war. A little time served to dispel these delusions. Austria suedhumbly for peace, and obtained it. Tha smaler States of Germany were formed into new combinations or aggregated into kingdoms under names unheard of in history, and Prussia on the fields of Jena and Auerstadt fell prostrate before the impetuous valour of the legions of France. Such was the state of Germany 54 years ago. In those days the people went for little or nothing, but the Confederation fell because the Sovereigns were utterly unable to trust each other. Each was anxious for a general scramble, in order to gain, if possible, a little more territory, and each only awoke to find his dream of indi- vidual aggrandizement lost in the reality of uni- versal slavery.
			If any one wishes to see what are the passions and feelings which actuate modern Germany, let him tum back to that announcement in our columns which tells him the decision of the Bund on the future Constitution of the Electo- rate of Hesse Cassel. The Bund resolves, Prussia dissenting, to reject the Constitution of 1831, and to affirm the Constitution of 1S52, the odious work of HASSENPFLUG, or zEssEs- saucu, " the Carse of " Hesse," as the people delighted to call him. At the present moment such a decision is peculiarly significant. The deepest discontent prevails throughout Ger- many. The people have lost confidence in their individual Sovereigns, and still more have they lost confidence in the combination of them by which Germany is governed. A powerful and warlike nation is concentrated in arms on their frontier, and now, if ever, it is necessary to rouse once more to the aid of German nationality that national enthusiasm which her Princes knew so well how to call forth and how to deceive in 1813. The days are gone by when nations can be saved by a league of Sovereigns. Kings must take their people with them if they expect that their deliberations will amount to any- thing more than impotent manifestations. It is not by riveting fetters on one of the members of the Confederation that the German Bund proves its aptitude for dealing with the emergencies of the pre- sent time. Beaten, disheartened, disjointed, politi- cally, morally, and materially bankrupt, Austria- the living death of what was once a florishing Empire-is still the life and soul of the great Germanic Confederation. Her spirit animates the whole mass, her blood circulates through every vein, her voice rules their councils, her intel- lect presides over their deliberations. The same inert regard for tradition, the same helpless inability to adopt new ideas, wvhich rendered the defeat in Italy evenmore disgracefulthan calamitous, give the tone to and dictate the measures of the Germanic Confederation. Austria forms the nucleus round which the petty States of Germany love to cluster; Austria forms the head which theirwise and magnanimous Sovereigns love to follow. Prussia, in- deed, as in 1806, stands still erect, an exception to the rest of the Germanic Confederation. For Prussia has stiU a prosperous exchequer,and still a surplus revenue, and a Government which, if not exactly liberal, has liberal tendencies. But Prussia is more than counterbalanced in tho deliberations of the Bund by Austria, and, isolated as she is from the rest of Germany, shie may perhap3 find that she has little choice between re- peating the campaign of 1806, with a strong
			probability of the same calamitous resut, or listening to tho propositions which there is too much reason to suppose that France is ready 'to make her, with the view of obtaining by the pen that which she is otherwise tempted to conquer by the sword. What if France be disposed to offer to Prussia, in exchange for her Rthenish Provinces, Saxony, Hanover, Brunswickc, and Mecldenburg, -territories which could offer little or no re- sistance to such an amalgamation? M ight not Prussia think it better to surrender for an equiva- lent so fully adequate that which she will hardly retain after the most desperate and costly efforts ? The TaxD NAroeoi, has found a Detter means of executing his will than the snr. He views long campaigns and bloody battles as the re- sources of bunglers in the art of kingcraft He has his choice among the Sovereigns of Europe, all competing with each other for the honour of being his instrument in the development of any policy he may choose to adopt, or the appropria- tion of any territory he may choose to seize.
			Tf we turn to the people of Germany, we find that their Sovereigns have little or no reason to count on their loyalty. The people have not forgotten the promises which were made and broken to their fatners in 1813, and made and broken to themselves in 1848, and they do but await a fitting opportunity to rid themselves of an odious domi- nation. The Tyrolese and the Croats are wearied of their allegiance to a Power which can neither appreciate their services nor reward their devotion; while Hungary, Bohemia, the Southern Tyrol, and Venetia threaten Austria with all the horrors which the rebellion of a justly-provoked people can bring with it. Let Germany, then, look to herself; em- pires and provinces are won in these days by other means than by those of brute force. We have seen what can be effected by universal suffrage, by municipal demonstrations, or even, when these means fail, by nameless, unappointed, and unre- cognized deputations. Prussia may be offered a tempting equivalent, and the Rhine, after all,-is it not a national boundary? Seewhat sacrifices Piedmont has made in surrendering Savoy, and ask whether every considerable Ger- man Sovereign may not receive an equivalent as ample as that against which she has been content to truck the loyalty and devotion of 800 years. It never yet was known that one success blunted the appetite of the gamester for another, and when we see -what has been done we may partly conclude what it is we are next to expect. Under these circumstances, we should be glad to hear wvhat are the intentions of Germany. Is she determined to w ait till the last moment? Is she to go on confiscating the liberties and trampling on the rights of mankind till the very stones of her cities rise up to protest against her cruel and callous injustice ? Now, if ever, Germany needs that her Princes should be united among themselves, and her people should bo confirmed in their loyalty. Unhappy is that nation to which danger cannot teach union, and infatuated are those Princes to -whom a bitter experience, just about to repeat itself, cannot teach the most ordinary precepts of equity and moderation.

			From time to time those quiet, gentlemanlike conversations, which are held in the House of Lords touch China in their range of topics. On Friday night Lord GBY, not unseasonably, turned the current of their Lordships' speculations in this direction. The First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs under Lord DERBY's Government, the Plenipotentiary Elect to China, and a late Governor-General of India, who had himself in past years directed operations against China, all applied themselves to keep the baR flying, and to give liveliness and vividness to the discussion. We distant Lsteners, who are admitted to all these gentle, uneventful conversations, by the agency of an almost unseen machinery, might expect to learn from the words of such eminent men all that we could wish to know. Surely such men as these must all have sharp and well-defined ideas as to the causes that have produced past events, and which must act upon the future ? Such men would draw from their large philosophy a well poised comparison between the stagnant civiization of the East and the energetic movement of the West, and would tol us how the ordinary prin- ciples of action which guide European nations in their conduct towards each other - must be modified when we attempt to arrive at just ends in our intercourse with a great semi-barbaric Power. These expectations are not, however, altogether fulfiled when we read what these iLlustrious statesmen said. Lord GBEY was curious only as to the expense of the military and naval operations; Lord MAsaunity was scandalized only that we had not applied our western principles of international law with a sufficiently pedantic minuteness when dealing with an empire to which these principles are unknown. Lord Ear.annoiouaH was shocked that either we or our ally should think of " chastising" an act so unimportant as the destruction of some hun- dreds of our soldiers and sailors. Lord Ewnu was explanatory of what was past, but by no meaus communicativeasto the coursoof actionwhich
			he proposed to himself in his new embassy. There was not in the conversation of any of these noble- men, except only in that of Lord Ewin, the evi- dences of reading and inquiry upon the matter in debate vhich we might look for in personages of such prominent position seeking to direct a national policy. When Lord EaLEBonouei tells us that " the advance of a hostile nrmy "on Pekin, 'with tne prospect of its being cap- "tured, would be sufficient to cause every
			woman and every child within its walls to be "sacrificed by their relatives," we think of the very recent capture of Canton, and we wonder that an eminent nobleman should tell us such an old wife's tale. When Lord GREy tells us, upon the authority of a random remark by that poor old GUTZLArF, who was ridiculous even in his own day, that the Chinese indemnity had produced the Chinese rebellion, we wonder that so earnest a speaker should never have looked into those standard histories compiled from received Chinese authorities which relate a constant succession of Chinese rebellions, rising to dates beyond the vista of our most ancient histories. Lord GBy might with equal justice have said that the military cha- racter of the French nation had its origin in the Battle of Waterloo.
			But amid the " points" which were made in this House of Lords' discussion there is one of such great practical importance that it ought not to be allowed to pass without some further ventila- tion. Lord Al4XESBUxy was most pertinacious in his reiterated demand that before any warlike ope- rations were undertaken against the forces of the Emperor of C.mA war should be declared. "Why," he asks, " were not the principles of inter- "national law observed, and a declaration of war "made in due form ?" Again, in the same speech ho says:-"As the Chinese were treated as a European " State in Eending out an Ambassador, so he would "employ the same forms and ceremonies with re- "spect to war and peace." Once more reverting to this snbject, he complains that " it was an "anomaly that a civilized nation should conduct "hostilities without a declaration of war." Now, this is counsel from a high authority to commit a very disastrous blunder. What we call a declaration of war, whether in the shape of a proclamation by heralds, or an advertisement in the Zondon Gazette, or an Order in Council, is a thing as
			unknowvn in China as a Christmas dinner of plum-pndding aud roast beef. The Chinese would never hear of the pageant at the Royal Exchange, and would never read the advertisement. If they were informed of both they would not mnder- stand them, and it would be impossible to explain them. The thing is outside the orbit of their ideas. As they would not understand what a declaration of -war means, it follows that the fact could not influence their conduct. It woula imDose no new obligations upon them; but it would impose very great obligations upon us. 'We should have, by force of our own Western laws, to withdraw our Consuls, and to stop our trade along the whole seaboard of China. We should be com- pelled to place British subjects under the pro- tection of United States' Consuls, and to carry on what trade we could carry on by the inter- vention of American merchants. It would be our duty, if we adhered strictly to the laws which we are urged to obey, to proclaim all intercourse with China to be hightreason in British subjects; and it would be highly irregular to allow the importation of tea or to permit the export of opium. Even among ourselves, these ancient rules of international hostility are become rusty and unused. They are found to come back like tho boomerang, and do most damage to those who use them. To apply them to China would cost us ten millions of revenue and -would ruin all our mer- chants. It would also, no doubt, punish the Chinese teagrowers, and disappoint the opium- smokers. But, as Lord ELoGN very sensibly ob- served, "pressure on individuals never yet brought " a war to a close," and, if there be any country in the world where pressure on individuals would have less weight than in all others, that country is China. The authorities at Pekin hear with mar- vellous unconcern not only of the takdng of Canton or of the destruction of a flotilla, but even of the sack of vast cities, where, after the carnage is done, the rebel leader calmly reports that " we slew them "u utterly, even to the children at the breast." These locusts have now for eight years preyed upon the fairest valleys of China, yet no real efforts have been made to quell them, except when they ap- proached Pekin. Then the Imperial strength was put forth in earnest, and proved sufficient to destroy two of these swarms cf homicides. As to a decla- ration of war, we might as well translate the Ame- rican Declaration of Independence into Chinese and send it to the Pekin Mandarins. As to with- draving our Consuls and interdicting trade, we right as well practise the salutes of the fencing-school in front of a savage who is fitting an arrow to-his bow. It is impossible to paint in its full strength the contempt which a Chinese statesman would feel for a Western barbarian who should decline to trade at Amoy because he was determined to-fight at Taku; and we are by no means certain that whatever language he might usee would deserve translation.
			Lord ELGm goes forth with many difficulties before him, but perhaps he leaves his greatest difficulties behind him. Nobody knows better what it is necessary that he should do, but no one is more thoroughly aware what a squadron of heavy hobbyhorse-riders wil bear down npon him if he should dare to do it. The country wiiU endorse Lord E80NBOITOUGE'S compliment to the " fortunate audacity" of the Earl, but we are not sure that we have observed in him the same ad- venturous spirit in deaEng with Engliih as with Chinese Mandarins. These facts, however, cannot have escaped his penetration. If he should iail in the least degree, he will have every hobbyhorse- man in the Lords, the Commons, and Exeter- haU down upon him at full gallop. If he should succeed, ho will stm have them prancing and k;icking around him, but they will not be able to do him harm; but if he should fail by trying to conciliate these gentlemen, and by trying to weld their crotchets into his own policy, he must not expect to find in them either the 'wiU or the power to defend him from the opprobrium which the country always fixes npon weakness. Lord ELaow is not the Mlinister of the merchants now trading with China, nor of their enemies in the House of Peers, nor of the platform spouters. It is very weeU for irre- sponsible gentlemen to indulge in pretty senti- mentalities, and for special classes to try to retain special advantages, but the nation sends out Lord EaoNr to do the nation's work,-to open np China to our general commerce,-to obtain such wise and firm stipulations that when the Muscovite comes to take the place of the Mongol our interests may still be semre,-and, lastly, to complete his work so thoroughly that we may have no more China wars.

			The history of the Income-tax is truly a strange one. We may defy the most experienced of politi- cians to produce anything like it, or to show us another example of an impost condemned and adopted by every financier in turm; denounced by every party and yet introduced into every Budget; unpopular in the country beyond all other taxes, and yet accepted with greater readiness than any; always proposed as a. temporary expedient, and yet always retained as a permanent obligation; stigmatized as immoral, but admirea as pro- ductive; fraught with inequalities, but not ad- mitting of rectification; and combining, in short, aU the most opposite characteristics and all the most unaccountable tendencies. On Friday evening its anomalies came out in strong relief. Every- body's hand was against it. Air. GL&amp;usroNz and MIr. DisnrAnELam fought over it rather sharply; but, except for the purposes of political strife, neither the one leader nor the other could make much out of the argument. Mr. DiSmAzL claimed to have handled the tax with a view to the rectification of its inequalities
			but then he must have given it a per- manency of character admitting of no defence. Mr. GLADsroNE had been all against permanency, and had proscribed the tax in toto, but unhappily, instead of dying away, it had taken new root, and was throwing out its branches w,ith unparalleled luxuriance. To complete the climax, the Lords are this day to suspend their Standing Orders, in order that the Bill may, in its present aggravated form, be passed throrgh all its stages in one sitting, and become binding without delay.
			The dilemma expressed in the last discussion im the Commons is precisely that which has dis- tinguished the whole subject from first to last. There is no man who is not ready with his gibe or his denunciation for this unlucky tax. It is iniquitous, it is demoralizing, it is unjust, and, what is worst of all, neither its injastice nor its iniquity admits, we are assured, of any mitigation. The natural conclusion therefore is, that so undesirable an impost should be erased from the statute-book, like other im- posts irreconcilable with the public sense of right and justice. This, indeed, is the resolu- tion to -which all Chancellors of the Exchequer, except M1r. DisBAr, have come, or professed to come. Sir ROExar PEEF began, as MIr. ROABUCK reminded the House, by acknowledging that the objections against the tax -were unanswerable, but that he wanted the money, and accord- ingly he exacted the contribution, but limited ths duration of the burden. As it happened, how- ever, the end never came, and the unjustifiabla tax continued to thrive and fructify until, eight years later, people became uneasy at the prolonga- tion of so exceptional an arrangement, and asked for an inquiry. The inquiry was granted, and tha result seemed to be that the tax must be retained,,
			bat that its bearinga should be modified. So, at least, thought MIr. DIsBAr, who, on coming to office in 1852, proposed a reduced ate of assessment for the schedule under which IErEcarious incomes were rated. In this attempt
			was defeated by his antagonist. Mr. GLAn- STosm could not justify the inequality which MIr. DsArr desired to redress. He had been as eloquent on that point as anybody, but to amend the tax was tr9 retain it-almost to justify it, 7hereas it was a moral enormity, not to be tole- rated for an instant beyond the crisis which had isaUed it into being. Patchwork and white- wrash were out of the question. The whole -tructure must come down, and its very traces be obliterated, the year 1860 being its date of doom. The country applauded the uncompromising on- 4laught, and if 1860 had brought the extinction of the Income-tax Mr. GL Asro.NE's policy would, no doubt, have been triumphant. As it is, there is an error In the reckoning wnich gives Mr. DisBLI a considerable advantage over his rival. The Income-tax has not been extinguished, on the con- trary, it is flourishing with more than usual vigour, -nd the public, therefore, might as well have had the little improvement which he was ready to offer along with the permanence, which Mr. GaaDsroxB could not prevent.
			The truth of the matter is, that there is a neces- aity in the case overruling argument on both sides. What the late Sir RoBxaT PxnL said was as much as could be said by anybody. The tax was an unjust tax, but the money must be had, and there were no better means of procuring it. TIr. G7AD- sron: wanted his 10,000,0001., and he could not get them otherwise. After all, too, the form of the thing has been kept up. The tax is proposed 0' for one year only," and the exigency, if not an actual exigency of war, Is as near like one as could occu In a time of peace. The money has been 4pent upon armaments, upon new three-deckers, 'ew frigates, Au3sTRoNc guns, and Enfield rifles. The Volunteers are out again, as in 1805, and our 'ockyards have echoed from morning to night with the hammer of the artisan. That we have not been actually at war is so much gain ;-we have gained confidence and security. We could not have got more by a victorious campaign, and the money which has produced these fruits cannot have been Mll spent. Altogether, the case for the levy of the Income-tax is pretty well as good as ever it was. where was a real crisis-European war, convul- aiona of States, and no adequate strength in the Wavy of England.
			Although, however, we admit this much, we must needs say that, if the Income-tax is still to go on, always terminable, and yet never terminated- above all, if It is to be capriciously augmented for every purpose of finance, and made to do the work of every impost in its turn-we do not beheve jn inquiry can be escaped. Either the tax will 3bve to be reconstructed, or the public must leamn more clearly than they have learnt yet the reasons why reconstruction is impossible. MIr. GLADSTONE'S argumenta on this point were anything but satis- factory. It is rather late in the day to observe that other taxes are often unjust also, and useless to remark that absolute fairness is out of the question. Of courze, such a tax, however levied, would involve many inequalities of incidence; but that is no reason for leaving without redress the glaring inequalities which exist at present. The argument of MIr. GLADsTonE and his followers is that, since it is im- possble to satisfy everybody, it is better to satisfy none; but to this we entirely demur. On the same grounds, in fact, every species of exemption x[ight be condemned, for there will always remain Some whose title to relief, though unimpeachable iu itself, has been overlooked or rejected.

			Mr. Commissioner Gos=usN gave judgment on Friday last in another of those sad cases in vhich a fraudulent solicitor plays the leading part. This time the culprit was a certain GEORGE DIoNTAU EVANs, who had for a considerable time carrlied on his business in the town of Farn- ham. He had succeeded to the practice of his uncle, Mr. SsorTm-a gentleman who seems to 3iave acted with thorough honour and respect- ability throughout the -whole of his pro- fessional career. When the nephew came to the direction of the business there was
			' change of system. The young man was not content with the small but sufficient income arising from the profits of his business, but was in haste 'to be rich. Now, if men wish to be lich suddenly, they must speculate and run risks. As long as they speculate only with their own money, and risk only sums which they can afford to pay if the chances of the table run against them, no person has a right to call them to account. WYhen the dog in the fable let the lump of meat fall Into the water for a clutch at the sha- dow, if he had honestly come by the meat, it was his own affair. He chose to run the risk of losing a moderate meal upon the chance of getting a better one, and went without dinner altogether. 'The real wickedness begins when a man enters upon a speculation who is unable to pay if it turns out ill; or, still worse, when it is a man who uses the property of others as his counters to play out the desperate game. Wre havo had of late more than one caso in which a solicitor has used the property of his clients intrusted to his charge, either as professional adviser er trustee, as the fund upon which to draw when he wished to carry on his speculations. One of the most unfortunate features in these cases is, that a fraudulent solicitor does not drag down one, two, or three, but a whole train of clients along with him in his ruin. When he gIa once entered upon his criminal career he cannot stop. To make good his defalcations at one point he must commence a fresh system -of plunder at another. His conscience, which was at first dulled, is at length altogether paralyzed. He becomes an adept in the science of tricking a client out of a signature here, and of embezzling a portion of a trust fund there. The hope of ever refunding the money which he has stolen at length abandons him, but not a bit the less for that must be persevere in his criminal course. He must adjourn discovery until the latest possible moment, and that he may do this he must rob everybody who has trusted him of every shilling on which he -can possibly lay his hand.
			The two or three later cases have been those ~of London attorneys who have played the scoundrel upon a grander and a more magnificent scale. GEOGo Mo3NTAGrrE EvANs is a specimen of the provincial viUain. The actual money amount 4oE his defalcations is less than in one of the Lon0on cases, but we must not conclude that he was the cause of a lesser amoint of human misery. He mado up in the number of his victims for their want of positive wealth. As far as they were concerned, indeed, it mattered but little. He took from them their all, whatever it was, and that, all represented the earnings of a hard and laborious life. Ono of the victims was a poor fellow named Boxina, who had scraped together by infinite pains and toil the sum of 1901. This wa asll he had in the world; but " Lawyer " Ev^.&amp;m" cheated him out of the whole of his liffle savings. Although he did not disdain the smallest gnat-, this Farnham spider had a stomach for the largest fly that ho could allure into his veb. It appears that thero was a certain Mr. P7Am, who had retired from business, in which he lacd realized a considerable fortune. This gentle- man had placed his professional confidence in Mr. ;Sg0ion $, the honest uncle: that confidence, unfor.
			tunately for himzelf and those who were to come after Em, he tranafed to MoNn6m EvANs, the rascally nephew. Mr. P.&amp;YHE became cotrustee with EvAis for tho sum of 20,0001. M3r. PAv.ra fell ill, and at length was lying upon 'his deathbed. This was the moment chosen by EvrAs for paying him a profea0ional vi9iti at-
			tended by two clerk, xWith - gibat difficulty he i obtained, buit at fength he did obtain, an interview with the dying man. Ms PAiNE, fearing that an attempt was about to be made to obtain her hus- band's signature at a time when he was unable to deal with matters of business, for some time re- fused to leave the room, but at length her absence was enforced. It was at this time, as she believes and as she told the Court. that her dying hus- band's signatare was obtained to a power of attor- ney, which gave EvA?s, the cotrustee, power to deal with the whole fund. It is almost needless to say that he appropriated the money to his own use, and Mrs. PAfSN, the widow, has since been compelled to make good the defalcation from her husband's estate, as well as to defend eight or nine Chancery suits arising from the misapplication of the trust. Another case was that of a certain Mrs. MAaRRIor, EvsNS was trustee for her under her marriage settle- ment, and in that capacity got from her the sum of 3501. He gave her a passbook, in which there was a sham account of advances made to a Mr. TntmiAn. Something at last occurred which aroused Mfrs. AaEsRoRi's suspicions, and when she pressed EvAxs more closely on the subject of these advances he said, "I am MIr. Tnm.AN; don't "tell of me." Another instance of a similar fraud was perpetrated on MIr. STzES? Prusm. In another case EvANs had torn a seal off a bond in order to invalidate it, and there were other instances of a like kind. The Commissioner in passing judgment might well remark that a more cruel and heartless case, one more thoroughly replete with wickedness and fraud, had never come before the Connrt
			The end of it all has been a refusal of the bank- rupt's certificate. This Is al that a Judge in Bank- ruptcy could do, and Mr. Commissioner GoutLBUN has done it; but we trust that such a criminal as EvANs has proved himself to be may be brought before another Court, wherm he may receive a more adequate punishment. Every conceivable aggravation which can accom- pany and surround a career of crime Is found in cases such as this. The offenders have be- trayed in the most deliberate manner a solemn trust; they have violated professional confidence; they have treacherously taken advantage of the ignorance of their clients; they have ruined, not one, but scores of familes, casting some out on a Iffe of renewed toil, and throwing others upon the world who are without the technical skill and the confirmed habits of labour necessary to earn even a bare subsistence in snch a country as this. All this they have done, without any of those strong temptations which may palliate, if theY cannot excuse, acts of violent crime. Their wickedness is perpetrated with every circumstance of deliberation and craft. It requires a very high degree of skill and a good professional educa- tion to make a villain of this class. Hle sits night after night planning and contriving his villanies, and it requires weeks, sometimes months, to bring them to maturity. Can a single word be urged in their defencei These fraudu- lent solicitors are, in point of fact, the worst culprits who can be placed at the bar of a criminal tribunal, and, when convleted there, there is no punishment too severe for the injury they have inflicted on their fellow-creatures. The peril, too, is a common one; we are all more or less in the hands of solicitors. There are subtle kinds of fraud by which those among us who are most hackneyed in the ways of business may be caught, as well as grosser forms of deception, prepared for the destruction of such unfortunate persons as the peasant victims in this case of EvANs. It is a lamentable fact, such are the complicated forms of English law, that few people, except strictly profes- sional men, can understand the meaning of their own marriage settlements-of their own wills-of the title deeas under which they hold their property -of the mortgage deeds which help them to raise money upon it-still less of the equitable doctrines affecting trust transactions. Upon all such matters we are entirely in the hands of solicitors, and if they betray us we are betrayed indeed.

			LATEST ENWINCE
			AUSTRIA AND ITALY.
			I [I!1~o b I lSDU=o ~Btheda 1Iowing app~e&amp;ed In our~ secondl cal- Al.z Oil satu&amp;y.)
			The fo1owing teIeia'- have been received at Mr. IReutees office:-
			VIENNA, MhucR 3L
			" The Austrist Cabinet hs resolved to protest solemnly against the annexation of Tuscany, Parmas, and Modena to Piedmont. A note to this offect, dated the 24th inst., has been directly addressed to the Cabinet of Turin.
			"' In this note Austria first establishes, by histo- ricn and legal considerations developed at great length, her positive and incontestable right to oppose an act which, in despoiling legitimate Princes of the States guaranteed to them by European trea- ties, would also destroy the rights of succession and reversion which these same treaties secure to the H0ouse of Hapsburg with respect to the said States.
			" Austa then proceeds to demonstrate that Sardinia has participated in the engagements con- tracted by France, who, in consideration of the treaty of 1735, has guaranteed the possession of Tuscany to the House of Lorraine, In order to in- demnify this dynasty for the cession of her ancestral heritage.
			"The note ot Austria furher recalls that, by virtue of the treaty concluded in 1753 by the medi- ation of George IL King of England, and counter- signed by him in his quality of head of the House of Este, the right of succession in the Modenese States was conferred, in case of the extinction of the male line, upon the third son of the Emperor Francis and Maria Theresa, whom it was designed to unite to the granddaughter of the Duke of Modena.
			" With respect to the Duchy of Parna and Fla- cenza, the treaty of the 10th of June, 1817, con- clhded between Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, and Sardinia, explicitly confirms In favour of Austria the rights of reversion stipulated by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, dated the 20th of May, 1815. These rights of reversion have re- ceived a fresh sanction by the treaty of Florence, concluded on the 28th of November, 1844 between the Courts of Lucca, Modena, Tuscany, Sardinia, and Austria.
			" Thus, then, the King of Sardinia, In accepting the annexation of the Italian Duchies, openly vio- lates not-only the public treaties of 1815, but also the treaties which he has signed as a direct contract- ing party with Austria.
			" Such a violation is so much the more flagrant from having been accomplished upon the morrow after the Peace of Villafranca and Zurich, of which the essential condition was the restoration of the legitimate Princes.
			" Induced by all these motives, Austria protests in the most peremptory manner against this most illegal annexation made by the King of Sardinia, and appeals to the conscience of aU Europe on the subject.
			" To this end, at the same time that thin protest is forwarded to Turin, a copy will be rurnisbed to all the foreign Cabinets, to whom also a circular note is addressed by Austria, in which it is said, 'that Austria, in confining herself at the present time to protesting against the said annexation, hopes that Europewill recognize in this proceeding a most convincing proof of her moderation and of her desire to maintain the peace of the world.'

			"Count Rechberg has communicated to M. Steiger, Charg6 d'Affaires of Switzerland, tho de- finitive reply of Austria to the protest against the annexation of Savoy addressed by the Federal Council to the great Powers.
			"In reference to the annexation of Savoy, Aus- tria declarea that, after having ascertained the views of the other great Powers, she could not abandon the passive and reserved attitude which her real interests demand in that affair.
			" As regards the neutrality of Switzerland and the neutralized districts of Chablais and Faucigny, Austria declares her readiness to join her good offices to those of the other great Powers for the ful- filment of the legitimate wishes of Switzerland, the more because the circular note of M. Thouvenel of the 13th nlt. promised beforehand to respect the guarantees granted to Switzerland by the treaties of 1815."-

			PlU UNYERBSITY BOAT &amp;IQE.
			This great race-the De1by if the Thsmes-the most er- citing wnttest of Its kind that can be witnesad in 4uy part of the world, came off on Saturday with all Its cLustomay 6dat. Owing to the inconvenient stte of the tide, it was at first intended that the race should be rowed down the river from Mortlake to Putney; but for varions reons thi2 arrangement was at last abandoned, and the usual counse up the stream ws adhered to, the time of starting being altered from 1 in the day to half.past 8 in the morning. Doubtless, among the other inducements to choose this earl
			hour, was the hope that by so doing the number of steam- boats which always follow close in the wake of the competi- tors might be in some measume reduced. If this wda so, however, the precaution proved of no avail, for tho steamers were almost more numeronus and more crowded than on previons occasions, and the only change which tho early hour appeared to have effected was in diminishing the attendance of thoso visitora who generally line the bank, of the river in such numbers and add such gaiety and animation to the scene. Eventually some strlngent measures will have to be adopted. with regard to the steamboats on these occaslons or this gret race will either be completely spoilt or one of its Anniver- saries marked by sumh an accident As may throw a gloom over futur contests for years to come.
			During the week previous to the race both crews had been actively at work over their intended courSe, and each had tested its strength to the utmost with an elght-oare4 crew of pls-edwatermen. From thee prelirminarytriall ws judged that Cambridge had a slght, though decided, advantage over their antagonists of the sister univer. sity. Thelr rowing were decidedly quicker and gene- rally beleved to be scarcely less strong than that of Oxford. The latter, however, in their trials of speed, seemed- it was said, to be rather husbanding their resources. and they occasionally put on a " spurt," when they chose, which took them over the water at a tremendous pace. Thls led to the betting being almost even tilthe morng of starting, when, on the whole, Oxford was rather the favoLrite; though the opinion of professional watermen leant stiU as much as ever in favour of light blue. In point of weather, the morning was aU that could be 'wished; there being just stficlent indication of heavy
			rain to keep the matter, for a time, in suspense-
			and make everybody grateful in the extreme that it did not come down after alL Ihe awnd had been strong durlng tho night, but gradnally Inulled, and by the time the steamers reached Putney the water was as smooth as a mill-pond, and, on the whole, ono of the beswt days for a rowing match which has happened for many yeas. The supporters of both Universities assembled at Patneyit large numbers, and in splte of the early hour, about which, as rather talking from tho ddcat of the race, saome forcible opinions were expressed, the steamers were completely crowded, and the smart cutters of the Westminster bayT and London Bowing Club were out as usual, and skdxomo&amp; like swallows over the water.
			Contrary to usual custom, according to whlch it seems ne- cessary that the start should be at lesat from half an hour to three quarters behind its proper timo, both crews got ready for the race with the most laudable punotnality-Ox. ford from the White Hart and Cambridge from the Star and Garter. Oxford rowed in the same boat (built by MAtS Taylor, of Newcastle) in which they won the match ls year, when the Cantabs were swamped by the rough water. though not until they had completely lost all chanoo of winning. Profiting by the lemon, however, Camibrldge thih year had a rather stouter though a light and beautiful boat, buit by Searle, which certainly seemed all, and in the event proved to be all, that could be wlshed for the occa- slon. Tho weights and crews of eaohboatworeas foUows:-
			Mr. J. W. Chitty, late Fellow of Exeter Colege, Oiford, acted as umpire, in one of the Cltizen hoats, and Mir. Searler officiated as starter. Oxford, as last year, won the toss for shore, and, of course, took the Middlesex side. Precisely at half-past 8 o'clock the word was given, both boats dippedi their oars simultaneously, and seemed to sprlng forward with a hound, and then e3ch crew went at it tn good earnest, Oxford gradually pushing her boat's nose mora and more in advance tiU opposite the Putney Cricest- ground, when she was half a length ahead. The Cantabs now seemed to warm to thelr task, and made their bost fly forward with each stroke. Animated by tremendous cheer- ing, they slowly but sorely gained on their opponents til
			the distance between them wasreduced,when inturn " light blue" began to forge ahead, and got a slight lead, whlchwas afterwards maintained with more or less snocees throughout the race. Yet, Up to within a ahort distance of the goal it seemed almost an open questlonwhich wouldwln, for Oxford fought every step, and compelled her opponents to use the most tremendous efforts to keep the lea1 they hacl so hardly gained. Under Hanmersmlth-brldgo Cambridge had a clear lead of more than a boat's length, and seamed' about to increase the distance, hut the water here became rather rougher, and the " way5" was perceptibly less rapid; Here the Oxonians put on a desperate spurt, and made such progresm in reducing their adversarles' lead that it seemed even then that the fortune of the race was about to alter, The chers and counter-cheers, the shouts of "Poll, Ox- ford; pull!" and cries of " Cambridge wins !" seemed to excite each crew to the very utmost, and on the tack warom the stream from Surrey to Middlesex Oxford rowed despe- rately and almost overtoak their gallant adversaries, This, however, was a final effort, and from the Barnes railway-bridge it wms seen that, acdaents emcluded, the race Vws virtually over. Stl the paco was kept up with the losers till CAmbrildg had passed the winning post, when they threw up thelr oars in token of an honomuable defeat-a defeat which they had striven to avert by all that skill and perseverance andl strength could accompUsh. The winners-who at once rowed back to Patney-were loudly cheered. They ertainly won this race in the most gallamt style; and, though their efforts during the contest had been tremendous, neither crew seemed in the least distressed. Therobeing no tide the race was not a very rapid one, the time occupled being 25 minutes. At the last trial Cambridge, It is said, rowed the entire course, of four miles and a-quarter, in less than 22 minutes.
			In the evening both crews dined together at the Alhlbon.

			TO TH EDITO-R OF THE TZ3TES.
			Sir,-It is with a painful feeling of astonishment I read in Sir Robert Pel'Es speech that "the policy of aggrandize- ment andterritorialaggression" pursued byLouls Bonaparte " is the revolutionay policy which was adopted in 1848 by AL da Iamartine and M. Louis Blanc."
			I beg to nay tbat such a statement is directly at vr-iance with facts known to aU Europe.
			0 The sp7iit wich pervpades tho Afanifeste caUPuissaneeC, published In 1848 as declaratory of the foreign policy of the new Fxench Republic, is fairly and striLingly illustrated by the folowing passages :-" War Is not the prlnclplo of the French Republic." "To revert to the prindple of conquest acted upon by the Empire would be, not to advance, but to retrograde." " The goal towards whlch our zteps aro di- rected is brotherhood and peace."
			To such an extreme degree was the Manifcstc aux Puissanccs, as penned by AL do Lamartine, opposed to anything like a policy of " territorial aggression," that th most onward portion of the Republican party received wii&amp; disfavour thls solemn document, precisely becauso they thouaght that the exaggerated moderatlon of Itv tone wa liable to be misconstrued into a wan of determination ana energy-an opianion in which the minority of the Providosil Government, and I, as one of them, concurred.
			However, as far as the Maniffstc auz Pui&amp;saneca depre- cated all Idea of selfish encroachment and military conques4 it was in perfect keeping wlth the principles professedl by the party which the Provisional Government had to represent.
			For as much as the French Repub'lcans are inclineodf
			assist such natlonalities as aremimltakably trampled upo71 by foreign oppressors, so mush are they averse to any r intended for the self-seeking purposes of nmbition, military glory, and territorial conquest.
			I mnow but too well the prejudices sedulously spread and fostered In this country respecting the supposed aggressive- ness of thhe Republican party ; bat, at any rate, Sir Robert Peeli s'iot justified In adducing, In support ofthesepre- judices, anything that I have ever done, maid, or signEcd, sa a member of the Provisonal Government,
			The fact is (and this I have said over and over again), ths party to whic'h I belong consider war, even when nnavoid- able, as one of the saddest proofs of the unsound condition of the world ; they are for no other conqests than those which mark peacefully the progress of the human humama mind; they deny kings, and governments of any descrip- tion, the right of disposing of nations as mere catlUe ; they take standing armies to be Inconsistent with liberty, and they feel acutely enough how easily a victorious warrior Is changed into a world-admired despot I
			May I ask of you, in the interest of historicsl truth, tha inssrtton In yrur paper of theseZrearks ?

			.THE JUDICIAL CoM3riTTz Op THE PRIVY
			COUNCIL, Mfarch 29.
			F2ASXM V. BUREGS.
			(rZ'nun.-Lord EG Savowx, Lord Justie TV ZB, and
			Sir E. RYAXN-
			ThI was an appeal from the Court of Commissloners for the cale of Encumbered Estates in the West Indies, and came beforo their lordships on a joint case of the appelsant and respondent. Tno question raised by the appeal was whether an orderof the Chief Commisloner disallowing the claim of the appellant to have a lien on the purchase-moneY of the Ano3 estate, In the isand of St. Vincent, ought to bO revereed or varied. The facts of the cse are shortly as folows3:-In 1823 Samuel Grestheed was tenant In fee simple of an undlvided moiety of the estate, subject to a charge of 600L. a-year by way of jointure to hli wife, who urvived him. He was tenant in tail of the other undi- sided moiety. He died In IS29, leaving two sons and two daughters, and having made a will by which he charged the entirety of tho estate with 24,0001. as portions for his younger children, and, subject thereto, devised the whole estate to his eldest son or such other son as should fErst attain tho age of 21 years, and the heirs of his body. His two sons, Samuel and John, were ap- polnted trastees of his estates and executors of hls wll. On the death of his father, Samuel, the eldest son, became tenant in tall of one moiety of the estate, subject to the charges created by hls fathers will, and to the jointure of M Greatheed, and tenant in tail of the other moiety free from any charges, except as a caso of election might be aised against him in equity. In 1830 Samuel Greatheed, the son, suffered a recovery, and barred the ental on boeth moieties of the estate. In 1833 a suit was Instiuted against him and the other members of the famlly by his brother John, for carrying into execution t.he trusts of the father's will, and putting Samuel to his electlon whether he would take under or against the will, and the blls prayed for the appointment of a manager. Samuel elected to take under the will, and a decree was made establIshing the will and directing the trusts to be performed, and declaring that the entirety of the estte was liable in equity to the charges of the will, saubject, as to one zmolety, to the first sbarge of the widow's jointuro. An amngenent was made between Samuel Greatheed and the paries, whereby he was permitted to continue in possession of the estae. In 1843 he mortgaged the plantation to Messrs. Da'$ and Boddlngton, Mr. W. G. AL Grant being at the tine in possesson of the estate as manager appointed by a power of attorney, executed by Samuel Greatheed L&amp; I83. Tbo produce of the estate was received bv the
			orztgees from the date of their mortgage, and sujplies forthplantation were sent out by them. The courso of dealing rees to have been that the necessary supplies were ordered by Grant, and he drew bills for the amount on S. !Gretheed, who accepted them, and sent them to Davis and rBoddlngton to be taken up and paid when due out of the iprocneed of the estate consigned to them. Graint, as mana- ger on the Island, made advances out of his own funds for
			,tb expenses of the plantation, and in 1845 a large balance
			;u due to him. ln that year Davis and Bodd&amp;ngton .&amp;cUned to make further advances and two bills �rawn by Grant were returned to him dchonoured. In con. jequenee of S. Greatheed having refoaed to be at the *expeso of sending out the necessasy suaplies to the estate, -communications took place between (Lant and John Great- teed, one of the encumbrancers, acting on behalf of all, with a view to provide for the continued working of the plants- Vion, and for the atisfact1on of the debt due to Grant, and for his reief from the liability to which he was subject in ruect of the dlshonourec bUIls. In this state of matters MholmGze_theed filed his supplemental bill in the Court of Chancery ginst al parties interested, praying to have the benefit of the former Buit and proceedings, to have what was duoe fo theencunbrances raised, and forthe appointment of a =ztsger and consignee. Grant contlnued in the manage- nt of tbh eeate as before, and corresponded with the qlnlntiff in the suit regarding it. On the 29th. of Juno, 58S, an order was made by the Court of Chancery directisg a trasfer of the mortgage of ?essrr.

			The case was heard by their lordehips some time ego -when Mr. Selwyn, Q.C. and Mx. Westlakeapae o h appellant ; and Mr. R. Palmer, Q.C. an d For the for the respondents.
			Lord KiEGSDowhN now delUvered their lordshi-' judg- maent, and, having gone over the facts of the case, esaid,- We will consider the case, first, as it stands upon principle, without reference to the authorites. Mr. Grant was origi-
			anly merely the agent and attorney of S. Greatheed, the son, the owner of the estate, subject to the charges. As sach agent or attorney he stood in no relation whatever to the encumbrancers; he was subject to no control on their pat, and liable to no responsibility to them for
			hr;-'management, on the one hand; and, on the other,
			Lo could have no claim upon them for any advances which he might make or hills which he might draw ln the discharge of the duties of his office. As against them he could stand in no better situation than his principaL. The owner of the estate continuing in possession could have no lai upn te ecumranersforanyloss which he mlght incur in the cultivation oftit. Fe mlght throw up the estate, if it was not equal to the charges, and leave the
			longed to it. -The enuhnestkngpssiocul
			not come on the owner for bygone profits, nor could he call uipon them to contribute to past losses. The decree of the o14th of December, 1833. does not seem to have wrought any material change In the positIon of the parties. The en- cambrancers were entitled (their charges being In arrear) to havo a manager and receiver appointed; but they waived that r1ht, and perm-itted Samuel Greatheed to remain In possesson upon certain terms speCfied In the order. As those termsz were not complied with, Samuel Greetheed remainecl in possession of the estate, in the same character Inwhich he bad previously held t_-vlz., as owner In fee, subject to the charges. There seemns to be no principle for holding as. a general proposition that the agent employed In ther manage gent of an estato in the West Indies by the owner of t
			estate, subject to charges upon it, can without more have a 3ien on the inheritance of the estate for the advances which lie bas made for its cultivation, nut only against his em- ployer, but agninst those whose title Is prior to that of his employer, and whoi have had nothing whstever to do with the expenditure. When atrustee Is Vc poseeion of the plan- tation, managing it on behalf of all parties, and employs a xmaager for the purpose, the expenses and proper advances of the manager for tha benefit of the estate are the 0xene and advances of the trustee, who is entitled to be reibred out of the estate, and if the mnanager were held enxtitled to be W~d out of the estate it would be as standing in tepreof
			oh ttustee who employed him. Againr, whenthCor of OJhancery take possession of the estat-e by theappointment of a manager and receiver, it Is by Its officers in possession on behalf and for the benefit of allprsn interested, parties to the suit, and its officers stand u atolneast as favourable a position as the officers appointed by trustees, and are entitled to at least as extensive remedies against the estate. When the authorities are examined, the question in what cases, and against what parties, and to what extent, a consignee is entitled to a lien on the corpus of the estate seems left la some degree of uncertainty, It Is laid down by Vice-Chancellor Shadwell, in ithe case of:'Farquharsoa v. Balfour" (S Sins., 211), that " wher- a aance is found dne to ab consignee on a final set. tlement of accounts he cannot be discharged until that balnc ispad, ndtha, f pymnt anatbe made with- purpoe ofdoin jusice o th conigne."fBth~ea doub
			in sue sausequena; case os - naavw(Yo.andColl
			EW.., 735), in which " Farquharson v. alfounr" was ited. In the subsequent case of "Morrison v. Morri- gon" (2, Smalo and Giff., 664) VIce-Chancellor Stuart was of opinion that In a soit Instituted for the adminl- ztratlon of a testator's estate a consignee appointed by the Court was entltlea to a lien on the corpus of a West Indian plantation for the balance duo to him not only a, Mst persons claimlng under the testator and parties to N.esnit but also against 3 mort"agee whose enouimbrance ws, a cLarge on the plantation pier to the interest o? the jestator himself, and who waS not a p3rty to the suit. The ground of this opinionis that the mortgaaeebhaving permitted the Courtto t3kepossesslonon behalf of-thoseclaiming nuder oth mort_gaor, witlhout bringing forward his claim, and
			i possession himself, as ne might have done. mnst be =oosidered to have acquiesced in and recogilza iuch pos. s,ession, and to be bound by tho result. This case was taken 17y spyeal to the Lords Justices, who affirmed the order, but npon lfferent grounds from those on which it had been pro- zounced, ana their decision cannot be considered as affect.
			%nsthe general question as to tho lien of a consignee of a Ivest Indian estate on the corpus of tho estate,-a question rDn which Lord Justice Tuner st3ted that he hadnever been Xoble to make up his mind. To this extent, however, the Cases all agree, that wheen the Court of Chancery has Xaien poession of a WVest Indlan estate by a manager and | onRigneo it will, as agsgnst all pasrties for whose benefit the
			Ion has been held, refuse to permit its officers to be = r6ed until the amount due to them has been paid. p3athe cass seem to go further and to establish that where Aheposes310onhas been held by t3e attorney andmanager of
			g ormgagora yet If the mortgees have so recognized the
			rtMronofth manager that he can be consdered asacting thelr behalf end for their benefit the same consequences %vlJl followv,j regards their interests, as If he had been ap-
			'tjted nrd the authority ot the Court. In the case of &gt; scott v. Nesbltt (14,Ves., 43), wshich is tho foundation of m subsequent authorities Nesbitt enad Co. were not con. }nuees uader the order of tbeCourt,when their debt was con. ,cted,aodide 39ranks fil that churcter at the time when
			iepad t.we b3nc diao to them. Ia th. case It was hid
			down by Lord Eldon that a West Indian estat ws not tel be treated asan ordmiry landed estate in England, bu was rather to be regarded as a trading concern, lice a mine or alum works, in which one tenant in common managing the. concern on behalf of the rest would be entitled to a lien on the shares of the others for what miight be dae In respect of the expenses incurredIn carrying onxthe trd4~. But one of the grounds on 'which he alowred the payment made bo Franks to theformerconsgnees, not only asagainstcreditors of the estate climing a charge under his vill; bat as against a mortgagee (who seems to have appeared by counsel, though mte particulars of his mortgane an not stated, was this-that those who couldl clatm lander the wil

Against this order Scott appealedw to Her Majesty in Caunnel; and his first reason was "1be- cause the respondents t rusted the appellant, and authorized him to consider himself as their agent mn the manage- ment of the plantation, gving directions through their attorney with respect to thle working expenses, and clirect- ing him to consIgn to them the whole produce, out of which such contingent expenses would otherwise have been paid." The respondents by their reasons insisted " that the appel- lant, being in possssion of the mortgaged premiseb as the
			attorney, not ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ o of therepnet,woaemtaes
			thegamon pofmanyexpese which hhy ene thad incurred,
			done."' With respect to the commissions, they insisted "-that such claim was sustainble onxly against Peter Reddin decewsed, whose attorney be was, and not against the re- spondents, whose attorney ho was not.!' The respodents
			reasons are sliged by Mr. Burge, and it Is pob-able, thre- fore, that he was counsel at the hearing, and that the points which he refers to the care as deciding were laid down by the Court; in giving judgment. The order, though it does not establish themIn terms, is quite consistent with suchx an hypothesis. The minute is in thLe handwriting of Vice-Chancellor Shadwell, and alters tho deeldion of the Court below boy direlcting " a general account of all the
			paymenra maae ny rne appellant wise he was in possession and management of the plantation under t&amp;e power ofattorneygranted by Beddin, and of what such costs, 4alms, and iosmands c asist particularly." It dismisses the appeal ns regards comnisslon, and reserves further direc-
			tfirnished by 'his authority toth, case ua,theclaimof Grant tobe considered as havlng been In possessl6n on behalf of the enctmnbrancers, and tnder the sanction of the Court, seems very strong. ee had beconme manager, no doubt, originally, as tn the ce of " Scott v. Smitb," under a power of attorney, executed by the owner, subject to the charge. But his contuance in that character had not only been acqutesced in by the encum- brancers, but had been Insisted on by t'hem as the con- dition on which thb owner should be permitted to continue in possession. The Court had sanctioned this arrangement, and had abstained on that ground froem appointing a manager and consignee. The case, therefore, In this respect seems stronger than either" Scott v. Niabett" or "Scott v. Smith." The queston whether the Court, at the instnce of a consignee, would order the balance due to him to be ralsed by sale or mortgage of the estate, when a sale or mortgage Is not required for any other purpose, does not in this case arise. The rule that the lien exists as against the Income of the estate has been extended to tho case where a portion of the estate has been converted Into money by the Legislature, substtuting for the slaves on the estate the com- pensation money awarded In respect of thecompulsory eman-
			cipation. The same principle seems properly applicable to a! case like the present, where the encombrancers, by procuring a sale of the estate, have put a stop to the profits on which the manager would have a lien. The trade, if that analogy be adopted, has in effect been sold, and the proceeds of the sale are subject to the clalms of those who would have had a demand on the profits while It remained unsold. On the ,whole, after a painful examinatlon of the evldence, and a fu consideration of the ease, their lodships havo come to the conclusion that Mr. Grant must be considered to have been in the management of this estate on behalf of aU parties interested, and under the authority of the Court of Chancery; and that the proceeds arising from the sale being now to be distributed according to the rlghts of the several parties having claims upon it, the aDpellant, as the executor of Mr. Grant, is entitled to be paid what Is due to him in respect of his management, in priority to the claims of the persons having charges under the wilL Their lordsh-ps, therefore, are of opinion that the order appealed from must be reversed; that the amount due to Grant's es- tate for principal and interest must be ascertained, and that the costs of the appellant of making his claim, and of this appeal, must be added to the amount, and paid out of the fund in court, and the respendents be allowed to add the coats to their security.

			LAW BEPORT.
			COU.RT OF PROB&amp;TE AND DIVORCE. MARCU 30.
			I- _ FILD V. FIELD.
			tlielorc &amp;Sr U. CRESSWELL and Special Jwries.1
			u�iie plaintiff propotinded the will, dated the 12th of January, 1855, andl the codicil, dafed the 8th of October, 1856, of his father, John Field. The defendant was tho widow of the decesased, anda opposed probate, on the grounds of undue execution and incapacity.
			The deceased was formerly a cowk-eeper at Walworth. common, and by the time of hisa deathi in July last had saved property to the amount of between 5,0001. and 10,0001. He was twice married. By hils first wife, wh o died In December, 1835, he had six children of whom the pglalntiff is zne. By his second wife, the defendant, to whom he was married in January, 1836, he had one daughter, named Catherine. He. hakd a good deal of house property occupiedl by weekly tenants and his wife was accustomed to collect his rents. Tfhoy had frequent quarrels on the sub- ject.of thes 'rents, in whiob he accused her of falsIfyIng her accounts. Ona tro or three occasions there disputess lead to her leaving the house with her dlaughter, hut she was per- suaded. to return. in January, 1353, he made a will, dividing his propet among his wife and children. In December, 1854, hmis wife a'aln left him, and In January, 18515, he executed another wi'l, deprlving his wife and her dlaughter of the benefit conferred on them hy the former will, and dividing the whole of hIds property among the children of his first wife. Mrs. Field returned to his house after this will was executed and sfIgned a memoran1nm as- knowledglng that she had severa times left him -About uAt cause. He had appointed his brother excautor to the wlij of 1855. HIs brother died, and in October, 1856, ha hiade a codicil, oppolnting another executor, and mnaking no change In the disposltion of his property.
			Some of the children of the deceased, -the attorney who prepared the will and codicil, the attesting witnesses, and other persons who had had business transactions with him were examiined, and sald that his mental faculties wvere in rio way impaired at the time when those Instruments were ezecutedl. HIls medical attendant, Mr. Blaxiand, said he had attended the deceased for seven years previous to his death, and the deceased kept his bed aU the time, although hahad no Infirmity which prevented him from getting up.
			The case of the defendcant was that for many years the deceased had laboured under an insane delusion that his wife and her daughter were in the habit of cheating him in the collection of therents. Tue defendant saId thathe had frequently threatened and Ill-treated her In consequence of this delusIon, for which there was nofoundatlon, and a mass of accounts extending over several years was produeed to show 'hat she had accounted fatthfuilly for all she rzeceIved. But she admitted that she had frequently when some of the tenants were in arrear borrowed money to make up her weekly accounts, in order that her husband might h ave no cause to complain, and that s'he had repaid the money so borrowed ont of the money she subsequently received. During one of her absences an old man named Cottrell, by the desire of the deceased, made an investigation Into her accounts with the tenanuts, but told the deceased that he wass unable to make outt whether they were corret or not. The decewsed was an uneducated man, said could onIy write his name.
			Dr. Deane Q.0., Dr. Swabey, and Mr. Prentice were counsel for the plaintiff; Mlr. Serjeant Sheo and Dr. Spinks forthe defendant.
			In the coure of Mrs. Field's examination hls lordship intimated a strong opinion that it would be impossible upon her evidence to establsh a case of Insane delusions, and tho learned counsel withdrew from the opposition.
			A verdict was accordingly entered for the plaintiff, and the will and codicil were admitted to probate.
			His LOPuDssiu refused to allow the defendant's costs out of the estate.

They i ived at Disahill, in Waterford, up to 1852, and then .removed to G1eii-l6d7e, Srear Carribk-on-Sulr, wrhere they. .remained until May, 1858. There were three chilidren of *the mariae-the elde3t, a boy,'horn in Juneo, 1849; the second, also a boy, born in NDovember, 1850; and the third, a girl, born in February, 1855. After their marriage they lived happley together nntil 1852. He then forbade her going to capel any nore,and abused her for beingaPapist, in the presence of the 3ervant man. He told her not to go to such blackguard and infernal places. In 1858, when his brother visited them, he was much enraged because the ser- vants were not at home, and etrapped her down, and after scolding her, struck her head againt the wal and broke theo canvass parotton. 'his brother spoke to him abont his un- kindness to her. On several occasdios he used violent lan- guage about her rIligion In 1s85 she was reading prnyers to the servants, w;hen ho esad he Rould have no - Catholso humbug going on in his house, and burnt theo prayer-books. In 1856 there wss a dispute about one of the children being sent to a Protestant clergyman, and she was

Sheo only married Captain Place on that unders6tanding They were all with her mother now. They had been baptided in the Church of Ryme, but not surreptitiously. Her husband was very anxious to have them educated by tho Roev. r. Drohugt, a clergyman of the Esablished Cherch; but she vwonld not consent. Her hus- band was very fond of field sports, and was frequenty out hunting. She sometimes, but not generally, dined with the children in the middle of tho day. Sho stvyed at the lodgings at New Ross for, abot a week, and then went to her mothers. She wrote and told her husband that, as she had obtained undeniable evidence of his adultery, she would no longer live with him.

			ADUIRA.LTY COURT. 3Atcn 30.
			- THE EIPRE BUGENE.-COLtSro'.
			(Before Dr. LUSHTNGTON and TnYrTy MASTK.1
			11115 was an action brought by the owners of tho schooner Jano Ann and Elizabeth, of Swansea, of 67 tons, against the screw steamer Empress Eug6nie, of Liverpool, of 425 tons, and 100 horse-pDwer to re-over for a total loss sustained by 3 collialon between the vessels, which happened in the Rock Cae,inte port of Liverpool, about three-qarter
			ofanpel, ine P north-west of tho Rock Lighthouse, on the mornlng of the 18th of November, 1859. The schooner was bound from a port in Glamorganshire, with a cargo of coals, for Liverpool. The steamer had a general cargo, end was on.a voyage from Liverpool to Fal. mnouth and intermediate ports, and thence to LonJon. The Jane Ann and Elizabeth alleged, that when proceeding up the Rock Channel, in the port of Liverpool the Rock Light
			house bearing about S.E., and distant about a mile, she was to the southward of midl-channel, close hauled on the starboard tack and beadinDg about ES.E. The mast- head light of the Empres Eug6nle was perceived close to the Rock Lighthouse, at the entrance of the channel. When first observed th. sI mer was on the schooner's starboard bow, bet whenr abeout 100 fathoms dstant the Empress Eogdnle appeared to change her course to starboard,.and ran with great violence stem on into the starboard miaships of the anae Ann and Elizabeth, at the fore side of her mainmaast.

			THE ELL.-SAIVAGE.
			On thle ilti of October last the smack Ellen, 70 tots, was fishing ab5out ten miles Off HlartIePOal When she was run into by the brig Two Sisters, of Newcastle. The slack William, and Ann, w,ith a crew of fivo hands; Was fishing near her, and sent two of them, CIlements andl Merriman, to her aeszst
			ance. It was alleged 6n their behalf that she 'had sustained so mush damage by the collison that if her crew had been left to themseuves she must have foundered; that by atop. ping uo a. leak and ~rcnderinf, other services, the two men of the William and Ann enaLbled her to be keot above water, andl the smack- Seb~astopol then to6klser in tow end brought her into Scarborouxgh. The ownersof the William and Ann were:also the owmers of tbhelien, andI they formed part of the erewot the Willim and Ann. The blame of the coUllsion wa4 admitted by the Twro Sisters~, andl her underwriters, being therefore responliblo for the consequential dzimac,_ten.

			owners and crew of the William and Ann thoe instltated the present salvage sdut4laiistS the Ellen; and tho owners and undermriters of the Two Sisters inutrvenedto defend it. The anle-of the property salved wasestimated at ro0o. and the action wasenterod-for2001r
			Dr. T srua, for William Bartlett, the master andcpart owner, and the other iwners and creowof the William and Ann, contended that the tender was insufficlent and that the crew of the smack ware entitled to sabstantial compen. sation for the loss of their weak flishing, valued at20&amp;, and for the work they had done on board the llen.
			Dr. SPims appeared for Willam Bartlett and the other owners of the Ellen -who also owned the Willian and Ann.
			Dr.TWI SS, Q.C. for the int4rveners, snbmlttedrthatitwas not competent to th owners of the Wiiam and Ann to sue the Ellen for salvage, because they werc also the owners of the Ellen, and idenffti of interest was inconsistent with every prlnciple on whic-h salvage cold be awarded or its paymnent enforced, With regard to the merits of the case, he contendedi that the tender of 153. to the two men w;ho actuaUy went on board the Ellen, and who were not her owners, was amply sufficient.
			Dr. LUIsrseGoON said there were two questions in the case-first, whether the owners of the Wilam and Ann being elso owners of the Eilen, cold' sue the Elen for salvage; and, secondly, whether the tender of 15D. to the men who were not owners of the EUen was sufficient. It appeared that the same attorneys at Hull instructed both theoprocter for the parties proceeding as salvors and the preator for the owners of the Ellen. HIe hoped and he was willing to believe that when the proctor for the owners of the Ellen received his instructions he was not aware of the true state of the case, because he strongly disapproved in- etructions being given by the sane solicitor to one proctor for the plaintiffs in a suit, and to another for the defendants. The underwriters of the Two Sisters having admitted their liability for the consequential damago to the Ellen, a suit was Instituted by the owners of the WiUiam and Ann against the Ellen, and, on the prayer of the owners of the Ellen, a commission was decreed to take bail to answer the action. That was a monstrous proceeding. They obtained a com- mission to take bail from themselves, as the owners of the Ellen, to answer a demand tnade by themselves as the owners of the vessel proceeding. It was a perfect farce; The proctor for the owners of the Ellen then made no answer to the claim for salvalge, hut submitted to the judgment of the Court;- and, if the eyes of the Court hed net been opened, the case would have been presented to it as undefended. But hew v;asitpossiblethat parties should sue themselves? How was such a suit to be conducted? What chance had the Court of ascertaining the true facts? If parties chose to sue themselves for their own amusement, the Court could not deny them that gratification ; but in this case, although the claim they preferred was nominally against themselves, it was really against third parties who were not orlginally before the Court. He had no hesltation in saying thit such a proeseeding was fraudulent, and that it was utterly impos- sible on any principle for the same identical people to be both plaintiffs and defendants in the same suit. In con- side'inc whether the tender of 153, was sufficlent he mrust treat this .as an crxe pote ase, because it nas impos- sible for theounderw7riters of the Two Slatersto obtain any evidence, the crew of the E llen being under the thumb of
			the parties proceeding. He had considerable doubt whether even the two seamen were enltlied to come before the Court, their master being one of the owners of the Ellen, but It was unnocessary to outer into that question, !and he had no doabt that the tender of 151.- was an ample reward for the services they had rendered. He should therefore direct the 151. to be paid to them, he should pronounco against the claim of the; parties proceeding, he should conde'mn the parties pro-. ceeding In all the costs inousrred on behalfbE the ownera and underwriters of the Two Sisters and ho should leave the proctor for th. owners- of the illen to-gbt his costs from those who had instructed him.u

			COUB2 OP BA KUP!CY,Basinghallslree,A March 30.
			IN RZ GEORGE MONTAGTZ EVANS.
			(Beforc.Mfr. Commissioner GOULB=ARN.
			The bankrupt was a solicitor of Farnham.
			Eis HoNoun gave judgment on the questiorkof cerilfi- cate. Tho bankrupt had not been p=sent at the hearing of his case, but Mr. Bagley had appeared to watch the case on behalf of Mrs. Evans. As misapprehension might prevail, he thought it right to state that it devolved upon the Court to appoint the certificate meoting, and that if a bankrupt chose to absent himself it was his own fault. In this case, howover, there was no misapprehension. The bankrupt
			-was a solicitor, and this was the second adjudication of* bankruptcy against him. The bankrupt got rid of the firat by paying the debt of the petitioning creditor, but another creditor having presented a petition the result showed how usoless such attempts were to elude justice. The bankrupt knew of the certificate meeting, because he had written to say that he shouid not attend it. To proceed to the merlts; the case was one which he regretted to say was becoming of frequent occurrence. The bankrupt was a money scrivener and also a solicitor. Heohad received large snms of money, and neglectd and betrayed the con- fidence placed in him, by appropriating the money to his own uses. Tho greatest confidence was placed in solicltors, especially-as Mr. Lawrence had observed-In country dis. tricts. In the country a solioitor was consulted on every occasion, and implicit reliance was placed on him, nartiun. larly in investing money. Many persons were under a delu- sion that no calamity was so great ss to get only 3 per cent. from the Fands; and the result of that folly thoy saw every day. In this case the bankrupt succeeded to the practice of his uncle, Mr. Shotter, a gentleman who was respected by every one. It was not long before tho bankrupt was bo- trayed into that whlch had ruined thousands-a love of speculation. He entered into building speculations, and moat wickedly appropriated the money of his clients to thoso purposes. The result was fearfal to contemplate. In the case of the poor peasant, BoxaUl, the bankrupt had appro- priated his little savings-all that he possessed in the world (1.90.)-in the most heartless manner that could be con- ocived. In the case ofMrs. Payne, her husband had retired from business with an ample fortune. Mr. Payne had placed the greatest confidence in Mr. Shotter, and he had trans. ferred that confidence to the bankrnpt, who was joint trustee with him for asum of about 20,0001. Itwas the duty of a solicitor under such circumstances to protect his co-trustee ; but the bankrupt, at a moment when Mr.Payne was disabled by illness had taken advantage thereof to commit a most grievous wrong. The account which Mrs. Payne had given with so much clearness, proprlety, and grace was this
			At a time when Mx. Payne was unable to attendto anything the bankrupt had visited bim with his two clerks. She sus- pected something was not right, and refused to leave the room for some time thinking he might be got to sign some- thing. At length, by desire, she wlthdraw, aud it was then that the deed of wickedness, as she believed, was porpe- trated,-that of getting him to sign apowerof attorney, and under whlch the whole of the trust fund was ultimately sold out. This was done when Ur. Payne was in a dying' state.
			I and incapable of knowlng what he was doing, and the two
			clerks had witnessed tho execution of tho power of attorney. By thh act Mrs. Payno had been subjected to a loss of 20,0001., and the anxiety of eight or nino Chan- cery suits. He scarcely ever knew a worso caso than this. Having referred to the proposed alterations in the bankruptcylaws, and expressed a doubt whether, In the bvent of cases like this being transfeored to a criminalcourt, such quibbles and technicalities would not be ,"ised an to render proscautions worse than useless, his Honourpro- ceededtostetethattho conductof thobaukrupthadbeenof the basest and mostwickeddes3ription. Nextin orderto thecase3 of Boxall and Mrs. Evans were those of Lawrence and Mrs. bierrlott. Tho bankrapt was trustee for Mrs. Merrlott under her nxarrlage settlement, and in'that capwcity he had
			gotMfrom her=3501. He hhd gone through the farce of givingI hor a pass-book, In which there was a sham account of ad- vances of money to Mir. Truman. Mrs. Merrlott's suspi- dons being excited ishe had gone to the bankrupttoake inquiries, when in reply to questions, he had said, "I am Mr. Truman; don't teD ofme;" 'Thi was the conduct of Mrs. Merriott's solicitor and trustee. In another case that of Stephen Pithei, the bankrupt had slmilarly pretended to advance 3001. to Mr. Truman, and when pressedfor an: answer to the question who Mr. Truman was he -had said " There-is no such person." In this transaction the bankrupt had plansibly stated that ho had kept 33. 12s. 6d. back for some trifling mat- ter, to give the transactlon the appearance of reality. Couldc Infamy go further? Then there was tho tesring of the seal off a bond in order to invalldate it-ani act wilked in the highest degree. Such conduct as that of which the banLrupt had been guilty was worse than If he had taken monoy by force, and ho was astondshed how any man could have been so heartless. A more cruel and heartless case had nover come befoYe the Court-one more thoroughly repleto with wickedness and fraud. The bankrupt was uatterly nworthy of a certificate, and tho judgment of the Court was that it be wholly refused, and without pro- tection.

Kincaid subsequently brought his action zgalnst the banzrupt for false imprlsonment, aud obtlaued a Terdict, but thg result the bankrapt ascribedto.thefacb of bisown counsiebeing absent. Kincaid now complained that the l3anhupt had veMatlously defended the action, and that bis trading had been of a reckless character.
			The bankr-upt, upon being examined, admltted that he had been bankrupt in 181, and insolvent in 1834.

			WO SHIP-STRET.-Mary Jane Cooper, the wife of a mechanic, was chargea with robbery.
			The prisoner, her husband, and chiudren had lodged for some time in the hotse of a Mx. Plerpoint, a, surveyor at Bethnal-green, whosa wife on MEonday week locked up some money In a cashbox, which box she locked np in a drawer fn her bedroom, and phaced the key oft&amp;e drawer in another drawer below it. On the folowing MondayMri. Pierpoint had occasion to go to her oasbbox, and immediately n,issed a 5e.-note wom it. This she told her husband as soon as he came home, and, as he recofUeted the number of the note,he wenat to the Bank, saw Mr. Bailey, one of the clerks, and from him learned that the note hod been paid in. On the note being produced it was found to he endorsed v,ith the nsme "Mainy Driffield," vhich he had some recoUiectUon of being the family name of the pri- soner, and, as this seemed to identilfy her with the theft, he consulted two constables, who went to his house with him, and the police asked permlss0on of the prlsoner to search her placo and boxes. ase prlsoner readily assented but the officers shortly found two scarfs which belonged o Mr. Pierpoint's on, and the prlsoner, on be2ng asked how shehadobtainedthem, declaredthat they had been given her by the prosecutor's daughter with other articles, for the use of her chlldren. This Miss hierpoint positively denied, as she now did also in evidence, and, while one constable was discovering a key in the prisoner's place which unloc1ked the door of Mrs. Plerpoint's bedroom, the other asked the prisoner IE she hod any objection to wrte dowl n her name on a piece of paper.

			A good dea of evidence was gone into relating to many robberies of sallors and others, and the money they had lost, and it was stated that a man who had lost a large sum of money in the vicinity of Rosemary-lane had committed snidde; that three Irish basket-girls, who pretended to sell orar gel and other frnib, had been convictedi of a robbery oE which they were innocent, and sentenced to a long term of imprisomnient and that the rea culprits were at large.

			fln WaS an action brought by the assignees of a Greek merchant, named Antonio di Demetrio, who became bank- Tupt in August last year, in order to try their rlght to a sargo of wheat, valued at 2,0001., for the benefit of the Credttors.
			Mr. Bovill, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, and Mm. fonyman were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Lusb, Q.C., 3r. J. Browne, and M1r. Digby represnted the defendant.
			- Hz. BoviLn, in his opening to the jury, id that they were about to enter into an inquiry oertainly of a much more extraordinary nature than had bdore bcen gone into during these assazes, and, as It appeared to him, of the very greatest importance, and to involve as much interest as the celebrated care of "Bogle v. Lawson," which they would remember developed a most extraordinary system of fraud upon the bankers of England and the Continent, and which zesulted In a testimonial being presented to 27w !7fiea newspaper for its efforts to crash the conspiracy that existed. Hle should mnake no apology for addressing them At some length, but he should endeavour to bring before them in as small a compass as possible the facts con- nected vAth this extraordinarycase, in order that they mightthebetter understandthe question that theywould uiltmately have to decide. Tho plaintiffsi in the actlon were the assignees appointed under the authority of the Court of Bankruptcy of a Greek merchant named Antonio di Dfemstrio, who carried on business in Union-court, Broad- street, and they sought to recover a sUm of about 2,0007., the value of a cargo that had been shipped on board a vessel called the Glori at a Russian port called Berdianskiin the BlackSea, and which arrived in this countryinthe month of Octoberlaat. This cargo was seized bythe messengerof the Cour of Bankruptcy, and ho should explain to them that Mr. Iloyd was merely a nominal defendant, the real parties tnterested being Messrs. Hall, extensive corn mer- chantsIn Cork, who had purchased the cargo of a lady named Manrtin; and the principal question was3 whether those gentlemenl were legally enetitled to the property under tht sale. The Messrs. Hall claimed to be entitled to the property through haviog purchased it ef this lady, and their case would therefore dspend upon whether she had a legal title, and when he had Lald before them the extraordinarycircumstances under which she was found in possession of the cargo of the Gloria, and also of another vessel, cailed the Bonverle, he believed they would come to the conclusion that she did not possess such title, and that she never was legally In possession of the property. In order to do this It was necessarn that he should first yive them aI
			short history of the banlrupt, Antonio di Demetrio. It seemedtha; hebadforsomeyearscarriedon business as a moerchant in Old Broad-street, and had connexion with other houses at Trieste and Alexandrin, and it appeared that Demetrlo speculated largely, particularly in corn, and that thesespeculatlons were unsuccessful, and he might state gencrally that the result of his operations was that he be- came bankrupt last year, owing to his creditors the sum of 60,0001., there being no assets whatever. He was exanmined two or three times, and upon his refusing on one occasion to anwer the question where he lived his object beingin all probability to prevent a search beSng niade there for property, he was committed. The necessary precantions were then, no doubt, taken, and upon the next raminationbhe gave the required information and was set at liberty, rand he almost immediately afterwards absconded
			and had never since been heard of. In the yar 189 tere couldbeno doubtthatAntoniodkDemetrioandhesbrotherheg concocted and carried oqut agreos scheme of fraud upontheir creditors. It appeared that they engaged a counting-houes at Gresham-house, and two others in the neighbourhood of Old Broad-street, at all of which, as he had no doubt he ghonld be able to satisfy them sham firms of business were lestblished under the names of Lebons and Co., Dalgo and So., mnd John Lambs. t^he bankrupt then advertised for vey to be employed as clerks at each of theso coteing-s Louses, and large quantities oE grain were consigned to tho oank rupts by their order, and It would seem that the clerks
			ad very little other occapation than drawing bills of ex- change. A new wam, it appeared, was also established at leghorn, under the tlUe of Merys ad Co., upon which all the pretended hrms to which he had alluded drew hills to a very large amount, and at this stage of the proceedings a brotheBof the prlsonerh amedNisholos di Denetrio, appeared spon the scene. Antonio dS Demetrdo WaS declared a bankrupt
			on thae 8t ofcugunt 18t5at the oth i rasatperiodntwor essest,
			caldte Gloria anoud th couvrie,dladen with grl o adin, p were on their way to this country, cousegned to them, and the bills of lading relating t tthem were 3n hia possession, and they appeared to have passed from ltto M�iss M artin, th o lady where namo he
			bad menp-tioed anThe carg o by thegh Gloriar waon thther resultsoldto lrh Haelal,thren other billsuppt of thI oelation poethe Bouverie, being also handed to him, as it would atp peas-, as security that the other transaction relating to the Gloria should be carried out. Both bills of lad'ings
			peared to have some must extraordinary oblterations uon them, and ho shoeld hve thounght that this would have created some uspcio in Dthe mind of Mr. Hall. HEe, how
			evr,appearsed trchavete purchasd theg bilof lading., after every litte iqury, tof MisgXs M-asretin, throuzgh a broker, and tlhe question now was whether that lady had an rght t
			the property. The case to 'ee roeght forward on the other
			ide by his learned friend In support of this supposition d'appeared to him to he a most extraordinary one. It was sald that one day, as Miss Martin weS walking in hyde-park, she metgLeboHs,whorepresentedfore ofat e tplaces of busness to which he bad referred, and who was intrrduced ro her by Lambe, and that she then and the.e agreed to purchase one of the cargoe5s of grain forl1,9S0l., and subsequently paid that amount in gold and notes, and a few days after. wards she purchased the second carg^o for 1,4001., which was also paid in gold and notes, and the bills of lading ere then endorsed to her by the pretended Leousrandhanded over to her. Thia was the story that would be told to support the defendant's title, and it agppeared to hi m that the jury could not believe It, particularly when they had heard the other circumstances connected wiSth this very^ exctraordinatry pro- ceeding. Hie should inform them that the ' le was tha
			lisMartin at this time had plenty of money, which she bad received from a counsn who had arrived from Caunaa but not the slightest information could be obtained as to who this, cousin wsza, or where ho had gone to, except that heo waLs at present supposed to be In Aunstralia3, and they had no means whatever of tracing the notes.or of testain^-the
			truth at the story that was told by this lady. If, as hha~d nso doubt she would he, this lady was called by his learned friend, they would hear her story, and would judge whether It was trne or not but hae shoeld ho In a condition to show that at the very time she professed to be able to deal with these large sums of money she wag, in point of fact, In a condition of extreme pecuniary difficulty, and in debt to a large number at tradesmnen, whose claims she was utterly un- able to liquidate, and the jury would than form their own conclusions whether they could possibly rely upon her evi- dence that the property in question bad come into her pos- essalon by a Loedasel l purchase He now came to another part of the case, which, It appeared to him clearly eatablished that the whole proce-edinig was a fraudut- lent one, concocted by the two Demetrios in conjunction -with Miss Martin rwho -otedastergn,fothpuoe of efrudig te cediorsof thins property. It appeared that for several years Miss M1artin hadl been on the moat in- tiaetrswith LNicholas diflemetrlo, the yrounger brother of the bankcrupt, and she hadl lived with him at two differant boarding-houses at Kensington and Bayswater. He did net maean to insinuate that any improper conuexion existed be- tween them, but there was no doubt that they were on the mnoat friendly and intimate terms. One of those bosrding- houses was kept by a married lady named Westbrookc, wit
			whomn Miss Martin was also on very intimate terms. There wvould be no doubt that veryv intimate relations existed be- tweenL this lady and Nicholas di Dametrio, and ho mentioned this because ho believed it was to becomie the aubject of inquiry In the Divorce Court, andl It would seem that Do- 3oetrio induaced the husband of Amr. Westbrook to go to Liverpool to manage another mercantile firm that bad been established there by him under the name of West- brook and Co., and for which he paid him a salary of 200. n year. Daring his absence Nicholuas l De- anetrio, Amr. Weatbrook, and Miss Martin continued to reside together In the most friendly manner. He shouldshow that MisaMartInconsulted Nlcholasdiflemetrio an her affeir; andl that she wras the means of introducinig bin brother Antontio to her solicitors, Messr. Bell, Cowdell, aud Co., of Abehorob-lane, and these would be all material circumstances for the consideration of the jury when they came to reflect upon the nature of the transaction that ultimately took place between Mfiss Martin and Messr. aflal. At the time the crisis approachaed a 3oung man, was introduced upon the scene, whose name was represented to be lAbous. He was a foreigner, hut who ho was or where b-e came from no one had 'been able to ascertain, and his case was that he was some connexien of the Demetrios and that. the scheme of making him the apparent owner oi the property, and pzissina it to Milss Martin, was merely a portion of the conspiracy that hadl been 'entered into for the Purpose of defraudinz the creditors of the K1-0'
			As he had informed them, both th - - f IrP

It seemed that, in con_ sequence of some threats of criminal proceedins, the bills of lading had been deposited with Messrs. Bell
			Cowdell, and Co., and on the 23d of August Antonio di De- aaetrlo went to the office of these gentlemen, accompanied by a person vwho represented himself to bc L~ebns, Brothers, wed tioy were given op.and on the same evening Laborus st2rted by the maU train for Dover, and had never since 'eeen beard of. Trhe learned censel then proceeded to state that upon an examination of the books and papers of tho bankrupt after the bankruptcy somo letters and entries Were found evldently intended to show that there had been a londfide sale of the property to this firm of Lebous, but he believed the jury would be of opin(on that those entries -were all fabricated for the purpose of deceptlon, and that no such peorson s.s the pretended Lebous ever was in exist- ence~ and that the whole proceedinge wvas a frand, in which every one who particin- tedl, Milss Mactin am-ong the rest
			vas folly cogniant ftu nature of thetransaction Mr. Devil then proceeded to cal' the 3ttention of thejury to son:o other facts connected with the proeeedings of th- Deme-r(0s, and he said that ho did not think It was Possible tbat they could lead to any other conclusion than that there lad been 3 most cnnng conspiracy by all these people to get posression of the proceeds of the cargoes of these two vessels, and thus deprive the creditors of the small vestige of property that remained to be distributedt among them. and that Miss Martin was put forward as the pretended dupe In the affair. The learned counsel, in conclusion said be could not help observing that Messrs. 'Hall, wvho weico the .Tel defendants In the action, appeared to him to have cera tainly acted with a want of discretion in making a purchase of a cargo of wheat of the value of 2 OCOI. from a lady, aa entire stranger, stopping at an hotel, without making the east inquiry, and particularly when the bilt of ladino bore
			the endorsement of Demetrio, a man largely engaged tn the corn trade, who they must have known had been declared bakrupt only a Ehort time before, and that this circum- stance was one of the extraordinary facts which the ijry would have to take into their consideration when they came to dtspose of the case.
			The following evidence was then adduced for the plain. tiff"s:-
			The formal evidence of the bankznptcy of Antonio was first pt in. It appeared that he was adjudicated a bankrupt, on hls own petit-on on the 26th of August, 1859, and that he stopped payyment mn the evening of the 8th, and the fact was announced in the City Artcle of Tc Times on the folloieng morn Ng a
			John Rathtry an intelligent lad, deposed that about three yenam ago he wa in the employment of the bankrupt. ThTe had only one other clerk. Tihe brother, Nichola
			used freonently to come to tha ofnpce, and ho nsed to send him welth lettrs to Young-sbreet, ensinegton. He used
			see three or feur ladles at that home. Besides going to the homeo atKensngton Ncholas Demetrio hadwsenthim with letters to s lers. Westbrook at BayLwater. He never saw a person named Lambe it the office, and anl he knew of such a person wastseeing his name uponrbills.

			Re-examined.-Jnst before the suspension of Antonio Demetiio a groat number of cargoes arrived. The bankrapt kept the books himself.
			Joseph fitodhart another la, deposed that In July, 1859, he answered an aaivertiserent for a clerk, and he wrote an answer addlressed to John Lambe, at No. 232, Greshaum- house, and received a reply, informing him that if he was willing to give his services for six months withont remune- ration he might call at Mr. Lambe's office on a certain lay. He dit so. The name of John Lambe was painted over the doer. He saw the bankrupt Antonio Demetrlo, who intro- duced himself as John Lambe, and he engaged him. Witness went to the office net day. He neve,r saw anyone except Antonio. Letters used to come addressed to John Lamnbe, und he olned them, and kept the keys of the desk. (This witness then gave similar evidence with regard to the hand- writing to the last.) The only employment he had while he was in the offloe was to fill up bills of exchange in different names. There were two or three books in the office, hut he never sew any one write in them. (A laugh.)
			Alfred Jones, another lad, deposed that In June, 1859, he was eng-aged. in a similar manner by the bankrupt at his own office in UJnion-court, New Broad-street. After he had been there a short time Antonio Demetrio asked hima if he would talce another plac, and he took him to an office with the name of Dalgo and Co. painted over the door. He un- locked the doers, and went In and unlocked a desk and took out some papers. The next day he took him to another office, where the name of Lebous Brothers and Co. was paitdu. e unlocked the door himself. There was nothin in-he office but a desk and a stool. (A laugh) He remained in this office as clerk- until the 23d of August. He had nothing to do. (Laughter.) All he did, at least, we to fil up bills of exchange In the form that Antonio Do- metrio dictated. After the stoppage of the fim of De- metrio he for the first time saw a person who was repre- sented to be L6bous Brothers. He used to come to the office a short time every morning and smoke cigars, and Demetrio told hima that he could not speak English.
			Mr. LUSH.-Hov did you occupy yourself then ?
			Witness.-While he was smoking I used to read a book.
			Mr. Cowdell, of the firm of Bell, Cowdec, and Co., solici- tors, Abchurch-Iane, deposed that he became acquainted with the Demetrios through theintroductlou of Slims Martin, and that the bill of lading for the cargo by the Gloria -was p laed n hs carg, Os te 2d o AuustDereetrlo, the banrut, am t Iss ffce,an dmanedtohave the bil and whom he represented to be Lebeus :Brotlhers.

			uross-examinea.--some years ag6 witness act as agent for Ms I Maxtin's solicitors, and obtained some property for her. Miss Martin was a foreigner by her mother's side, and abe was entitled to some property from abroad. At the time he referred to she received about 4001., and witness claLimed 4,0001. on her behalf.
			Frederick Smith, a detective, proved that he watched the bankrupt and the person represented to be Lebous, and that they were constantl together. Evidence was also given that on the t ii of lading was obtained from Messr. Bell and Co'. Lebons, as he called himself, started by the mail train for Dover. It alo appeared that on the
			same day a passport -was s'isd for Belgimm in the name of, Demetrno, and, that Domeriro and the person who repre- sented himself to Mr. Cowdel as Lebous went straight to the Consulate-office from Messrs. Bell's, and that the latter went in, hut no passport in the name of Lebous was granedt on that day.
			Mr. Raw, a solicitor, proved that on the 13th of Septem- her an peron who caled himself Nicholas Lebous came to his oic cond ina lstrcted him to prepare a proof of a debt for 7001. againt the estate of the bankrupt Antonio Demearno. He signed the necessy documents in the name of Nichol
			Labous. He only camo to his office once, and he never saw him adain. He was a foreigner and about 22 years old.
			A cle from the office of the plaintis proved that the amount of the debts of the bankrupt was 62,0001., and that atgrsent there was no prospect of any assets.
			roms-examined.-There were entries In the ban]urnpW
			books to show that there had been trsnsactlons betwoen him
			and the firm of Lebous Brothers, and that they had sold the cargoes of the Gloria and the Bouxverle to that firm, to cover a debt for money they had advanced.
			Mr. BOVILL called the attention of the Court to the fact that these entries did not appear to have been made with any regularity, and that transactions relating to the year 1858 had been mixed up with those of 1859.
			Evidence was then gien to show that Miss Matin had lived in the came house with NiTcholas Demerio and Mm. Westbrook for a considerable period, and that they were all on most intimate terms, and all the doruments were formally put in, and this closedi the case for the plaintiff.
			Mr. Lussa then proceededl to addres the jur in a most able speech. le said that Mr. Lloyd, whose name appeared on the record as the defendant, was only nominally so, and the gentlemen whom he represented, Messr. Hall and Co., who were gentlemen of undoubted honour and re-
			pctllabity wore the real parties interested in the result othsaton, andl he believed heshould be ableto show them that they had acted with perfect honour in this transaction, and that they were entitled to a verdlict on the ground that they had honestly paid their money for this property, and consequenitly were entitled to the possessionx of it. Messrs. Hall know nothing of the bankrupt. They had purchased this cargao in the ordi- nary way through the agency of a person of high standfing in the mercantile profession, the agent for Iloyd's at Cork and it appeared to him that it would be a hard thing indee
			lf they sould lose their money because otherpatties connected with the pr7orty might ho believed to have Racted in a frau- dulent and dishonest manner. In his view of the asee he said it appeared to him quite Immaterial under what circum- stances M.iss Martin became Possessed of these bills of ladinv.
			aUt ou3U sE WOn toEry snonicL tseceve that Aleggrg. Hell made the purcha.se without any k-nowledge of the fra.ud that might have been committed, their title to theproperty could not be Impeached by any one. He considerd that It was quite unnecessary to have occupied so mueh of their time in prov- ing that the bankrupt, and perhaps hfs brother Nicholas, had beein guilty of gross fraud. He (Mr. Lush) dlid not deny it. It was part of his case. What he sid wa that just before the bankruptcy Antonio Demetrio bad scraped together all the property he could, intendng to make away with it, and that he did so by eery means in his power. He should seubmit to thcem, howvever, that the saie to Lebous was a genuine transactio, and that the latter had got, these bills of lading for the paymaent of a debbt that was really due, and that Lebous and Lambe were really ex. isting persons, and he thought he should be able to prove that fact to the satisfaction of the ~isry, With regard to the pulrchase of tEl propei by Mis Martin, he said he ~ur4ifv0 that she was a lady entitled t&amp;donmiderable poet orrelationsabroad, and that a large somof money euaycmeinto herpossesslon about the time the purchzeo was|effected. As to her connexion with Nicholas Deme- tro, he said he was instructed that he should be in a posi- tiou to prove that it was merely accidentai, from the cir- cuamstance of their Hlvng at the same boaraing-house ; and, as to Antonio, that she had never seen b?m~ in her life. Whether or not Lambo was acting in coluasion with the bankrupt it was impossible for htm to tell, because he had left the country andt no one knew where he was. Nicholas and Antonio Demetrio were also gone, and it was Impossible to produce them, but he submitted that these circumstances ought not to operate to the prejudice of Miss Martin if the juary should believe that she had made a ben4 flde purchase of this property. If she had known there was anything wrong In the affai r, he wouald ask them whether she would have Tiept these bills of lading from Au-not to October, and a tohe nungto or todipos o5temn, he shoul~

Witness looked at all the papers, and told her that they seemed quite correct, and he wouid go into teYa city and makLe inqulreee,,nnd upon his return he avised her to sell the cargoes at once; but she replied that she would wait, as the market was rising The next day he again urged her to sell. .9
			Mi ss Mary Anne Bridget Martin was then examined. This witness wa ~setly about 40 years old, a very ladylike
			e aeher evidence with the utmost cool- nessandsel-posesson.Shedepsedas follows :-I reside at anaown-ro, Nttig-hll.Mymother was a Dutch lad, ad uon he eat ofmyparents I came into some proert, wllc Irecive in186. The amounkt I received the ws 1201. ddfrom Holland. I also derived some proprtyfro myfater about I,3001. I have asho some money inmy possession ?elonging to m'y sisters, who reside abroad. A part of this property was invested In Canada ; about 2,7001. of my own, and about 1,0001. of my sisters'. This money was placed in the hands of my cousin William Henry Martin, and he paid me Interest for it. I did not get the interest regularly, and I consequently called in tho prncpal. I usedl to resolve ten per cent. interest. My lncousin came to England on his way to Australia, and he gave me an account (produced), and he paid me at first 2,7001. anid afterwards he gave me a further sum of i,0001., and 601. for interet. I knew Nicholas Demetrlo from his lodgingIn the house Ivisted at. I first became acau,dnted with him about four years ago, when I was inx th; habit of visiting a friend at Kensington. I afterwards took- a house at Netting-bill, and furnished it at my own expense, and Nicholas Dsmetrio came to lodge with me there about three months. I had to bring an action against him for the amount he owed me for board and lodging, whfch was 591. I obtained judgment, and the money was paid. This was In 185$S, and he never boarded with me afterwards, but he has visited me occasionaklly. I know a_person named John Lambe. I first knew him In 1847. te us-ed to car on some business in London. In August last year I akdhim how I should invest the money I had to recive, and wished him to look out for an invest- ment for mno, and he told me that I could invest it In a cargo of barley, and that it woutld be a very good thin- for mne. I did not consent at first,, buLt on the 17th o? Au ft I did so, and bouoht the cargo by the BonLverl.e, aud" mbe brought me the 'lought note, and I gave him the money. The amoont was 1,4801. The signa- tures to the charter party and the bill of lading were both in the handwriting of John Lambe. I had no banker, but I
			ad out of the money I had received from my cousin. Mrs. lwVestbrook was present when my cousIn paid me tiae second amount, and she was aware that I ha receivedl some money before from him. I never sawv Antonio Dometiro, the bankrupt. When I paid for the first oago, Lambe told me he knew a friend who had a cargo of wheat to sell, and hbe thought it would be a batter investment tlmn the other and I should make more money by 1t. On Sanday, the 2lst of August, I and Mrs. Westbrook were walking in the park, and we met Lamabe accompanied by another gentleman, a stranger. M1r. Lambe introduced this stranger as the gentle- mnan who had the wheat to sell. He was a young man and a foreigner, bot could speak English. I told him I could not decide upon making the purchase before the 24th of Ausust.
			as pars ot tme money beloged to my sister, and I wal not yet aware wehrheould permit me to tse it. I received a letter from my sister, who was at Amsterdam, authorizing me to do so (let ter oduced). I saw Mr. Lambs again on the 25th of Augs, in company with Mr. Lebous, whio was Introducedl to me as the owner of the carg,o of wheat by the Gloria. This gentleman then produced the bill of la.7 lug and the other papers, and they both said they thought that the price of wheat wotLId go up. I thenx got the money and gave It to them, and they handed me thespaper. They were all ready prepared, and they were the same I after- wards hanrded to Mr. Hall. The amount I paid for this cargo wag 1,8991., sand I received a receipt in the name of L.ehous, Brothers. I never said a word to Nicholas De. metrlo la reference to either of these purchases, and I did not see either Lambe or Lebous afterwards. AMs. Weztbrook was present wphen I paid the money. I first saw that Dmetro was a bankcrupt by the nesapers and I consutdW Mr. Walker upon the
			sbet. Y had a letter from a person who introdluced me to Mr. Walker. I do not recollect who the person was, hut I understood that Mr. Walker had dons a good dea of, business for him. I subsequently went to Cork-, and I was aware before I went that Mr.Walker had written to Messr. Cummings in refezenco to the sale of the cargoes. I received a cheek for the cargo by the Gloria and drew out the whole amounat and took st with me to (~ueenstown, where I ob- tained a che-ck for 1,5951. on a London house, anid paid In 2501. to my own acroent at another hank-. I sent the check for 1,5951. to Mrs. Westhrook shortly after I received it, and she obtained cash for It and gave it to me when I re- turned to London. I left Queenstown on the let of Novem- ber, and when I got to London I remitted 3001. to my sister at Amsterdam, andi she sent me a receipt, which I produce. I also remittedI a sum of money to two other sisters at :Florence. I sent them 1501. each, I also lent 1501. to Mrs. Westhrook, and she gavol me the receipt now proclaced. I likewiEe paid 501. for furniture, and 2001. for rent and taxes, and 6001. was lodged in a bank In London in reference to these preceedings. I have never received a farthing of the Bonverle cargo. (A. number of letters relating to the mousy invested in Canada, and tLhe sums above referred to, were here put in end Identified by the witness. The whole of the letters appeared to have passed regularly through the post at considerable periods antecedent to the bank-ruptoy and to the purchase of the cargoes of corn by the witness.)
			At this stage of the case th Co!rt adjourned.
			learned counse then proceeded to comment upon the entries in the books, and he argaed that they showed clearly that there had been genulne~traussctlons between Lebons and the bankrupt, and that there was no reasonable douabthat thin c tgo by the Qiire lhad been sold toLehous and that he had
			Martin nnder the circumstances that would be laid before them.
			Thle following evidence wFas then given for the de- fendant:
			Mr. Roberb Hall deposed that he was one of the firm of Hall and Co., coru'merchants at Cork, and hso and his famDy had cariied on that basiness for 25 years. He remem- bered purchasing the corgo of wheat by the Gloria, through Messrs Cnmmings,- Lloyd's agents. The contract and in- voice now produced referred to the transaction. Tho pur- chae took pLace on the L5th of Ootober, 1859, and the amonnt witness paid was 1,9731. He gave two acceptances for this sum, and they were paid when they arrived at ma- tiity. The price that was paid was slightly over the market price on account of the guarantee of condition, and also his having purchased some wheat of the same description prevlously, which ho was very much pleased with. He took the guarantee because his firm were not acquainted with Mr. Cammings's principal. The bills of ading, the policy of insurance, and the other documnents con- nectewl wth the sale of the wheat were handed to him upon the completion of the transaction. It was not a commoon thing to fad endorsements cancelled upon a bill of lading, and witness made inquiries to ascertain who was the owner of the property of Mr. Cnmmings, and he informed hm it belonged to a Miss Martin, and he understood that she had been introduced to them. After the vessel had been seized by the messenger of the Court of Bankrupt7y, he made a complaint to Miss Martin, and she immediately hdged 2001., and a few days afterwards a further sum of 6031., and agreed to make up the sum of 1,0001. as security that witness should not be damaged by the proceeding. Wltness subsequently discosed of the cargo by the Bouverle, having previously glveTn a bond of in- demnity.
			Cross-examined.-Witness never saw a bill of lading in such a condition aa these blls of lading were. Hle was aware that Demetrio, to whom the wheat was consigned, was abankrupt, but he thought that the cargo had been sold before any act of bankruptcy was committed, He had never heard of MIss Martin up to this transaction. He was informed that the cargo belonged to a Miss Martin, who was staying at an hotel at Qeeeustown. He made no further inquiries respecting the lady. The agreement to make up the sum of 1,0001. was not completed by Miss Martin, and aU she paid was about S00t. He had never heard of tho name of Lebous, Brothers, before this transaction.
			Mr. Charnworth deposed that he occasionally did busess for Messrs. Cummings and Co., and he was instructed to carry out the transaction relating to the sale of the wheat to Meessrs. Hall, and he gave a cheek for the amount, less the dlscount, to hMsa Martin. He gave her his own check.
			Cross-examined.-The lady was brought to him, and he made no inquiries about her. Mr. Tom Cummings intro- duced her to him. In the course of the sale he heard that the consignee, Demetrio, was a bankrupt. The documents were quite in order, and he thought It was all right. The amount was paid by one check. Messrs. Hall's acceptances were gven to him afterwards. The check now produced was to one paid; but he had not seen It untU the present time. Witness did not consider the lady was a perfect stranger, as she was Introduced to him by xr. Tom Cam- mings. This gentleman was stll living at Cork.

I don't think I saw him in 1858, but I think I saw him once In 1857 in Kensington-gardens, but I am not seur whether it was 1856i or 18o7.

I believe I paidaltogether about '6001. The money came from Holland. I wroto for the mcney, and got it from my sisterby means of Dutch bils of exchange. I only paid 2501. at first,a auI did not pay the rest of the money untSi some time afterwards. During the last- four years I think that sometimes I could haTe obtained 1001., and at others I could not have done so. There was a fire at tho house at Kensington. I purchased the goodls after the fire. I do not remember that the fuLr- nit.re was Insured for 1,600!. Mr. Demetrlo insuredl it, hut I don't think I advised him to do so. There were some pictures in the house that were purchased by Mr. Demetrio, and a portion of them were bmat. The fire took place a day or two after the policy w,.s effectedl, and a claim was made for 200L7, which he offic ressted, and they ultlmately paid 1501. 1 was examined as a witns. I do not know whether the 1501. that a sm paid was toD inmsu coats. I don't remember that I swore, i vhen I was eamined.
			that I told Mr. Demetrlo to be sure to assure the ptuores rI will not swear tILat I cdid not also say tho,adt I we agreed upon 6001. as the prlce of the
			.icturcs. My total income was about 4001. a-year, Vigtsometimes It was mere. I made a profit by mt lodging-house generally, but in 1859 m lost money. I cept no memorandum of the. money I received from Holn lad or from my cousin. I kept no accounts at alL. I re- ceived 1501. of interest in April, 1859. I had no banker. I always used to keep my money in the house, and, if I could get gold, I always preferred it. The largest' sumI ever had Dnk tathoser eto August, 1859. ws 1501. I am unable tD sayatlw hat particuelar period in 1859W was in possmion of 150!., bufre trinklI had that smatChrIstmas, 1858. newas indebted to tradesmen at the time I purchased those car- goes, and I remitted the 2001. to Mrs. Westhrook to pay them. I am aware that some of the people to whom I owed money wera in attendance as witnesses at Kingston. In August, 1t59, a owed my laundress 71. Is. for washing,, but she has clothes of mine to a larger amount, whichlthe will not give up. l will net swearlIdid~ not pay her 11. on account in July, 1859, and 7s. on accouint sn August. Lodgings in Craven-street,Blayswvater, were occupied by me, and Mr. Nicholas Deimetriel used to visit me there, and Mrs. Westbrook camae with him, and I used to receive letters for her inthe name of Drinkwater. She also used to pass by another name, which I do not wish to disclose. If I went to a, shop I used to give the name of Drlnkwater. I used to.- personify the name. Mrs. West- brook also used to go by th. name of Turner. She did so when she lived in Young-street, Kensington. I always called her by her right name. WhenaI was examined at the former trial I may have sworn that I never knew that she went by the name of Turner. She may have gone as Me-. Smith. That is " no name." (Laughter.) I may have done the same when a cabman has been insolent an
			wanted my address; I may have said, "M1rs. Smith, Lans- downe-road."1 If anyletterscame addressed tothe name of Smithl ued to take them Iaand open them. I swear that
			i never myselt introduced Irs. Westbrook as Mrs. Tmrner. I remember some boxes coming to the house in Craven- terrace addressed in the name of Drinkwater, and those boxes were afterwards given to Demetrio. After I left thome lodgings the landlady applied to me for renb that was due. The amount was only 5t., but It was not convenient to me to pay il at the time. This was In March, 1858, and the money was not paid until November, 1859, because, I am asbamed to say, I had forgotten it. To the best of my recollection they were not constantly applying to me for the money tbatwas due to thema. (A.letter dated July, 1859, addressed to the lady in questlon,was put in, In which the witnes3 said she was ashamed at nob having before patd her long-standing debt, bub that she would see her on the following week.) I did not pay her on the following week. I did not say I should do so. I merely said that I would " see" her. The debt was afterwards paid by instalments. I did not owe lOt. to a grocer at Notting-hilL H eaid that I owed him that sum, but I did not. The time was not out. It was arranged that there should be a quarterly account, and he wanted the money before the quarter had expired. I consulted my lawyers, Messrs. Lanfear and Stewart, upon the subject. I consulted them upon other occseions, butI never had any groat fancy for la6wyers. (Laughter.) Iusedtolikefresh lawyers.
			Mr. BovIL.-Who introduced you to them ? Witness.-Clrcmstaunces. (Laughter.)
			Cross-examination continued.-A law stationer intro- duced me to Mr. Walker. I don't know his name. I only know him by going to his place, buLt I cannot say who he was. I introduced Messrs. Baell, Cowdel and Co. to Nich ls Demetrio. Although I was acquaintea vith those gentlo men, and also with Messrs. Laafear and Co., I thought it right to aply to Mr. Walker in reference to these bhlls of lading. don!t know where the law stationer lives who introduced meto Mr. Walker. It was Oxford-streetor Holborn way. I borrowed a directory, andI could find the place now in a moment. I tblnk the law stationer lived u acourt. Ihave employedanothersoUcitor, namedBlake.
			0 lived in Carlton-chambers. I have also employed a gentleman named Young,who lives in the Strand. While T was living in Lanadowne-road I was sued by a butcher named FarneUl, but Iswear I did not keep out of the way to prvent
			thewrint moeIng searved Ajudgment foro 201- was obtained againste me. Ind March, 1859 I owed a grocer 191. for groery an vey lkel I ut ernoff I was very
			saorr ox money at tOhs time. i swear he did not re- fuse to give me any more credit, and insisted that the bflls should be paid weekldy; but the bills may have been paid weeldy after that. The reason I did not Pay was that I was speculating with my money. In July 1859,I owed a butterman ll., and Ishotld think he applied for it every Saturday night of his life. (A. laugh.) He sued me, and I would not pay him, in order to punish him. (Lsughter.) It is very probable that be wa not paid untl
			after I bad received the money for thoso cargoes from Ireland.
			The Court here adjourned for a short time, and upon the return of the learned judge
			Mr. LusHs complained that Smith, the detective, had insulted the witness, Miss Martin, and he called upon his lordship to interfere.
			n answer to a question put by the learned JuDGF Miss Martn said that Smith had followed her about wherever she went.
			Mr. BoviLL inquired whether she was not directed not tD communicate with any of the witnesse, and whether she had not been speakdng to Mro. Westbrook?
			Miss Martin said that aU she said to Mrs. Westbrook was to tell her to go away.
			The cross-examination was then resumed. The witness sald,-About this time I owed money to tho baker and the fishmonger, but they did not refuse to supply me any longer uponred it I paidl them after I got the money In I land. I have heard lately that upon one occasion Mrs. Westbrook accepted a bill for 4001. in her maiden name. It was aboutt the time of the trial with the Sun Fire-office. Mms. Westbrook told me that she had signed her maiden iame to a bi for Nicholas Demetho, and that she had dono the same thing before for her htsband. Mrs. Westbroolk has been livmn with me for some time, and she pays me money when a7a can. She is in bad cir'cumstances, and she has brought me into difdicuLlties. Upon one occasion I pawned same plate for M. Westbrook. I don't know that this plate belonged to Demetrio, hut it was in the house. I3 wil not swear I have not pawned plate twenty times. I don't know whether it was Oemotrioas plate or Ma. West- brool's. It was al so much in common that I could not teR which belonged to eat3h.

I recollect now I am wrong in eaying this. I did live there before I went to Ireland. I am not at all acquainted with the value of grain, but I lookod at tho newspapers at the market price, and I relied entirely upon the repre3entations that were made by Lambe to me. I had never bought a cargo of corn before, and I have never bought one slnce, but I hope to do so. I remitted the money to my sister at Amsterdam by half banknotes but I do not know the numbers, or the dates, or any of the particulars of those notes.
			Re-examined.-Two gentlemen named lVwsey an Ash. croft saw my cousin at my house. He was angry with me at my calling in the money, as he wished to speculate with it in Australia. I have seen all the tradesmen that have been mentioned in Kingston in company with the detective and I know that he has been inquiring into all my affairs Mr. Iambe is a very nice-looklng young man, but looks rather consumptive. Nficholas Demotrlo is a very different lookingman from Mr. Lambe. Lebous was quite ayoungman not more than 22 years old. Ho could speak English. i was examined upon these matters in the Baulerupty Court last November by the assignees in bankrnptcy.
			By Mr. BOVILL.-I have employed a detective myself to endeavour to discover the waiter of the anonymous letters. I have received several others besides those that have been produced.
			fr. Ashoroft deposed that he was a medical man, and was acquainted wlth Miss Msrtin, and also v;ith Nicholas Demetrlo. He remembered being at Miss Martin's when her cousin was present, and ho saw that some business matters were going on and he went into another room. The gentleman was introduced to him aiS iss Martin's cousin, reom enanaa,and it v;as stated that he was going to Australia.
			Cross-examined.-Witness never saw the gentleraan either before or since. He could not say whether it was in the morning or the afternoon, but he should imagine it was in the afternoon, WMitness was onintato h2mes thyicypbW
			Demsetr1o, but he did not remember that he had permn!tte

			w r. IL H. Lawssy, nephew of Mrs. Westbroous, deposed that in Augnst last he remembered a gentleman coming to the house in lansdowne-roA, and inqiringorM iss Martin ane lthe 6en, ad oetohe offuired for Antnioemetrand said that

			Mr. Terry, the manager of the Unity Joint-Stock Bank, deposed that in June lat a foreigner caed upon him and wished to open an laount In the nkame of Lebousc Br ther Heasked for an introduction, andhesaihathetwasrd5 on to Antonio Demetrio. At this time the firm of Deme r
			was in fair credit. bWitnebs sd he would maker inqrnBes, and he sent a clerk to the office of Antonio Demetri, but he could not meet wDth him, and on the follovig morning two persns,t who representeda tbemselvesasAndrewandticholas

			account. The various documents, bill of lading, charter-.j parties, bought note, bls of exchanMg &amp;o., were then putlI to the witness, and he expressed his opinion that the slign- tures of Lebous and aU the others were in the handwritin of the person who called himself Nlic'holas Lebaoue, and he said that he should have paid cheies to sue aehandwriting.
			ln answer to questions put by on. BOVILL it appeared that 2001. woe paid in at first, and that afterwards an ac- ceotance of Antonio Demetrio-was, discounted. He was afferwards asked by Lebons to discount othier acceptances of Demetrio's, but he deolinedl to dlo so and it ap- peered that Demetrio had found the cash ior the so. count that was opened. In August It seemed that all the money to their credlit was about 41., and they sent a cheek for 5lu, which Mr. Terry directed to be returned and a check was then sent for the proper balance, and this was patd and the account closedl, and nothing more -was heardl or seen of Lebous, 7 Brothers, by Ar. Terry, This gentleman also said that he dlid not know either Antonio or Nicholas Dametrlo, and for aught he could say to the contrary they might have themselves been the parties who opened the as- count at the hank in the name of Lebous. Brothers.
			srs. Ann Westbrook waS then examined, and sbe stated that she had been acquainted with Mims AIartin since 1851, and that she first beeame acquainted with her through her cooming to board with her. She said that they afterwards lived together at the house in Young-street, Kensin ton, and subsequently at Lansdowne-road, Bayswater. licholas Demetrio was also a lodger. The witness then stated that ehe remembered hearing of the vlslt of Miss Martin's coasin in Augnst last, and deposed to the fact of her showing her a bag containing a sum of money and bank notes and gold after he had left.
			This witness was severely cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant BALLA1TAINE with reference to mauny of the matters that had been brought out in the course of the cross-examina- tion of Miss Martin. She denied in the oDurse of her evi- dence that there had ever been any improper intimacy between her and Nicholas Demetrio.
			Mr. Stall, ianaging clerk in the employ of Messrs.Young, egble, and CO., corn merchants, deposedthatJu the month of June last year that firm was In negotikilon with the hankruot for the Durchaso of the cargo by the Gloria, Messrs, Yonng were only willing to buy 800 quarters, and,as the cargo eonelsted of 1,100 quarters, they dedlined to pur- chase so large a quantity, and the endorsements on the blls of lading were, consequently cancelled as they now appeared.
			This concluded the case for the defendant.
			The learned counsel then severaUv addressed the jury in summing up and reply.
			Lord Chief Justice ERnv summed uLp briefly, but at the same time placing clearly before the jury all the material points In the evidence on both sides. He said it appeared to him that the only real question they had to decide was whether or not the sale to MLss Martin was a bond fide one, and he should say that in law, although the bankrupt might have Intended to cheat his creditors, s ud the ry should think those bills of ladiDg were given to bLeous, or whoever ho might be, with that object, stll if thely should be of ophinion that it was a, bonct 11dc ptLrchase by 3issaxtn for value, she was eutltled to the pro erty, and thls single question was the only one they bad to Tcide. The css on the part of the plaintiff was that the whole proceeding was the result of a conspiraoy to which Miss Martin was a party, and he must say that the eireumstances connected with the alleged sale were such as most necessarily create a strong suspicion in the mind of any man who heard them detailed that this was the case. They had, however, heard the evidence of that lady; they had seen how she had borne the tevero and searching cross-examination towhich she had been subjeoted without, as it seemed to him, faltering in the slightest degree, or evlncing any consciousness of guilt, and it was for them to decide, under sll the eircumstances,which side was entitled to credit.
			At half past 6 o'closk the jury retired to condder their verdict, and in about an hour and a-hal they sent a message to the learned judge to the effect that there wasno chance of their agreeing. They remained in deliberation until 9 o'clock, when Chief Justico ERnL, finding there was no apparent chance of their coming to a dedsion, leit the Court, and directed that If the jury did not agree by 1i o'clEck theywere to be discharged.
			At 10 o'clock an intimation was given that they had 3greed,sand shortly afterwards the jury came into court and returned a verdict for the plaintiffis.

			Mr. Preston prosecuted, and Mr. E. Ma. Fenwick- de- fended the prisoner.
			The statement of the case on the part of the prosecution disclosed a melancholy instance of depravity aris-ing fromin- temperance. It appeared that the deceaeedman CarIlsle, wvho was a dock labourer and lodged with his wife in a room in the prisoner's houEs, had at the same time given way to very drunken habits, and when in that state his widow said he -was very hasty and on coming hnme would.

The evidence, to hsis mind, brought the charge hmom conclusively against them both. He could hardlly restrain himself to express an opinion of their conduct in moderate terms, it had been so brutal, so Inhuman, and so destitutet of every spark of humanity. He should feel it his duty to pars on them a very severe sentence as a waning to all others that children were not to be, so treatedl with lonponity. The sentence of the Court was, that they be eah Imprisoned for two years writh hard labour.

			Mr. Phear prosecuted; Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Drakc dlefended.
			It appeared that Carroway was the treasurr of the Loyal Leicester Lodge of the Mfanchester Unity of Odd Fellows at Wells, in Norfolk, of which society the prisoner was a mLember and trustee. At a meeting of the society held in July last it was arranged that a saum of 401. should be paid Into Messrs. Gurneys bank on account of the roclety. The money was paid over to the defendant for that jmrpose, and it was proved that he left the room with it In his vossession, and that it was never paid into the bank.
			It appeared that there were large defaicatrons with re- pect to the funds of the soCiety, and that the prisoner had expressed a wish that a meeting shold be held. This was 'not done. The defenee was that the prisoner's conduct showedthathehsd no frauddulent intention innotpaying sver the money, and a technical objection was also taken that the property wias improperly laid in the treasurer of the suclety, and that the prisoner, being a trustee could not be guilty of larcenyin appropriating the money of'the society.

			ISi PBRIUS CouRT.-(Refore the LORD CHiEE JUSTiCE.)
			NIX V. SMrfm.
			This case, the partlculars of which wo published yester- day, was concluded after our report was despatched. The action was brought to recover damages for the seduction of the plaintliff's daughter by the defendant, a preacher in the congregation of 1formed Weeleyans at Whittlesea, In the Isle of Ely.
			The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE summed up the evidence with great care, pointing out to the jury the extreme im- probability of the girl's story as to the circumstances nuder which the alleged seduction took place ; his Lord- ship however, said that, though they disbelieved this,
			if tAey thought that a criminsl �ntercourse had taken place between the defendant and the girl, and the defendant, though not her original seducer, was the father ef her child, they might stir, find a verdict for the plaintiff;- but that probably, �f they took that alternative, t&lt;hay would consider that It was a case calling only for a moderate amount of damases. On the other hand, if the defendant vas the corruptor of the girl's chastty, it was a case of the greatest aggravation, balh from the relation of the parties nr d the line of defence taken.
			The jury, after consulting for about half an hour, returned a verdict for the Plaintiff. with 50f. damanes.

			NISI 1 RI IS COURT.-(Before thc LoBnD CimEF JUSTICE
			and a tYnamen .T,,r,,1
			CORY V. BON-D.
			ibis case, which was concluded at a late hour yesterday evening, was an action for a. libel which appeared in the Norfolk News last October, of which the defendant is the editojr.
			Mr. O'Malley, Q.C., Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Couch ap- peared for the plaintiff; Mr. Power, Q.C., and Mr. Kieane for the defendant.
			The action arose out of proceiedings taken by the plaintiff, who Is clerk to the magistrates for the East and West Flegg division, in this county, and owner of an estate near Great Yarmouth, against a Mr. Fabb, a landowner residing at Ennham, in the same neighbourhood, for a trespass in pur- suit ogame upon lands in the occupation of the plaintiff a-nd of M. Rs. Monsey, Mr. John Cobb, and Mrs.An Snowley, on the lot of September last.
			At the hearing before the magistrates only one witness was caled by the plaintiff in support of the information for trespass upon hls own land, a litt e girl of 11 years old; but, rs Mr. Fabb positively denied having been on the plaintiff's land, the magistrates dismissed the summons. The Inforrna- tiona which charged a trespass upon the lands of Mersey and Cobb were dismse upon a technical objection taken by Mr. Fabb, and that relating to Snowley's land was dis- missed on the ground that Mrs. Snowley was not showvn to be the ownerof the property. A week or two afterwards s letter appeared in the Norfolk lThns from Mr. Fabb, in which, after an allusion to the above proceedings, it was
			n andshted Sir, rewasl realcannot wondener at the hostility which is
			on,onl tevincedat the Game Laws whetten I hme o much wicked or, haision nuder cover of them. Indeu Itt i traly moestrous that a hsmagtwatsno clerkn, to gratify his ow obpiteful feelincd and perbonal vtaee, should he rermitted to resort to proceedins like the Ip n

			The publication of the libel king admitted, Mr. Fabbh was caled, and stated that he was the real defendant in this as- tio, the letter having been written by him. He admitted
			i been oul t shoohthis on the lot of September, and that be wasupon the landsyof Money, Cobb, and Snowley, but s rid that he was so with the permission of the owners. In thiL he was corroborated by Motey, and also by Mr. Snow- ley, but there was come dispute as to whether ho or Mrs. Snowley had a riht to grant this permission ; and it appeared that Mn. Sue wley had not given hers. Fabb, however, had sported on this land for upwards of three yeha without interruption. Cobb was not calUed on either side, but it was proved that he had met Fabb on the mnorning in question on hs land, and that Fabb had given
			tim a rabbit. It was also proved that a ir. Lucas and some friends were shooting by the plaintiff's permisson, an his land on that day, andit was suggested that the little

			3mr. rower, QC.u., 'ua .Ar. ieane Nere tor the plaintiff; ?sfr. O'hMalley, Q.C., Mr. Palmner, andI Mr. Couch for the, defendant.
			This was a cross actionL for a maliclous prosecution arising ,out of the same proceedings, and wvhich the learned counsel ADn either side agreed to leave to the decision of his L-ordship upon the evidence in the former action.
			His LoRDSIIIP Said that be had no hesitation in saying that the proceedings taken by Mr. Cory were altogether fim- proper. There was no reasonable or probable cause for Iy. Ing the information against Mr. Fabb. The most plausible c,ase was that which related to Mr. Cor-y's own land, lint, looking to the tcnder years of the only witness called before the magistrates, and the extromeprobabllityOf mistake, the Eroceedings were, taken altogether, not orgy unwarranted, Lut vexations and rash. He regretted tbn;t a person hold. Ing the position of a magistrate's c'lerk should have taken such proceedingss. Mr. Fabb, however, haid not eonfined liimself to his legal remedy * he had etteckod Mr. Cory fn the public press. For so dolng his Tei.is did not blame. ,Mr. Fabb, but it was a matter for ,jon3~dezatfon in this ac'ton that Mr. Fabb had so far taken his om rwemedy. For that attack Ur. Cory had brougbt his action, and bad been
			oriinally defeated. Considering, therefore, that Mr. Cory lie been already punished to some extent, he should award in this case a verdict for theo plaintiff, with 301. damages.

The galant General, during the period of his command at Portsmouth, has gained the respect and esteem of all ranks and classes, and will be accompanied by heart- felt wlshes that he may long be spared to fulffl the duties of tha high office to which he has becn appointed. Major- General Lord W. Paulett, C.B.,'will arrive at Ports- mouth andassume the command of the garrison and district this day. His Lordship afterwards proceeds on a month's leave.

			The remainder of the troops who arrived at Gravesend from Calcutta in the East India troopship Marlborough, Capt. Eer, reached St. Mary's invalid establishment, Chat- ham, on Friday evening, and joined the detachment that ak.! .ed on the previous day. The total numher of troops who came home in the Marlborough was 295. At the time the Marlborough left Calcutta there were several other vessels in the river waiting to embark troops for England. The Warrior Queen, with troops on board, arived at St. Helena on the came day that the Marlborough left that island.
			A teegraphlc despatch was received at Devonport on Friday evening by Port-Admiral Sir Barrington Reynolds, KC.B., instructing himto have that portlon of the Chanmel squadron now at Plymouth prepared for sea Immediately Sealed orders came by post on Saturday morning. Thel. destination is unknown, but Gibraltar andMalta are spoken of. The Conqueror, 101, Capt. Sontheby, C.B.; the Trafalgar, 90, Capt. Edward Fanshawe; the Centurlon, 80, Capt. George E. Patey; and the Diadem, 32, Capt. Cockburn, were in the Sound on Saturday. The Con- queror has a leak aft, which was attempted to be stopped by transporting her guns forward, so as to raise her stern out of the water ; but, this mode having failed, it then be- came necessary to put her into dock,and her powder was dis- charged accordingly. Steam was get up on Saturday, but the weather wassobolsterousthatCommanderThoMpson,theHar bour-master, did notdeem it prudenttoattempttotakeherup Hamoaze. No.3 Dock-at Keyham Steam-yard is prepared to receive the Conqueror, and arrangements havebeen made to admit her to-morrow. The Trafalgar is short of able seamen and petty officers; her crew, a large propor- tion of whom were obtained in the Thames, are not yet well-digscplined. It became necessary, a few days since, to disrate three petty officers-a very unusual punishment. A Master from the screw
			steamship Revenge, 90, at Devonport, has been lent to the Trafalgar, by which It Is concluded that she is not going to any very distant station. The crew of the Diadem were exercised at great-gun target practice on Friday. The Royal Albert, Aboukir, and Donegal are ex- pected daily at Plymouth from Lisbon.
			In accordance with Admiralty orders, about 40 ship. wrights and 20 labourers, selected from the number hired during the busy period of last year, were discharged from Chatham dockyard on Saturday afternoon last, the Board of Admiralty having directed a very large reduction to be made in the number of hands at that establishment. A similar number of the hired mechanics and labourers vill be dis- charged on each Saturday until the number of men on the establishmenthasbeen redueed to that ordered by the Admt- ralty for the present financial year. The shipwrights discharged complain that they have been unfairly treated by the Admiralty, as at the time they were induced to leave their employment with private firms to enter Her Ma- jesty's dockyard they were led to believe that their services would be required for two or three years.
			The line-of-battle saling ship Powerful, 84, belonging to the reserve at Chatham, is ordered to be taken Into dock to be lengthened and converted Into a screw steamer.
			The Torch, 5, screw gun vessel, will, according to present arrangements, be undoesked at Chatham to-day, when she will proceed to Sheerness to join the steam reserve.
			The screw frigate Galatea, 26, 800-horse power, fitting at Chatbam, will be ready to be undocked on Thtrsday next, when she wiU proceed to join the seceond division of the squadron of the steam reserve.
			The Castor, 36, training-ship, Is expected to leave Chat- ham on Wednesday for Greenhithe, where moorings have been laid down for her.
			Capt. Inglefield's (No. 1) and Lieut.-CoL Dixon's (No. 2) batteries of the 3d brigade, now stationed at Plymouth Citadel, are under orders to proceed to the Channel Islands, to relieve two batteries ordered to Portsmonth, where they will do duty for two batteries of the 3d brigade who are to join the head-quarters in the Citadel.
			The screw steamship Nlilo, 90, Capt. K. Barnard, was towed down Hamoaze on Friday to her sailing moorings off the Devonport dockyard.
			About S0 artiScers and others were discharged on Satur day from Devonport dockyard.
			The screw steamship Hero, 91, Capt. Seymour, at Devon- port, will be out of the hands of the shipwrlghts and joiners about the 6th of May.
			The transport Havering, Capt. Rickcaby,with Government stores, from London for Hongkong, put into Plymouth Sound on Friday, with the crew in a state of insubordina- tion In consequence of the alleged leaky condition of the forecastle. It became necessary to ceek maglsterlal inter- ference, and Capt. P.lekarby was ashore at Plymouth for that purpose on Saturday, when the weather, which has been extremely boisterous In the neighbourhood for some days past, increased to a gale, and the chains of the
			lavoring snapped in a most sudden and unexpected manner. She drifted towards Batten Bay, and her condition having been observed by the ships-of-war in the Sound several boats crews were sent down to her. SaU was in the meantime got up, and she had nearly cleared the bay when her stern unfortunately caught in the ridge of the Batten 4egdo of rocks, and there shoremained. A Government tug and the steamer Lord Yarborough werein attendance on Friday evening, but their assistance was of no avail. Yesterday she filled ; two barges were alongside receiving cargo, and a Government tug vas at hand. Messrs. Fox, Sons, and Co. are acting as agents. The Havering registers 006 tons, and belongs to Messrs. Livingstone, Toulmin, and Co., of Lon- don. Besides Government stores, which, it is said, in- clude some Armstrong guns, she has about 150 tons of general merchandize.
			The foUowing appointments were made on Saturday at tbe Admiralty :-Commander Edward Scott, to the Centurion; Liout. Charles B. S. Woodman, to the Centurion; jelut. George H. Barnard, to the Nile; Lieut. Charles �. Fegen additional, to the Ajax; J. Gill, acting third-class assist.- engineer, to the Asia, as supernumerary.

			VICTORIA CROSS GALLERY.
			This highly interesting gaUery wil be re-opened to the public to-day, Mr. Desanges having increased the collec- tion exhibited last year by the addition of a number of portraits, 3nd a large picture representing a striking inci- dent in the history of the Indian Mutiny.
			The exhibition may be considered a most remarkable tn- stance of Individunal perseveranee and enterprise. The pic- tures, about 40 In number, are all the work of Mxr Desanges, and several of them are on a large scale, rising to the dig- nity of historical composition. His plan has been as defi- nite as his exertions to earry it out have been unwearied. Entire battles he has not essayed to depiet, but he has con- fined himself to those episodes of war which the eye of a single observer is capable of apprehendlng, and with respeet to whleh accurate information Is attainable. The officers who have sat for their portraits have likewise described to the arttst the scenes in which theywereengaged, and further details have been furnished by their companions in arms. Every picture bears for its title the name of a hero on whom the Cross bas been bestowed, and, therefore, may be sup- posed to embody in some manner the story of his deserts. Thus the records of the Russian War and of the Indian Mutiny are biographically illustrated by a series of Works, boldly conceived, carefully executed, and-what is the most Important point-each clearly and forcibly telling the tale which belongs to it. In other countries such a collection would be the result of a Government order, but hero a single artist has originated and completedat hsi own riskan entire exhibition, illustrating two national epochs.
			The new pictures are mostly based on information brought to this country by officers of the Indian army after the sun- pression of the mutiny, and have all been painted within the ineredibly Ehort space of eight months. The smaller works consist of heads and of episodes treated within cabinet limits. Several studies of the larger pictures are also hung about the room, and bear testimony to the finish of the artist's execution, being, in point of fact, elaborate zr1oa - tures.
			The place of exhibition Is the ground floor of the ?02 fan-hall, Piecadilly.

			I BOYAL ITALIAN OPERA.
			Mr. Gye's prospectus, although offering no new polnts of verygreat importance, Is not merely attractlve, bnt, Indeed, in all respects satisfactory. The catalogue of lady sngers eomprl5esthree onfamlllar names-gademolsellesfRlapzini andGludita Silvla,of whos previousperformancesnothlng s recorded on Cis-alpine territory, and Madame (not Made- moiselle) Rosa Csillag, who, since the year 1853, has filled the hLghest post at the German Opera In Vlenns, and created a,marked impression list year In the grand scene from Der Ereischiltz at one of the Philharmonic Concerts- the only time she wras ever heard in London. This lady is to make her first appearance in fLeonora, in Fiudio, which has not been represented at the Royal ItalLan Opera einoe 1854, when Mademoiselle Sophie Cruvelli (now the Baoness Vigier) sustained the part of the herolne. Among the few possessed of the vocal and histrionIc capa- bilities indispensable to an effective portrayal of Beethoven's heroine, Mhadme Csillag, by general consent, takes a fore- most rank, her physiecal and mental gifts peculiarly fiting her for the task Another name on the list may also, In some measure, be regarded as a novelty. We allude to Madame Miolan Carvalho, who appeared at the dose of the season last year in Meyerbeer's Dinoraz, which WaS so successful that the talented 6ongstross from the Tha&amp;tre Lyrique had no opportunity of displaying her ability in any other work. This season, however, Madame Carvalho Is to add three characters to her repertory- Rosina in the Barblere, Amina In Le Sonnainbula, and Zerlina In Era D&amp;cvolo. That in Auber's Zerlina she will be just as much at home as in Dinorah there can be little doubt; but she has yet to prove her efficiency in parts appertaining to the pure Italian repertory, and especially of such importance as the Ward of Seville and the vllage Som- nambulist. What was recently said of another French artist, however, may be predicted with equal safety of Madame Carvalho, whose reputation is far too great, and founded on too solid a basis, to be lightly risLked; in addition to which her histrionio talent is sufa ficiently distinguished to place her quite on a level with her Italian rivals. Of late years, moreover, the disadvantage of not being an Italian has militated very lIttle against the successof any fresh aspirantto the honours of Italian opera-Germans, French, Spaniards English and even Russias, having saccessively disputed the palm with the most accomplished "natives." Addison used to ridicule those pastlecios ("galtimaufries" Dr. Barney caUed them) In which, while the airs were given in Italian the dialogue was held in the vernacular; and when Handel had established the opera In its " integrity," Introducing musi- cal recitative instead of spoken dialogue, so that the Italian language was exclusively employed, Addison, instead of being psclfied,delivered himself of a prosabi eoo mt, to this effect, -thatEngllshsxmateurs,tlredwitheunlynnderstaudinghatE the plieco, found it more convenient to understand none at all
			Iad he been living to witness the Italian opera of the last quarter of a century, the elegant essayist (who wrote the libretto of an eminently unsuscesEful opera) might have found a still more legitimate theme for the excercise of his opliramosatlo wit. While on the subject of new camera.
			and especially of non-Italians, we may at once name DC. Faure%another exportation from the Op6ra Oomiqne, and, Fren rnman thoungh he be, a most valuable acquisition to Mr. GyO's company. X Faure, the saccessor of M. Bataille as Peters in the Rtoilc dus Xford sad the original Hoel in the Pardon de Pl6ermel (DinoraU), is now, perbaps, the most accomplished singing-actor on the French stage, and if ho can employ his talent with tshe same facility elsewhere, Sn spite of t.he difficulties connected with the use of a foreign tongue, there can be no question about his success. M.Faulre Is to appear (with MIadame Iiolan Carvelbo) in Dinora,h on the first night of the season-Tuesday, April 10.
			To return to the ladies; at the head of the l1st iS the same honoured name which has made the London Italian Opera prospectus attractive year after year, almost un- interraptediy, for more than a quarter of a century, a name the absence of which would have been, time out of mind, regretted more than that of any other, and since the oppositi6n to Her Majesty's Theatre was first instituted at Covent-garden, thirteen years past, has been a tower of strength to the Royal Itallan Opera. Madame Grisi (our readers wll have anticipated nB) is engaged for twelve nights -" to appear in those parts which have chiefy contri- buted to her great popularity during her long and brilhiant
			career."
			With well-judged reticence-suggested probably by the
			remembrance of " 1854,'" when Madame Grisi bade " adieu " to her English patrons, only to come back in 185i, and delight them, unexpectedly, once more -the prospectus does not mention the fact that
			ohs tev nights"' ace to be truly sand in good
			faith, Grisi's " last ;" but as we have reasoa to believe that
			this is positively the case, we may, without impropriety, fill
			up the hiatus. If in 1861 the frequenters of the Royal Italian Opera are stiU to be edified with Norsma, Semiratmide, Lucrezia, &amp;c., it will not be with GilLa Grist as the Druid Priestess, the Assyrian Queen,
			or the haughty Messalina of the milddle ages-hut
			with Glula Grisi's successor, whoever that person may
			chance to be. So that, with all who appreciate at its worth
			the most remarkable genius the lyric stage has wit- nessed-Malibran herself not excepted-since Pasta was in her prime these " twelve nights" wiUl be re-
			moved from the ordinary routine of operatic entertain-
			moents-" twelve night." to witness with uncommon in- terest, and be remembered long afterwards. That Grist will put forth al her energles to impress the public with a
			belie that no absolute reason exists for her retiremnent from
			the scene of her triumphs, may be talken for granted. Thes, at one house the youngest, at the other tho oldest " prima donna" is to tread the boards, in the course of the present operatic season, " for the last time." To have done with the adies-hadame Penco, who won so many partisans last year, in the 2'rariata, the Puritaai, and especially in Don Giovanni (as Zerlina), and Madame 2Nantier Didice, the universaUy popular mezzo-soprano-contralto return to their posts. There are also Meadames Leva and Taglia6ico, "comprimarie" (second or third ladies, as the case may e), who have not succeeded, nor are 1ikedy to suc- ceed,in m akieng thei reCaquvehntierts of the opera forget

			Maral bas disappeared; aud, unless Mademoiselle Rappaz- zinl, or Mademoiselle Sylvia, is destined to reign in her stead, we shall have only lady-singers of the first and third ranks. with no intermedium.
			It is enough to enumerate the names of the tenors to show that in this particular department Mr. Gye is as strong as on any previous occasion. They are Signors Mario Gardoki, and Tamberlik, as "principals," Signers Ner Batraldi and Luclhes! (the voiceless "virtuoso") as "seconds." A mong the barytones and basses, besides hl. Fae, already named} we find most of the old favourltes-Slgnor Ronconl, to repiace whom would be about as difficult as to replace
			SigorMwthafari;SgnfotreGlroasitacni, wehio conise forward this timewitout earof te Lrd Cancllo; Signors Tagiafico and Polonini, two of the most zealous, generaUy serviceable and therefore indispensable members of the company; MI Zelger, the Belgian Formes; and one or two others to sig nae whom by name would be to make none of u the wiser.
			The fact that the orchestra and chorus, wlth Mr. Costa as chief, are to be the same to which the public bas been accustomed, may be stated without comment. The Royal Italian Opera owes too much to the efficiency of these very important auxiliaries to admit of their ever being diminished in strength while so prudent and energetic a director as Mr. Gye is at the head of affairs. Among the operas to which the management is pledged, besides sorne novelties and revi-
			hind)a Mandamhe MSiola7n-sCtairvailso is tco auataln the chief cha- racter; the Gazza Leadr-a, with Madame Penco as Ninetta, and M. Faure as Fernando (the great part of Tamburini, played last season by Signor Debassini); Aartha, with Madame Penco as Eenrietta (Madame Boslo's original cha- racter, moat recently entrusted to Madame Lotti) ;Fra rDarote, with Madame lifolan-Carvalho as Zerlinsa and lligofctto, with Madame Penco as Gilda. Further we learn that-
			"In order to etrengthen the caSts o f th opeas o! 'Don Giovannt, and ' Lea Huguenots,' Madernoieells Rosa CaUliag has kindly eonserted to slog the part of Evia In the fomere, and MsdAmeMlon-Caeraeo that of argsuerita de Valois in the latter,"'-
			an announcement the propriety of which maybe questionel, on the ground that in Germany (as Mlademoiselle Osillag must be well aware) the part of Dlonna Elvira Is always awarded to singers of the first rank, while that of Mar- pueribe de Valois-like Isabelle in Robert, and Berthe n the Prophete (as Maadame Carvalho will scarcely re- fuse to own)-has invariably been cast to artists of the highest eminence-such as Cinti Damoreau, Dorms Gras,
			Wc. We can therefore perceive neither " kindness" nor condescension on the part of singers, no matter what their status, who "c1n-ent" to undertake parts In which such comparfisons may be challenged and ouch honourwon or lest. The promised novelties are notow's Str-adl&amp;c (Stradella, Signor Mario], the prodoction of which is warranted by the favourable reception accorded to the same composer's Men-aha, and Le Rome di Giancta, an Italian version of ?d. Victor Mass6Os one-act operetta2, Les Noes ide Jeannette, in which Mladame Carvalho and Signor roncons are to aear. The revivals (stil more welcome) are Cimarosa's admitrable Zatrisionio S'cgrclo, with a very powerful cast, including, for the first time, Signor Ilonconi as the deaf Geronimo (one nf the most memorable Imper- sonations of Lablache) and Meyerbeer's PropUlte (Itademol- seJle Csillag as Fides, gignor Tamberlik as Jean of Leyden), the reprodluction of which masterpiece, after a lapse of five year, is likely to prove one of the moat brillat incidents of the seaon.
			'Besides the operatic performances four grand concerto are to take place, two morning and two evening, anLd one "1 at least," in the New Floral-hall. At the second cono6rt (in the theatre) Gluc'k's Orfeo is to he tried, which juxstinies a query as to wy, If performed at all, this often-threatened excerpt of the prre-Yozartean epoch should not be per- formed, as intended, on the stage-as an opera, in short, rather than as a concert ?

			THE LIOENSING SYSTEM.
			TO T1l ED1r'P OF TRE TI3[ES
			Slr,-This evening Mr. Ayrton will move as an amendment on Mr. Gladstone's Bill for the esta- blishment of lieensed wine-shops Il that it is not ex- pedient to increase the number of houses in which fermented and spirituous liquors are sold." As five-sixths of the houses in which wine and spirits are now retailed belong to members of the great brewing monopoly, Mr. Ayrton's amendxnentmeans, not only that this oppressive monopoly shall b3 maintained in full force, but that it shall be enormouslyincreased by annexing to it the exclusive privilege of retailing the light continental wines recently admitted into this country at a low rate of duty. It also means that the retail of these light wines should be intrusted to the hands of the very parties-the brewers-who are most directly interested in checking their con- sumption and in baffling Er. Gladstone's measures. I do not anticipate that Mr. Ayrton will succeed in his preposterous attempt; and I have strong hopes that his clients, in grasping so greedily snd nin- reasonably at a further monopoly, will be lik;ely to be deprived of that which they actually enjoy.
			The House of Commons does not approve of being dictated to by anv class; and the unscrupulous measures adopted by the great brewes and their servants on this occasion certainly assume the aspect of dictation. Their organs in the press have made known from day to day in no measured lan- guage the extraordinary exertions which they are making to extend their monopoly. A committee room has been hired in the neighbourhood of West- minster, where petitions are daily concocted by the score, and where members of Parliament are threat- ened, stimulated, and refreshed by influential constituent publicans as their cases may re- quire. Hundreds of ginshop-keepers have been publicly invited to line the lobbies of the House of Commons this evening, in order to show that they are in earnest, and to keep their repre- sentatives up to the mark, while a suitable array of the apostles of temperance, who have been per- suaded that the substitution of weak light wines for brandy and gin will be likely to demoralize the working classes will also attend, and will exhibit the startling spectacle of sobriety and delirium tremens contending side by side on behalf of the interests of ardent sDirits l
			The consequence of this ostentatious display of brute force will probably be that the whole system wiD be voted intolerable by every sensible and in- dependent man in the House, and that Mr. Glad- stone will be invited to abate the entire monopoly at once and for ever.
			It is almost impossible to exaggerate the unfair and oppressive conditions of the licensing law as it is at present administered. When a Board of ma- gistrates meets for licensing purposes some 10 or 20 applicants present themselves. To qualify them for application they must al be provided with suitable premises, properly fitted for the trade into which they eeek admission, although probably not more th,an one out of the 20 wiU succeed in ob- taining a licence. This condition is surely oppressive enough; but as soon as the applications have been made, and the testimonials as to character examined, the licensing magistrates ask whether there Is any opposition. Thus invited, every publican in the vici- nity of course opposes, having no mind to share his customers with interlopers, and declares that in his opinion there sre already far too many publichouses in the district. The Bench then takes into con- sideration what are called "the requirements of the neighbourhood ;" they calculate so many public- houses, so many inhabitants, and give their verdict -which in 49 cases out of o0 is unfavourable- accordingly.
			In vain the unhappy beer consumers complain that the existing publichouses al belong to a few confederated brewers; that the liquor they cal porter is "cabman's mixture" of the vilest class, while its price is the price of pure porter, and that the accommodation they afford is inferior and insufficient; the magistrates' stock reply is, "Into these trivial details we decline to enter. Our rule is, so many inhabitants so many publchouses, and we see no reason to deviate from it in your case. As we rarely drink beer ourselves, and get our wines wholesale from the wine mer- chant, we experience no inconvenience what- ever from this arrangement, which it is ab- surdly and vexatiously pretended presses heavily upon you of the lower middle and lower classes. It happens to be true that most of the pubEchouses hereabouts belong to two or three firms; but we aro all intimately acquainted with the members of those firms; we know them to be wealthy, virtuous, and influential men, and we are not going to diminish the value of their property by admitting obscure people to compete with tbem under pretence of obtaining for you cheaper and purer beer. You must he well aware that the less beer you drink the better for your health, your morals, and your families."
			Imagine, Sir, the tables turned, and the same kind of measure dealt out to the Lord Lieutenant of the county and his magistrates by a bench of
			Rrn.flcn hnor. A,rnl1a0 I
			Imagine the parish of St. George arbitrarily handed over to two old established wine merchants, having a vested interest in the supply of that rich district; the ihliabitants being told that they must either buy their port, sherry, champagne, and clarets of these two fortunate firms, or else drink water-a much less gouty and more wholesome beverage ! How rich those privileged winesellers would become; what town and country-houses they would have ; what pictures and S&amp;vres china they would collect ; what stepping horses they would ride and drive; what charities they w.ould promote ; and, above all, what execrable wine they would seUll
			I don't think that such a monopoly as that would last very long; I doubt if even Messrs. Ayrton and Edwin James could be prevailed upon to defend it; and yet it is precisely, muttatis nqdtandis, the Rind of monopoly which now so heavily presses upon the middle and lower classes of this country, and which those talented advocates will this evening urge the House of Commons to confirm and extend.
			I am, Sir. vour obedient servauL.

			The Atlantic Royal Mail Steam Navigation Com- pany's steamship Prince Albert sailed from Galway on Saturday for St. John's, Newfonndland, and New York, with Her Majesty's mails, 550 passengers, and a fair cargo.
			Tim FosrTHco,siixG PBiZI; FIIRT.-HERTFORD, Saturday.-This afteroon Colonel Archibald Etoberteen, chief constable of the Hertfordsblre police force, made ap- plication to the justices assembledl in petty session at Hert- ford for a warrant to apprehend Thomas Sayers, the cntChampion of England," and John Heenan, the American pugst, in order that they might he bound over to keep the peace. Colonel Robertson stated, as the ground of his ap- plication, that he had received information, upon which he could rely, that the fight announced between Sayers and Heenan was appointed to come off In the county of Hert- ford. If the assemblage upon the occasion were likely to ho an ordinary one the force at his command vwould be ample to prevent a breach of the peace, buxt he had reason to be- lieve that not less than 8,000 persons would acompany the pugilibs to the spot fixed upon for the encounter, and be therefore felt it was necessary to take the precaution of binding the parties over to keep the peace. The Bench said the matter was one of great importance, as there was no knowfing what miischief might be done by the irruption of 8,000 persons of the class likely to as- semble at a prize-fight into a quiet agricultural county. The warrant was at once granted, and signed by three magis- trates-Mr. T. Mills, M.P., the chairman of the bench, (who is also a magistrate for the liberty of St. Alban and the county of Middlesex), Lieutenant W. R. Baker, and Mr. G.

			MANAGERIAL ADDRESSES.
			The prn-paschal season having been brought to its tem[. nation on Saturday night, three sections of the publio wera almost simultaneously addressed by as mauny theatricai' managers in different parts of London.
			MAdame Celesta's leave-taking was more serious -than the, others. as she does not propose to reopen the Lyceum tIl the 1st of October. She reminded her aience that, al.
			though she had received her artistical education In Prinee- and " her tongue ws faithful to her matlve country," th
			pieces she had prued were by rEgUsh writers, the musil
			wa ude Bg 'duierection, the scenery was by an Eag1islsY
			painter, and the support she had received was "t truly a.. glish in its kindness and goodwill." Hitherto she hba beesi only a tenant at will, anadtherefore we are requested to lookI upon the past season as a " mere preface to a book not ylet commenced;" but on the 9irst o' October she will com.1 raenco a lease for a term of years, and then "1every page og( the book wil be as good as she can mak-e it."
			WVhle MadameoCeleste, at the Lyceum vas likening her seasons past and fature to a preface and abook, Mr.
			at the I.rlncess's indulged his audience with imagery of thc nautical kind. Eus good ship had been refhttea, re-maLnned, re-freighted, and taken Into the " speculative waters of the, Theatrical Ocean" by a somewhat young hand in manageril I navigation, and he alluded to font weatherthat had assailedll him at the commencement of his journey, merely to bcIng
			forward the pleasing fact that by dint of good sesmanship4 and a willing crew he had been able to make hl3 fr3t porh safely and securely with colours hying. Thessfgur tva statements were followed by the amnounrementthatMr,/ Phelps would appear at the Princess's on Easter Monday as Sir Pertinax M'Sycophant and go through a series of hif favourite parts.
			Shunning all Imagery, nautical, literary, or otherwlse Ur. P. B. Chatterton, of tho St. James's, dwelU with prid(
			on the singular fact that his season had lnsted six months a duration not accomplished at that theatre within the last 15' years. Pleased with his success, and overflowing with gratitude to his patrotns, he intends to re-open on EasterMen- day with a new urlesque by Mr. Leicester Bnckingham.

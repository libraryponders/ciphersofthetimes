			IRElArD.
			(FROM OUn OWIN- CO-IMESPON-DEN-T.)
			A)UBJAN, SATURD_ky MolLrWO; THE I5RISIE EXODUs.
			One Irish revival having died out another and SI older one has inade its reappearance in the public journals. In a word, the exodus of the population is again a standard topic of -wonderment, especially aa for a Iew past years wo have been continually hearing through many sources of the growth of Iish prcsDerity, and ef the improvement in the moral andasocial condition of the peasantry. There must, however, be a screw loose somewhere, other, wlse, how are the emigration statistics of the Regis- trar-General to be amnounted for, or why is it that the Nation and its kindred organs have assumed the despondingtone in which the former speaks of the hegira of 1860? In an articlOe headed "Flying," the Nation thus vents its grief:-
			"They are flying; throu"b Dnblin our flying people poer dailyin weepingcrowds. Eor years our streets havenot beheld such scenes as those of the past week, though, alas I
			the ebb of PopuLation has net vhoF cea-sed at any timo fos a quarter of a csntary. Long lines of w;ofal faces, atrcngol3 mocking the olyday attire in wvhich the poor creatures attire thervselves as they quit f or ever their fatherg? clay- caravans of vehicles, piled with the brisht red painte3 boxe. and trunks with owners' names uarked rndely on the fronts; aged women, with hair vwhite as the hoar of December; old men, bent and broken by 60 years of toil in furrow and trench; younu men who try tG look hopeful that the mother may weep the less; younf
			women, feeling all the more deeply, as women do, at rending the thousand silent ties that link them to home; while children, too young to know the cause ofE all the sor- row they see on every f:ace, are only delighted with the wonders of the great bigstrceetsthrough which they pans. ALway, away, away-and not willingly nor happily. 'i'hey are not anomadeorace. Itis nob an A&gt;rab community that has struck the tent-poles; they are not dull-hearted, plodding Saran people, who for a meal the moreinthe month would cross the globe itself, and cal it folly to feel less at home in Kamtschatka than in the land where their fathers' ashes for centuries repose. No, no; these area people whose very heart-strings are wrung by the idea of eternal exUo; a people who, slmost to a fault-if a virtue so beautiful could ever be a fault-cling to the ancmstral home; a people who, if they could but live-if they could but eat an humblo cru3t, broken amid the hardest toil-in Ireland, the land of their hearts' affections, would deem it sweeter than the bread of luxury in a foreign clime. Away, away, away ! Men thou-hb it had ceased, this ter- rible exodus; they thought this fearful hemorrhage had ceased to drain the lifeblood of our country. But here it is, full upon us again; the wails are rising once more in eeryvillage. Whole communities are quitting for over, in sorrow and despair, a land-or which they would freely die."
			GOVEY.NSEEYT PrATRoNAGE.
			There is no chance, it seem3, of the Mllastership in Chancery, at preseut held by Mlr. Acheson Lyle being left at the disposal of the Government unti the month of August, or perhaps later, when l\r. Lyle will be entitled to retire on his full salary~ 2,5001. a-year. M\r. Justice Perrin, wvho a very short time since gave up his seat in the Quleen's Bench, receives bult two-thirds of his former salary by wa;y of retiring allowance.
			THE fIish cnuncI.
			The deanery of Kilmore, vacated by the death e! Lord Fitzgerald and Vesey, has been conferred bT Lord Carlisle upon the Rev. Dr. Carson, rector of Cloon. His Excellency has nominated the Rev. Frederick Ftzpatriclc, son-in-law of the Marquis ot Headfert, to the valuable living of Cloon, vacant by the promotion of the Rev. Dr. Carson. His Excel- lency has also nominated the Rev. MIr. Broughanm to the living of Templeport, vacant by the promo- tion of the Rev. Frederick Fitzpatrick.
			EXTIAORDINARY FtATES OF FAIM PRODUCE.
			The prediction of high prices and scarcity of food for cattle, consequent upon the remarkable drought of the summer of 1859, is more than realized by the fact that in the present month of April the "market value of certain products of the field and farm is in some instances up to a point which far exceeds the rates paid in the days of the First Napoleon. The Northera Whig remarks:-
			" Butter is a ready sale at l-4s. the owt. for prime, being the highest price known for 40 years past; and pork sells at 57s. for top lots-a rate of value rarely reached. The most wonderfal of all quotations are, however. those of cabbage plants. Vast quantlties of these products are every even- ing sent over the Channel for the markets of the west of Scotland and the north of England. and the prices realized by growers nreremarksable. WVe have heard of onecasa where a dealer bought a plot of cabbageplantsgrodwinginthe corner of a field at 171., and ater wads sold thento a suecn- lator at50l. The 'crates' of plants to he seen on the quiys of Belfast awaiting shipment m the Glasgow steamers sell at from 101. to 151. each, and the wholesale prices have gone un
			from 3d. to Is. the 100, and in certain cases 2s. have been paid. The feverlsh excitement-as once the rage for tulps an Holland-is li-ely to he re-enacted for cabbage plants in the north of Ireland. Snch is the dearth of the supply that holders are fairly puzzled to know how much to demand fe2 the article. Then we have the famine in fodder. Tht owner of half a dozen stacks of upland hay is at preseni finding himself In possession of a small California, and gold passes into his treasury with a rapidity hardly exceeded In the days of San Francisco. Market prices this week art from 6s. to 6s. 9d. the cawt. for first-class upland, and 4s. tc 5s. 6d. for low ineadowhay. In some parts of Ulster, whert unusual scarcity prevails, 8s. has been paid for prime rye. grass hay, and eaten straw calls at 4g. to 6s. the cwt. These prices hove never before been approached in this country, and yet rarely have cattle been in batter condition than they are at present. In the cattle falr, held on Wednes- day, there were some of the finest dairy cows ever seen in Belfast, and at no former period was that varlety of stock n condition superior to that of the majority on sale. This
			is rasner exrraorainary, considering the uneqnailed prices of fodder. Farmers have been trying the experiment of keep. iug stock to a great extent on roots, or, at least, reducing the quantity of hay and straw two-thirds, and makhng up the difference in other varieties of food, and the result hNas been most successful. Not only have the cattle been well kept up aU the season, but the general appearance of sitook is much better than it vas at the end of last spring. P'rlces of dairy cattle of mark and promise are at the extreme point of quotations, and, as in most other departments of farm produce, sales are pretty easily effected."
			The .Northern H&gt;Yiig, the leading commercial journal in Belfast, has the following remarks upon the proposed abolition of the privilege of re-trans- mission of newspapers through the Post-office -
			" It seems to be finaUy determined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, while the impressed stamp on news- papers is still to be continued, the privilege of repeated re- transmission of the paper bearing that stamp is to be finally withdrawn. The whole amoant of benefit which Is de- rivable by any party from the use of the impressed stamp lies in the greater despatch with which papers may be sent by post than by affixing stamps to them in the hurry of business. This convenience will, no doubt, be felt so far in newspaper offices, and occasionaly also by private parties, who may not at all times and seasons, wheni they desire to- despatch a paper, have such a thing as a Queen's-head about them. But the withdrawal of the old privileges of the im- pressed stamp is really shabby. When the stamp wmas com- pulsory, and had to be paid by the man who lived next doEr to the newsmonger as well as by the man who lived at the other end of the island, it at least served a number oi readers, and gave the newspapers a wide gencral circulation through the country. Those who advocated the abolition of the compulsory stamp, and succeeded in getting it done away with, knowing that to give a dog a bad name is a very excellent way of getting him knocked on the head, called thecompnlsoryimpressedastampa'taxonkknowledge. Now, there was a timewben there was anewspaper impreeaedstamp of fourpence, which might truly be called a 'tax on knowl ledge,' and public-spirited men ross up and denonnced it in the mcst vehement language, as cruel and oppresEive,whichit really was. That tax hns almost passed from the recollection of the present generation. WThen, somefew years ago, the agi. tatiouwvas raisedsg,ainsttheexistenceof thc com pnlsorypenn5 stamp, with all its advantages of repeated transmissions, the denmumcers of it borrowed the baa name which had long before been bestowed on the fourpenny step, and qaoted against the moderate penny all the indignant censure which patriots had long before bestowed on the opprcesive four- pen=c. Whether the promoters of the abolition of the com- pulsory stamp wvere slncere in their expressed desiro to benefit the readers and publishers of newspapers, or, as there is reason to believe, were more anxious to make an alteration in the general character of the newspaper press, by extending the circulation of newspapers in the towns in which they are published, and contracting that circulation in those places which the papers can only reach by means of the stamp which carries them through the pest-office, is not worth arguing now. It is sufficient that the Act which came into operation in the middle of 1855 left the use of the impressed stamp with aUl its privileges untouched. Now that the stamp impressed is to carry no advantage whatever above the Queen's-head affixed, It is not to be wondered at that there are many people who regret the change, and wounld, as far as their own particular interests and con. venience are concerned, prefer a return to the compulsory stamp, with its advantages."

			MORNEY-MARKET and OITYISTELLIGENOB.
			SATMWAY EVENTIYG.
			The English funds opened this norning at a decline of an eighth, and subsequently experienced a further reducaion. The fi.st bargains in Consols for money were at 943 to -, and the last at 94.~ to :. For the 9th of Ma'y the concluding price was 941 to '. This was first transfer day in the New Three per Cents., and quotations were partly influenced by a few sales of that stock. The Bank return, however, was the chief cause of the depression, although its totals Ehow conclusively that the un- precedented pressure of the revenue collections this quarter, coupled with the recent advance in the Bank rate of discount, has led the public to appre- hendinconvenience, and to fortify themselves with amounts of notes and specie wholly beyond their regular wants. The market was not affected by any foreign news, but the quotations from the Paris Bourse showed flatness. Bank Stock closed at 225 to 226( ; Reduced and New Three per Cents., 927 to 933 ex dividend; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bils, lOs. to 13s. premium.
			The Rupee Stocks were without alteration, and closed respectively at 98 to i and 104.
			The demand for money to-day has been less active, although still on a considerable scale.
			In the foreign stock -market there has been a slight deline in the Turkish Six per Cent. Loan of 1854, the final quotation being 79 to i. The new stock Improved in the morning, but closed the Eame as on Thursday, at 61H to 62. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 90�; Buenos Ayres Deferred, 24k; Grenada Deferred, 4- ; Mexican, for the account, 22- and 22; RussianThree per Cents., 64j; Spanish Passive, 14i; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 79!; Tew kioan, for the account, 62-, G61, 621, and 61 E; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 101.
			The final price from Paris this evening was 69f. 65c., showing a decline of i per cent.
			-vgulu was, eaKen trom tjie biank to-day.
			Although the negotiation for 2,650,0001. additional Victoria Six per Cent. Debentures is to take place on Wednesday, the price of the existing issue is steadily smaintained at 107 to -. Mlany persons doubt, how- ever, if the mninianum will be found sufficiently low to result in the subscription of the entire amount.
			The French concession for railways in Algeria is stated to embrace a capital of 2,320,0001., wvith a 5 per eent. guarantee for 09 years. Subscription Este for a portion will probably be opened in London.
			According to the New York advices to-day, money had again become more abundant. 'ne rates of exchange were steady, and the prospect of specie re- mnittances to this country will be increased by our present high terms of discount. The imports lately had been large, but it was thought many of the fner descriptions of goods would leave a loss. The extreme prosperity of the Southern States, owing to their enormous cotton profits, is likely to lead, how- ever, to a continuous consumption of all articles of lumury. In Missouri new elements of future repu- diation seem to have been introduced. The State legislature ha3 just authorized a fresh issue of lbonds, to the amount of nearly a million sterling, in aid of railway work,, and some of the members who voted in the minority are already denouncing the transaction as forced and dishonourable, and warn- ing their friends that the Missourian people will take an early opportunity of refusing to pay taxes to meet these obligations.
			iThe Act imposing new stamp duties came into operation on Thursday morning, but, owing to offi- eial mismanagement, the London merchants and bankers wvere unable to obtain copies of It until late in the afternoon. An estraordinary amonnt of in- convenience was, therefore, inflicted. Henceforth not only al cheeks drawn upon bank-ers must be stamped, but also every letter to a banker directing payments to be made or money to be forwarded must have affixed to it an adhesive penny stamp (not a postage stamp), which stamp must be can- celled by the writer with his name or initials and the date on which the stamp is used. A penalty of 201. is attached to the non-observance of these direc- tions.
			The railway proceedings of the week have been of little importance. At the Portsmouth meeting It was stated that the two largest outstanding claims have been adjusted, and that considerable progress has been made in the other matters relating to a final winding-up of the company. The Glas- gow, Dumbarton, and Helensburgh have de- rilared a dividend for the past six months at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, making a total of 4i for the year. The traffic amounted to 13,6141.., showing an increase of 1,4J01. The report of the Redditch states that the line was opened last September, and that there are hopes of a speedy dividend. A work- Sig arrangement has been concluded with the Eid- land. The shareholders of the Londonderry and Enniskillen have approved a lease of the under- taking to the Dundalk and Enniskillen. The rent is to he 26,0001. for three years, and then to be in- creased by 20 per cent. on thegross receipts exceeding 95,0001. per annum until it reaches a maximum of 33,0001. The Dnhlin and Kingstown have agreed
			to divide at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum out of the available balance of 15,5601. No dividend was proposed by tbe Dtinblane, Doune, and Callander, the directors being of opinion that one annual dis- tribution alone should be made. The receipts for the past half-year have increased 7101., and the ex- penditure about 6001. The General Terminus have determined on a dividend at the rate of 21 per cent. per annum. It was stated that the coal traffic, owIng to an alleged inequitable system of charges by the Caledonian, shows a considerable falling off. The report of the Portpatrick states that the contract for the portion of the railway between Stranraer and Portpatrick has been let, thus completing the contracts for the whole of the main line to Castle Douglas. The weather during the winter has considerably impeded the pro- gress of the works, but operations have nevertheless been vigorously carried on. The lease of the Dublin and Kingstown to the Dublin and Wicklow has been approved at a meeting of the latter company. The proposed distribution of the Great North of Scotland at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum has been agreed to. The passengers in the half-year ending inJantary swere 271,653, against 204,658 in the same period of 1868-9. The goodstrafficalsoexhibitsanincreaso. The Perth and Dunkeld have declared a dividend at the rate of 2 per cent.; Arbroath and Forfar, 5 ; and Crieff Junction, 41. Numerous Wharnceliffe meet- ings have been held in the course of the week to consider Bills before Parliament for various railway purposes. At the half-yearly meeting of the Great Western of Canada it was determined to appoint a committee of investigation. The directors having misunderstood an offer from the Canadian Govern- ment with regard to the interest on their loan, a correction was made in the accounts, by which tho available balance -was reduced from 41,3111. to 23,8131. The proposed dividend at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum, was consequently not declared. The distribution of the Western and North-Western of France for the second half of 1859 was 20f. a share, making a total for the year of 37f. 50c., being 4f. 50c. more than in 1858. The receipts were stated to show a marked improvement. At the Paris and Orleans meeting a dividend of 67f. was approved, makiing a total return to the shareholders for,1859of97f. Thegrossrevenuefortheyearwas 2,941,6791.,and the expenditure 1,628,8061.

			RAILWAY INTELLSaBGBOB.
			PEEBLES.
			t-ile report of tbo directors states that the revenue account for the half-year ending the 29th of February lost shows a balance of net profits, after defraying woridrin expenses, parish rater, and Government duty, of 2,9031. This was an incerease on the corresponding half of the preceding year of 555!. The available balance for interest and dividend amounted to 2,9551., from which was deducted 7251. for into- teat on debentures, 6151. the dividend on the 5 per cent. preference shares, and It was proposed to deduct 1,5812. for a dividend on the ordinary shares at the rate of 4A ner cent. per annum, leaving 531. to be added to the rese&amp;i~e fund, which would then amount to 1,164. after all the divi- dends were paid,. The workirg expenses amounted to 45 per cent, nearly, showing n saaing of 54 per cent, as coin- pared with these of the correspondinLg half-year, which amounted to 504 per cent. The capita account had been increased by the payment for three cottages at Leadburn, erected at a cost of 2351., for the company's servants. As; rent was charged for the cottages, they would not add any additional burden to the company. The sum of 8831. had been paidl for the new carriages bought In 1859. The ques- tion of amalgamation with the North' British Railway Coem
			p an ould be ful-ly considered at a specia meeting to be held .immediately after the ordinary meeting on the 14th inst. The North British Railway Company had increasedl the t-erms offered on their part to a preferential dividend of 41 per cent, on the ordinary stock,; the original terms were 31. per cent, per annum for three years, and thereafter 4 per cent. perannumain perpetuity. Thenamended terms ob- tained from the North British Company were conceded by the directors of the latter upon the assumption that a nearly unanimous assent on the part of the Peebles shareholders would thus he secured. The North British directors ad- mitted the weight to be attached to the increasing receipts fromi traffic on the Peebles Railway, and on this ground alone they had justified to their own shareholders the alug- mented rate of guaranteedI dividend. The only point for consideration was whether the terms offered were in amount equal to the fair value of the Feebler RailwaY in other words, whether any well-founded probability existed that the railway, as an independent company,would pay a higher dividend year after year than 41 per cent. on the ordinary stoclk. Thte directors accordingly (Mr. WV. Chambers, a director, dissenting) earnestly recommende-d to the share- holders the amalgamation Bill as it now stood for their ap-
			revel. The capital ncmtsoe ht1 5it
			Eee reeivd, nd127,5981. expended, leaving a balance of 3,083Z. against the company. The revenue aceount showedl that 5,6i01. had been received during the half-year ending the 29th of February, and 2,7071. expended, leaving a balance- of 2,0031.

			NEW BRNSWIOEK AND CANADA.
			iTe supplementaireport of the directors states that the English contractors having failed to fulfil the terms of their own proposal, which had been accepted by the company prior to the 31stof January last, the directors had now con- cluded an arrangement with contractors In Canada for the completion of the railway, and for meeting the liabilities of the company by an issoe of mortgage debentutres. The sum of 60,0001. was requisite independont of the cost of the works in New Brunswick, plant, ac., for materials to be shlpped, and for general expenses and outstanding liabilities. The debentures could not be tendered In payment unless pro- vision was made for na liabilities, and for the entire com- pletion of the undertaking; and the terms settled by the directors were as foUows:-
			" Ts debentures are to hear 6per cent, tobe iussed fornot lee than ive Yers. and the mon.y value of the contract is estimated at 80 per cent. on tho nominal amosmt of the debentures. The contractora take tho power of fadIng tho whole amount newssary to pay the �X00D0 upon debentures, and they are bomad to pay doen �15.000. part of the
			e0,000, within three weeks of the arrival at S t. Andreso of the oom- pany's agent; but they reserve the powerof requirnngd�45.000to befonnd by thodirectors, upon notice from them to that effecl. They also engags to take debentures in pay,nmt of allworksneresoryforcompleutg the
			ino to Woodotoc-k, and of all mato,ials, except the iron. Tho oon- tactora take a few days' option of dnding the iron, and in default of their doing eo, the company will provide it, rmaking the payment in debantaurs. The directors have enga ed to fnad the,t5,000, onre- coiving the debentures duo to the oontraetors in respect of that amount. But as tbeee debenturcs. under the contract, are valued at 20 per cent. disootnt, though bearina 6 per cent. for five years, the diretors will plane them at the disposal of the shareholders, and giva oach shareholder the option of takin them, and will only themselves retain them in the event of their not beinag taken up by the share holders."
			The debrntnrps were first debentures, limited, in no case to exceed 200,0001., and the amounts which would have totbe Issned to the contraetors under the contract. vouched by the company's engineer, as to future works to Woodstock, and actually asrertained, as regarded existing liabiities, were for works, stations, iron, ir., for permanent way (in- cluding discorunt), 83,8001.; general liabilities, plant, &amp;cc. (including discount), 63,400I.-total, 172,2001. The contract provided for the construction of the line and works, including stations, to the Woodstock terminus. There wero to be executed to the approval of the company's engineer, andin every respect completed reedy for traffic on or before the lst day of September next, ther tey sionr- iug the guarantee of a minimad profit of 4,8001. per annum For 25 years, and the ftheher grants of land promised ay the New Branswick Government, but contingent on the com- pletion of the railway by the period statedL The con- tract f.urther included an arrangement for the con- struction, by the same parties, of an extendson of the railway to the Canada frontier so as to effect a Unection with the Grand Trunk Ralpway of Canada. The colt of this extension, including permanent wayoand the noeesary station accommodation, woulid he a net sum of 4,GD01. per mile in cash, or 5,000o. in the debentures of the company, The total cost of the line from St. Andrew's to the Wfoudetonk terminus, when the present contract was completed, would he about 510,0001,, or a little over 5,6001. a mile. On this cost, a traffic of l01. per mile per week would yield-after deducting 50 per cent, for working ex;- penses, and paying the interest on thes debentures and the divIdend on the preference stock-S per cent, on the ordi- nary stock; and, as the traffic Increased to 151. per mile per week, that dividend would be raised to nearly 8 per cent.

			STATB OF TRADB.
			BIR=GaAM, APIL 7.-The trade of this to,nc on- tinues inactive although no indications of positive deprez- Sion are visible; Indeed the manufeatorlers were all of them in work fu l time up to Thursday night, but orders vrero very closely worked up in a great number of the mlnor trades. Easter holydays wil in all probability ba a day or two longer than usual. A lull in trade here is almost in- variable at this senson, when mamy of the factors' travel. lers are at home and country shopkeepers delay making up stocks; but the prospects of the home trade are believed to be good, and none of the principal manufacturers here have been making goods for the aug. mentatlon of their own stocks. The gammakers are steadily engaged upon the War-office contracts. The tube- m.akers, edge-tool menufacturers, and hollow/ ware makers, are pretty busy. Notwithstanding the quiet which prevails the number of artlsans out of employment is so sihall as not to bo wrorth consideration, and unskilled labour is not in a msuch worse poe'tion. In the adjoinine manufacoturing dis- trict of South Staffordshire and E:ast Worcestershtre there is tolerably feUl employment in all the principal branches. Messrs. Elkington and Co., electro-phters of this town have just completed a magnificent serve oi plate (dinner and dessert), in solid silver, for the Romish Bishop of M?uricastro. The gross weight is 16,000oz., and the cost 12,0001. The Birmingham small arms trade are about to submit for trial, before a committee appointed by the Government, a number of small bore military rifles.
			BRADFORD, 7nt.-The transactions in wools this week have been on a very small scale. The prices of lustre wools, however, remnin firm, but other descriptions are, if any- thing, easier to purchase. There is still a steady demand for noils and shorts at the rates previously current. In worsted yarns less than the usual amount of business has been done, both In the home and foreign branches of the trade. There is only a limited demand for 30's weft suitable for export, merchants desiring to operate on easier tarms than they can do at present; at the same time the prices required by the spinners are barely sufficient to cover the cost of production. Rates generally in this department do not exhibit any change worthy of nets. The coarse num- bers of cotton yrrns continue very buoyant and scarce, and the same remark applles to the better qualities of single yarns. hut the mnedium and flue numnbers of double are very quiet. On the wghole the sales of these yarns on ou r lest markt-daywerevery trifling in extent, utnotwithstand- ing this prices were well sustained. In the market for pieces slackness has prevailed during the week, and we have not much new business to report nor any alteration in quotations. The diminlshed activity Is partly owing to the present period being between the seasons, and partly to the fact that foreign buyers prefer to wait for the results of the approaching Leipric fair before entering into further en- gagements. The factory operatives in thin district continue
			in good employment.|
			DUB3LTN, 6TIL-The dalness noticed in onr last has been much more observable this week-, and aUl brauches of businessaremore or less affected. However,animprove- ment is speedily expected, as there is great soundness in general trade. The payments on the 4th have been pretty generaly well met. In Dublin there has been great punc- tua'aty, and the demand for money has since moderated.
			HUDDERSFIELD, 7T}L-There has been a paucity of woollen buyers here this week, and they have bought but sparingly, so that business both in the markets and at the warehouses has been rather flat. The best qualities of trouserings, both plain and fancies, continue in fair request, and orders for them continue to be received, so that the makers are weeU employed. The cold weather of the past month has doubtless checked the home trade, but a better state of things is likely to ensne soon. There is a llttle more doing in the export trade, and several large parcels of unions and other cheap fabrics for transmission abroad have been sold this week. Wool is very firm in price, and the local brokers are doing a fair business. The manufacturers in tho surrounding district are in full work.
			LEICESTER, 7Ter-There has hardly been so much doin- this week in the hosiery trade, the unseasonable wea- ther havlng operated prejudicially in the demand for spring goods. The polltical aspect of the Continent is also detri- mental to the demand. However, upon the whole, includ- ing the country districts, the market maintains a healthy tone and future prospects are flattering. In yarns there is no change. Wools are also unaltered in value, superior de- scriptions realizing high prices.
			NEWCA STLB-*O-TYNE, 7TIr-The general trade of the northern district, though the spring has now fairly opened out, is not so brisk as it was anticipated it would have been from the inquiries sent from the Continent two months ago. The iron trade is duU, and the other branches of industry sympathize with it. We have had large arrivals of vessels from Norway and the north of Europe this week; several United States' vessels are loading In tho docks and hbrbours; and'the movements of shipping generally on our coast have been more considerable than for some time past. The Tyne Custom-housa offlicers have cleared 155 vessels from oversea this week; 180 vessels have also been cleared at our Cnstom-house since this day week for oversee; a very large proportion of which have general cargoes for the Baltia - 214 vessels, with 46,714 tons of coal, have cleared from the Tyno since this day week for London and coastaise. The local frelght- market has kept steady during the feek. There Is an active demand for vessels in the North American timber trade, and the rate of freights has slightly advanced. Mdediterranean freights continue firm,; but outward freights to India have slightly receded. Adeputation of earthenware manufacturoers and Fre-brik and fre-clay gas-retort makers belongng to the Tyne are abount to proceed to Paris to have en interviewb with the Government with regard to the pro- posed French tariff on those articles ofE3nglish manufacture. At present about l,000,000 fire-brIcks are shipped amunually In the Tyne for Franco at a dety of 7 per cent. This duty it is proposed by the French Government to advance to S0 per cent., which wil amount to a prohibition. At the pro- sent time fire-clay gas-retorts are scheduled by the French Government among musical instruments, and are chsrged a duty equal to 90 per cent., wehich amounts to a prohibition. It seems that by the newv tariff earthenwere will bce charged by weight, the common brown earthenware manuFactured In this district being taxed at the same rate by weight as the mere costly article of manufacture sent from the Stafford- shire district. The coal trade with France remains dull and no alteration is expected until the treaty comes into operation.
			NORWICH, 7T'r.-Prospects in this city continue satis- factory, both as regards tho shoe trade and the general manu- faoturing business of the place. For the last three months there hsas been a gradualimprovement in the demand for labour, although the amount expended in the relief of pauperism ts still slightlyin excess of the corresponding period of 1859. Official returns prepared during the past week exhibit an excess of 2 per cent, as compared with 1859, hut there has been a kelative improvement of 4 per cent. since December.
			NOTTaNGHAM, 7Tr.-The lace trade remains as quiet sa for somo time past. The home demand will increase if the present fine weather continue, and should the fashions take a favourable turn much more wil ba done. The cotton lace trade is without any new featuro, and the demand for sUk goods is as duU as for some months past. Mdany of the workpeople are only partially engaged, manufacturers hold. ing off as far as practicable from creating stock. At prsent the wrehouses are not overburdened with goods. IL the home department of the hosiery trade there has been but little doing this week. The wholesale houses are acting with more than usual caution, and seem more disposed to cancel orders than to increase stock ; whether from the un- settled state of affairs generally, or from an impression that yarns will be lower, it Is having a sensible effect upon the trade. In the shipping trade there are a few buyers In the market, but their orders have not been by any means large. The impresslon is that the American fall trade wiIi be lato, and not an average one, they having had a cold season, the spring trade eetting in late, and the Presidential year is generally the worst year for business. Consequently, no great amount of businessis expested from that quar.er.
			SHEFFIELD, 7TEL-There Is a complete falling off iu the demand for crinoline steel-a somewhat singular circum- stance, as the summer season, when It is most used, Is just approaching. Crinoline is thought by some to be partiaDy going out of fashion, but the chief cause of the cessation of orders is that the markets, especially that of America, have been greatly overstocked. The demand for sted wire for ropes improves. In all the heavy branches the steel trade continues extremely active. The quantity of raw material sent out of the town during the past winter, and especially during the last month, is stated to be unprecedented, and there is as yet no falling, off of orders. It is notewoithy that the trade in raw material has for some time been on the incresse, while our staple manufactures have been comparatively iangnish- in-. Several houses arc sending considerable quanties of steel to France and other parts of the Continent, the soft tough steel, used for rifes and guns being largey in demand for those markets. German orders of a mode rately satisfactory amount have come to hand, and 3 fair trade with that country is anMi pated if political complica- tions are avoided. The American orders for cutlerycon- tinue to be unusuaUy small, considering the advanced period of the season, and the cutlery trade generally-cape. cialUy that of spring cutlery-is comparatively languid. Theeseals-eutters,a a consequece, are verye lck. The machine and tool trade-a comparatively recent one Shere-continues to develops isticf in a very satisfactory man ner. Aot present the makers are aUl decidedly basy. Reports as to the state of trade at Rotherham continue to be favou- able; but some difficalty with the grinders in the stove grate trade is unfortunately apprehended, in consequence, ns is alleged, of an attempt to extend the in'dnence os the Sheffield union to that district. The following figures as to the export of unwroaght steel Ilusrate the increase of our trade in the raw materialk:-Febrarsy, 1S58, 2,564C., Feb. rnary, 1859, 52,392t.; February, lS60, 76,497e.
			VOLVEsitttelTONw 7pris-The quarterly meetings of the Iron trade wigL be held next week, commencing hero on Wednesday. So far as present appearances Indicate the demardis likelyto be qetand prices rather bweak. As yet the sales of pig Iron, ore, &amp;c., for next quarter have not been of large amonmt, the leaog makers being anwilting to submit to the lowier p rices at which buyers expect to purchase, In the general hardware trades of this town and district there appears by a.U accounts sto be a sUiht falling off in the orders. This applies less to the home demand than to orders for export. The advices received here by the Aus- trallan mall confirm previous uccounts. The market was overstocked by goods sent out on consignment, and scarcely any orders wre to hand. There are, however, more remit. tances than by the last few malls.

			SHORT AEASURE IN BEER.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Permit me most emnphatically to deny the stte- ment of "Paterfamflias," In your impression of to-day, that it is a general practico of browers to sapply famiUes in casks holding less than their proper quantity, and also hiS
			brewer's "candid admission" that the coopers always mako small casks short meare, as, from my experience of 40 years with the brewers' coopers of London, I am quito cer- tain there are not any of them who would lend themselves to such a dishonest transactlon.
			I therefore conclude that " Paterfamilles' " brewer must have a cooperage of his own to carry out so gross a fraud, and moee sincerely wish he were located In this parish, where he would be subject to perlodical visits from the In- spectors of measures and his cheat exposod.
			I m. Sir. &amp;a..

			TO THE EDITOR OF TIHR TIEES.
			Shr,-In Thc Times of yesterday we observe a letter signed " PaterEamilias," charging the brewers aDd cooper$ with conspiracy to defrauld the pulblic by sending out casks deficient in measulre. We beg to state most distinctly that itis utterly cntrue. Out of some thousands of cssks we have only found one short of measure, and, although it wns only half-a-pint, it was sent hack to the cooper for altera- tion. Brewers' casks bold rather over, not under, the quantity.
			We recommend "Paterfamills" to change hIs brewer.
			We trst to the usual fairness of 77ic Times to aUow us to contradict a false statement, and remain
			Yours obediently,.
			A BBREW.

			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-In your impression of this day an artlclo aiDea
			headed " Short Measure in Beer" 1 and, as it is possibe for the public to be very much mislod by so broad an assertion, I feel it my daty at onceo to contradlct it. I have been a master cooper for 18 years, and supply brewers generaUy with about 30,000 casks annually, and in no instance have I known a brewer desirous of having his casks short in mea- sure ; on the contrary, my instructions havo always been to makethem full measure. To Esch an ertent Is tho precau- tion carred by many London brewers that their orders are for butts to be six qnarts over the imperial measure, and other casks downward in the same llbc.al proportion. If " PsterfarailiW vilU take the trouble to caU at my coonerage hne viIl there see the precautions taken to insure fullmeasur in brewers' caEks. Iam not in the habit of replying to aszertlons of " Paterfamilias," but his remarks are so far from the truth that I must beg a -ontradiction in your valuablo paper.
			I am. Sir. vours faithFullv.

			LONDON, MON0lDAY, APRIL 9, 186
			Switzerland continues in the state of disquietude into which she has been throvn by the sudden appearance of an army of 600,000 men upon her frontier. This is her real position. The whole force of the French Empire is, by tho occupa- tion of Upper Savoy, brought not only to the frontier, but to the open and unprotected frontier, of Switzerland. This alarm will scarcely be alleo viatea by the Emperor N-uoaao-;'s generous
			promise to protect the interests of Chablais and Faucigny, by establishing a " Commercial Zone," and the whole matter is so distinct from the annexation of Nice or of the French elopes of the Alps, that the Continental Powers have very wisely reserved it for separate discussion. The Savoy question has terminated just as we have always said it would terminate, but not without a certain quantity of undignified and ineffectual bluster, which we vainly attempted to disauade; the SwiSS question, however, still remains. Pro- fessor DE LA RIVE has come to London to force it upon our Cabinet, circulars are going forth to the Great Powers, and those study Switzers, with a consequence which makes us at once admire and smile, are drawing the troops of the Republic down to Ceneva. It is time for us to consider what par- ticulr interest this country has in the next matter which will occupy the attention of Europe, either in its separate Governments or in Congress.
			Among the papers recently laid upon the table of 'S-e House of Commons by Lord Joinz Russmr
			wa 9id: a paper with the title of "2!Ierlwirc rur les
			ca&gt;po. t3s entre la Suisse et la Sarwie .'Th'ntralisge." :- -.inphlet, of 22 folio pageF a&amp;ry lse- ful x our present purpose. i es the relations of Savoy and i Svitzerlah.l from the time of the wars of CHAR.zS the BOLD of Burgundy in the 15th century to the Treaty of Turin signed on the 16th of March, 1816. It shows that so early as 1564 it was stipulated between Berne and Savoy that " neither party "should alienate, by sale, exchange, or otherwise, cc any of their lands, townS, or fortresses to any "'other Prince or State." It traces this mutual obligation between Switzerland and Savoy through all their history, broken only by the dominion of the French during the perlod intervening be- tween 1792 and 1814 it quotes the solemn
			act of the Great Powers in 1815, their public expression of obligation to the Swiss, their authentic recognition that "the neutrality and "inviolability of Switzerland, and its independ- "oence of aU foreign influence, are the real "interest and the public pohcy of aU Europe ;" and it quotes the 23d article of the Treaty of Turin, which confirms the old engagement that Switzerland should not alienate the Pays du Vaud, and that Savoy should never alienate Chablais, Faucigny, and Geneva. Nothing can be more clear and convincing than this historical exposition. Sardinia is bound, by every engage- ment which ought to bind her, not to alienate the neutralized portions of Savoy; France is bound to respect the neutrality of these provinces; aud the Powers of Europe which assembled in Parliament at Vienna in 1815, and there made public laws, are in their public and aggregate character bound to make those laws respected. Theoreticaly and historically nothing can be more plain; but, prac- tically, infractions of this public law have been followed only by disregarded protests, and Europe has never confedlerated to punish a powerful offender. When Switzerland caUs upon Europe to enforce the public law of Europe there is no answer to be given except that it has not been the custom so to do.
			Every one can comprehend the anxiety felt by Switzerland that her neutral character shall not be drawn into doubt, and that her very moderate resources for making that neutrality respected shaU not be impaired. Her little territory is a great natural fortress, which any belligerent in that part of Europe would make haste to seize upon. From the heights of Switzerland France could at any time threaten Austria, Germany, and Italy, and occupy three great armies to watch and avert her uncertair blow. From those same elevations, if in the possession of the united Powers of Ger- many, the rich plains of Italy and France would offer themselves as a choice of prey, and we know that from that direction Paris has several times been threatened, and has once been reached. In case of European war, therefore, the first rush would be to occupy Switzerland. Switzer- land, consequently, feels that if she is not by universal law inviolable to all attacks, her fate must be to pass alternately from master to master, as the general fortunes of a war shall incline. The traditions of her valeys are still rife with the events of 1799, when bombsheUs fell in the streets of Zurich, when great Austrian and French armies were fighting upon their mountain sides, when foreign columns were seeking or eluding each other along the chamois-hunter's paths, and were meeting and struggling on their slippery
			glaciers. it is not torgotten, moreover, what fol- lowed when BoNAPART1 at last gained the mastery, and how the Switzers suffered and revolted, and were quelled and crushed. They have found it unpleasant to be made the cockpit into which, when the mood shall seize them, France and Germany come down to fight. It is true that this neutrality wil never be of a very sacred and binding character when there is a belligerent Power whose strength is so overwhelm- ing as to be able to forec it with impunity. In 1815 the allies took possession of the country with as little remorse as NAroLEoN had previously done, taLing care to make a solemn declaration of the reasons which rendered this violation of all ordinary obligations necessary. Such reasons will never be wanting when the power is present to give effect to them, and therefore it is of the first Importance that Switzerland as a neutral Power should have a strong frontier, and should be enabled to make the violation of its territory a work of difficulty as well as an act of illegality. Now that Switzerland lies open to France, and the Lake of Geneva is a French lake,-which it is if Chablais be now part of France,-the neu- trality of Switzerland is gone. Whenever France goes to war with Germany, Switzerland will be- come a great salient bastion projecting into the country which France is desirous to attack.
			This seems to be an important consideration to Austria-even, perhaps, more important than her particul1ar dissatisfaction with Sardinia ought to allow her to pass by. Bavaria and Wurtemberg -may also Eee in it cause for dread of being drawn into too close proximity with a too powerful and too unquiet Power. Sympathetically the whole Ger- man body may be thus disquieted, and Prussia may be moved with a Germanic interest.
			Prussia, advancing in population and prosperity while Austria is reitrograding-Prussia, with un- burdened fmances and thriving trade, who has already so far outstepped Austria that if the deCi- sion were to be again made to-morrow she must be placed at the head of the Germanic Confederation- Prussia is undoubtedly catching at the bidton which is falling from Austria's palsied hand. The fron- tier of Swvitzerlard is a long way, as all our tourists know, from the banis of the Aloselle; a line drawn from Coblentz to Constance would pass through five German States. When Prussia, therefore, alone, of all the Continental Powers, makes serious protest in favour of Swiss neutra- lity, it is in her character as leader and mouth- piece of all Germany that she does so. It is in behalf of Bavaria and Wurtemberg, and even on behalf of Austria herself, that Prussia volun- teers her championahip. Prussia in this must have all our sympathy; for she is of to-day, and Austria is of yesterday,-she is culminating, Austria is declining. Austria can henceforth only weaken and disunite the great German power; Prissia can unite it in bonds of brotherhood, and strengthen it by the impulse of Freedom. It is Germany in its united interest which is now threatened; but it is too remotely threatened to need that Eng-
			land should interfere. WYe doubt the close approximation of our own interest to the pre- servation of the strength of the Swiss frontier, but we cannot doubt the interest which Ger- many has in drawing close together, and pre- paring for a contest which aU things seem to render not impossible. There can be no doubt that this occupation of Chablais and Faucigny is a much more important affair to Germany than the annexation of Nice and Savoy Proper. These two provinces belong, not to Piedmont, nor to Switzerland, but to all Europe. To occupy them with French troops, and to stick up tricoloured flags upon them, is to encroach upon the great European manor. In such cases it is cus- toerary to assemble the homage, who order the encroachment to be abated. Switzerland is endeavouring to obtain the meeting of a Congress, to act as the Homage Court of Europe. If Switzerland should succeed-welL Lord Jons- B :ssarr. has declared himself ready to take part in such a Congress; and the Emperor of the FIn_T- now secms inclined to accept this expedient. We can have no objection to perform our duaT as one of the great Powers. But if, as some persons suspect, there should be an incli- nation to commit England to a piece of champion- ship which belongs, if to any, to the whole of the Powers of Europe, we are sure that no such Quixotism will be sanctioned by the common sense of the English Deoble.

			A hundred pages of official documents, presented to Parlianent under the title of a " Correspondence "with HIE MAJsTsv's Minister in Japan," intro- duce us not only to the history of a commercial mis- carriage, but to some knowledge of the most mys- terious empire in the worl:. It is not that Japan has been always or naturally that jealous and unsocial State which we have found it. Two centuries ago it admitted as much foreign inter- course as most Asiatic kingdoms, and only with- drew from contact with strangers under the in- fluence of a serious alarm. So rigorously, how- ever, has the seclusion then established been since maintained that the country until the other day was a sealed book to Europeans. We have now got a footing in this inaccessible region, but onr progress has been smal, and our prospects are not encouraging. Still, we have this advantage, -that we understand the whole case, and, as the fault has not been wholy on the side of the Japanese, there may be hopes of reconciliation and improvement.
			The Government of Japan is vested in the hands of a territorial aristocracy owning three-fourths of the soiL These feudal Princes form a species of Council, sitting at Jeddo, the capital of the empire, and the TycooN, or Sovereign, is under their control, like the old Doges of Venice in the hands of the patricians. As in most Assemblies, so in this Council, there are various parties and opinions, and it is conjectured that the ascendancy of a moderate or liberal party led to the adoption of that Treaty by which we were admitted to privileges of trade. It is not very probable that this resolution was willingly taken, or that even those who advocated the relaxation of ancient usages did so under any feeling more satisfactory than that of alarm. Our
			successes in China had been so bruited abroad that the Japanese doubted if they could refuse our overtures any longer, and accordingly, though without any goodwill, they entered into the compact by which their territory was opened. Later in the day, however, came the disaster at the Peiho, and probably a change of power at Jeddo, so that for the last few months our representatives have had to struggle against authorities ill disposed towards them, and anxious to evade the execution of the treaty.
			At first all went welL MIr. RUTERFOnD AT- cocE, our MIinister Plenipotentiary, found things as agreeable as he could fairly expect. Not only was the Treaty ratified, but the instrument itself was carried in solemn procession under a silken canopy through the principal streets of the capital, escorted by an imposing guard from a British man of war. MIarines and seamen actually marched not only along the great thoroughfares of Jeddo, but into the very precincts of the TycooN's palace. The behaviour of the people was unexceptionable. MIr. ALcocK says that the police of Jeddo is probably better managed than that of any other capital in the world. Al- though the whole population was astir, a slight cord stretched across a street proved as effectual as the strongest barrier to control the rush of the crowd, and the detachment returned to the ship without the least annoyance. For some time afterwards, too, there was no overt rupture or embroil- ment. The Japanese were clearly inclined to take advantage of their visitors by extor- tionate charges; and what with fires, earth- quakes, and petty annoyances, a residence in those parts was by no means uniformly delightful. Still, the show of good faith was maintained, and, in fact, up to the last the Japanese have conducted their opposition with great astuteness. They hope, apparently, to wear us out and disgust us with our bargain, without committing themselves to overt hostility, and unluckily they are aided in their designs by the inherent difficulties of the case and the miscbnduct of the foreign traders.
			The feudal Princes arc opposed to intercourse with strangers, partly from traditional prejudices, and partly from actual jealousy and alarm. Their position enables them not only to turn the power of the Government againat us, but to thwart the pro- visions of the Treaty in a still more direct manner. As owners of the soil they have its produce in their hands, and it depends upon their private caprices whether a mine shall be worked or a trade-road established. Then there are guilds composed of Chinese as well as natives, with exclusive privi- leges of trade, and these corporations look with no loving eye on European interlopers. If we add to these conditions, the utter novelty of the experi-
			ment, and the difficulties of communication in au almost unknown language, we shall soon understand that even a friendly Govern- ment would have had much to do before the position of Europeans could be rendered satis- factory. As it is, the influence oE Government has been thrown into the scale against us, and the natural embarrassments of the case have been pur- posely aggravated. Unfavourable sites were marked out for our settlements, though by the terms of the treaty we were entitled to a voice in such ar- rangements; delays and prevarications began to characterize the proceedings of the Japanese authorities; broils and outrages became common; and, at last, it was almost as unsafe to walk abroad in Japan as it used to be in China. All this while, however, the foreigners themselves had been taking their share in the mischief at work.
			It is not denied that our sailors, and those of otner nations, behaved themselves too commonly with rudeness to the natives, offended their sus- ceptibilities, and outraged theiz feelings. This conduct naturally generated a retaliative spirit, until, in the end, although the disposition of the people had been found decidedly amicable, foreign- ers were occasionally the objects of murderous attacks. These feelings of animosity, again, were aggravated by the proceedings of certain of our merchants. One of the stipulations of the treaty provided that we should be furnished by the Japanese with the currency requisite for the purposes of trade-a very remaonable agree- ment. It turned out, however, as we have en- plained on a former occasion, that, as the coinage of Japan was regulated, a very large profit could.
			be realized by the export of gold when obtained in exchange for silver at the rate current in the country. No Eooner was this discovery made than our traders handed in to the Japanese authorities demands for fabulous quantities of silver change, with the design, not of employing it in lawful commerce, but of turning it into gold and sending the gold to Europe. All nations are sensitive on a point like this, and so unscrupulous an expression of greed had its natural effect in estranging the Japanese from their new customers. The Japan- ese, remarks Lord Jonn RussELL with great can- dour, " may well be jealous of Europeans, who "insult their usages and carry away their gold."
			This, then, is the point at which affairs have ar- rivecL We found the Japanese people very friendly, and very well disposed in the ordinary way to trade. They are not such born traffickers as the Chinese, but, as far as lacker and porcelain could go, their goods were very much at the com- mand of the foreigner. At that time, too, the Government was either friendly or timorous, and things accordingly wore an air of promise. Then came a change of policy in the Council of State, open jealousy on the part of the Princes, and fierce assaults on the part of their armed retainers. Presently, exasperated by the incivility of foreign seamen, and alarmed by the cupidity of foreign merchants, the people themselves seemed to take up the quarrel, though never as a body, nor with anything like national animosity. Ultimately, when the Governrnent was inclined to nullify the provisions of the Treaty, all conditions were favourable to the scheme. The actual trade was very small, owing to the opposi-
			;ion of the Princes and the guilds, while the mer- chants had misbehaved themselves, and had alto- gether failed to conciliate the affections of the people. This was enough. Asiatic artifice soon compassed the rest, and the Treaty became a dead letter. Even now, however, the Japanese would probably not proceed to extremities. They regret the bargain, and would gladly be rid of us; but, unless they can do so at a less risk than that of war, they will in al likelihood submit. Perhaps the influence of coming events may operate in this direction. The Chinese expedition will, it is to be hoped, re-establish our renown, and, if we can but secure more becoming behaviour on the part of our merchants and sailors, we may yet trust to improve our intercourse with these interesting regions and really amicable people without the ugly episode of a war.

			The cream of the " Twelfth General Report from "the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England" is contained in one sentence, which sums up the whole amount of benefit received by smaUer livings from the Commissioners' fund. " The total "number of benefices and districts augmented and "endowed by the Commissioners amounts to "1,205, and the total permanent charge upon the "common fund, inclusive of grants in respect of "benefactions, exceeds the sum of 89,0001. per " annum." The " grants in respect of benefac- " tions" mentioned here are, as distinguished from annual grants, sums given once for all to parishes and districts, meeting private benefactions in the ratio of one-third, one-half, or other. The above sum total, then, we presume, represents the interest of the capital thus given out of the fund, added to the annual grants made out of the same fund.
			The reflection which this sum total gives rise to is the strictly arithmetical one, how very little a limited fund can do to raise a large class of small incomes. This is very plain arithmetic, we say, and yet it is sometimes lost sight of, simply because we forget how large a thing a class is, what a gigantic absorbent it is of augmentations, assistances, and supplements. It is an insatiable claimant, and forestaUs all brilliant results. Every issue from the bounty of your funBd goes, in fact, to filling up the void which has to be filled up before any tangible result appears. The fountain of supply has endless space to cover before the level can be raised. Ve have between 4,000 and 5,000 incumbencies -under 1501. a-year. It would be a flattering estimate of the collective effect of the whole of the Commission's bounty to pronounce that it had even filled up the gulf between what was under 3501. and 1501.
			It is fortunate for tbe Church tnat the supply of fresh men to fill up the ranks of the clergy does not depend upon any exact calculation of chances and estimate of what they are likely, in point of fact, to get. If it did it could not hold its own, but it is lucky for the clerical profession, and for other
			protessions too-that of law and medicine, certainly -that nature has not made us such calculating creatures. Happily for the effectiveness of our professions, a brilliant possibility is quite as much of a motive as a solemn certainty. We want the flutter of something bright be- fore us. Every clever young medical student has the idea that he mnay one day get his thousand pounds fees ; every sparkiing or strongheaded young lawyer maay be Lord Chancel- lor some day. A crowd of prophecies inaugurates the young man's first entrance upon the new line of life. There are thousands of immortalities, laurel crowns, and peerages in embryo, and nobody caan teU which will be the real one. To be the subject of prophecy is a gratification in itself, and this is an honour which is largely enjoyed, but it is a necessary condition of it that a man should be seen going to do something, entering into some apparent and tangible calling. If he is to be pro- phesied of he must be either a sailor or a soldier, or a doctor, or a lawyer, or a clergyman, or some- thing. Here is a stimulus, then, which sends our youth into lines of definite work, apart from the exact calculation of chances. He, at any rate, enters the list and goes in for the running. The family oracles mark him out for success, and the air around him vibrates with Sibylline utter- ances.

			The clerical profession is especially subject to this contrast of a bright beginning and a barren future, and is certainly quite equal to the other professions as an enchantress and mistress of spells and allurements; quite on a par with them in making things joyful and pleasant at first, and sobering down their hue afterwards, in laying out nice garden scenery at first, which gradually loses its coloured beds and glistening shrubs, and shades off into moorland. We are speaking of it now simply as a profession and upon the mercantile ground-the light in which a responsible relative or guardian would look at it in behalf of a young man whose interests were intrusted to hinm. The Chinese have a way of teaching religion and morals by gardening. The nomenclature of their very streets, indeed, suggests sublime truths to the highly favoured children of that paternal gove,nment, who cannot, of course, be otherwise than honest, upright; faithful, and deeply religious as they walk through the Street of Probity, the Street of Innocence, the Street of Purity, the Street of Lofty Serenity, the Street of Holy Meditation, and thae Street of Celestial Joy. But the Chinese garden is the prin- cipal instructress; it allegorizies by peonies and chrysanthemums, conveys lessons in the shape of borders and parterres, and lectures by moralizing citrons and olives. The Chinese garden receives you with a great flowery show, and colour, which dazles the eye in spite of a group of trees of solemn and dark foliage in the distance, which is intended as a hint of destiny to the wiso, to prtvent undue prezent ezhilaration. The visitor saunters care- lesslv on till a terrific precipice of ten feet
			reminds him of his moral danger. He re- covers himself, and is pleased to think that he is not yet a lapsed and ruined creature; he follows the guidance of the path till he comes to his next lesson, which is conveyed at a sudden turn by means of a perfect artificial wilderness of 20 yards square; he pauses and imbibes the intended warning that the flowery path of pleasure leads to a barren journey's end. Reegded simply as a mercantile speculation the clerical profession is but apt to ini- tate the Chinese garden. There is no calling that starts fairer and brighter. The boy has all the ad- vantages the best of schools can give him. He goes up to College, and there consorts with the sons of the highborn and wealthy, enjoys their amusements, catches something of their spirit, and is the gentle- man at large for three years. The path, however, now takes a sudden turn, and if he has not-which we hope he has not-fallen down the intermediate precipice, he finds himself in a year or two on a sandy barren level in the shape of a curacy of 10 01. a-year, beyond which he does not see his way in the least. He may by great luck get a small living of 501. more value, but there, at any rate, he sticks for the term of his natural life. Such is the dead flat to which all these flowery paths lead. If he has a poor population of 5,000, he may agitate till he gets an augmentation of 501. from the Ecclesiastical Commission. But a limited fund cannot supply everybody. It cannot buy Bishops palaces and render poor incumbents comfortable, and our dead level of small livings remains com- paratively little altered by the most skilful distri- bution of the contents of that fund.
			But, as we have said, fortunately for the Church, we do not act in these matters upon any rigid calculation of chances. Independently of the higher motives, which take large numbers into the ministry of the Church-motives to which we do not refer here, because they are beside the present question-the whole body of associations connected with the Church, its historical character, its great names and reminiscences, and its venerable institutions, act upon the imagination, and draw men into a profession which promises high occupa- tion and gives a recognized rank. And in this point of view an establishment is, after all, no bad investment on the part of the nation. It attracts a vast number of private incomes into the Church, which are eked out by the benefice into some- thing like a decent maintenance, and which thus make, as it were, a benefice of what in itseL hardly was one. The Church has the advantage of the clergyman's private fortune, which goes to uphold the respectability of the ministry of the Church, adds to its position and influence, and is often directly bestoweed more or less on public and reli- gious objects. This is practically the way in which our small livings are augmented. The augmenta- tion from the Ecclesiastical Commission will never do very much for them, but English capital irrigates the whole of English ground, and the Church comes in for its share of it. Our establishment is, in fact, augmented undesignedly by cur wealth as a nation coming by this natural law into it.

			Our remarks upon the state of the General Post-office have already produced an official inquiry into the condition of that establishment. The POSTaASTER-GENERAL has appointed a " Commis- "sion" to investigate " the working of the Circu-
			lation Department," and the Commissioners have notified to the officers of that department that they are ready to receive from them any suggestions In writing, or any delegates who may be deputed by any class or section for tho purpose of direct con- ference. So far, so good. The Commission can hardly fail of hearing a certain amount of trath, but we beg to say that an inquiry thus instituted and thus conducted will certainly not satisfy the desires of the public or the real exigencies of the case.
			To begin vith, we are not so much as informed even of the names of the Commissioners. We only know that they are the nominees of the Post-office authorities-of the PosTmAsER-G&amp;NERAL or some of his colleagues-it may be of Sir RowLAND HMr himself. Nobody could accept as satisfactoiy the report of such a Commission. We dare say the Commissioners may be upright and intelligent men, but, if anything like finality is to attend their proceedings, distrust will attach to them from the very outset. Establishments are not to be judged of by themselves. When such institutions are thought to require reform they are scrutinized from without. The Commissioners charged with the inquiry receive their appoint- ments and their instructions from superior and independent authority, and conduct their duties in a public uncompromising spirit. We cannot, of course, assume that the PosTrrATs=r-GmN-RA's Commission may not be composed of competent or impartial members, but we do see very distinctly that it cannot command public confidence. It is appointed by the chief officers of the very department suspected of inefficiency; it will shape its proceed- ings according to directions given by the same authorities ; to the same authorities it will make
			its report, and the whole matter will begin and end within the valls of the establishment. That is not the kind of inquiry now needed. If the PosT- MASTER-GENERAL chooses to institute this prelimi- nary scrutiny for his own private information, well and good ; but the questions which have been pub- licly raised can only be settled by a more public and independent tribunal.
			WVe must next observe that the scope of the inquiry as now stated is by no means so compre- hensive as it should be. Our report charged the Post-office with general insufficiency when judged by the needs of the day, and alleged that this in- sufficiency was due to the double effect of a parsi- monious expenditure-viz., defective accommoda- tion and underpaid service. As a consequence of the pressure thus produced, we showed that the department was under constant temptation to shirk or neglect its duties, and in particular that news- papers had been gradually deprived of the advan- tages of the post, until at last they were threat- ened with the total loss of their ancient character and privileges. Now, it is perfectly obvious that these imputations cannot be met by the mere receipt of evidence on " the relative positions and " duties" of certain Post-office servants. Such evidence, however fearlessly given, or however im- partially recorded, can at best but enlighten the authorities on the discontents prevailng among
			the officers in their employ. There is plenty to beI learnt in that direction, and plenty to be done; but there is also much to be done besides. The public has its own concern in the matter, as well as
			the staff of the establishment. The Post-office! servants want a reconsideration of their duties and their salaries; the public is calling for such an
			administration of the Post-office as shall make it' the best, cheapest, most convenient, and most available medium for the diffLusion of intelligence. The Commissioners just appointed may possibly do something towards satisfying the letter-carrie's, but they will assuredly do nothing towards satisfying the country.
			We must once more place this subject in its true light before the publi; for the questions in- volved are of a very singular character. The Post- office is not charged with corruption, malversation, or waste. It is not even accused of mismanage- ment in the ordinary sense of the term, for it would perhaps be impossible to give the Dublic better service on the same principles or out of the same means. What we say is, that the introduc- tion of the penny postage system has rendered the
			accommodation at the command of the est-ablish- ment utterly inefficient, and that the desire of saving a large surplus for the national revenue has prevented such an employment of the resources of the department as would have put things straight again. The natural result of such conditions is " scamped" workmanship. The Post-office, instead of welcoming any new demands upon its services, as a national establishment ought to do, evades its duties and curtails its work. Some of its proper business it shifts on to the Ehoulders of its cus- tomers; some it altogether refuses. News-letters, or newspapers, have suffered most of alL For some years past there has been a steady desire on the part of the Post-office authorities to shut us out of the letter-box. The question of the newspaper stamp was worked by these gentlemen to the general disadvantage of newspapers altogether. Every fresh arrangement brought us some fresh dis- ability, till at last comes the naled proposal to deny us any special recognition, and to treat our daily issues just like carriers' parcels or ordinary books. Sir Row-ao lain will say that we have so grown in bulk and circulation that we can no longer be identified as our former selves. No doubt. we have, and so has every other thing and institution in modern Eng- land, except the Post-office. It is the very gist of our complaint that, whereas the extension of national concerns and interests has brought about the necessary expansion of newspapers as the natural organs of public correspondence, the Post- office, which should carry this correspondence, has remained so stationary, from stint and saving, as to be no longer equal to its duties.
			Such a case as this is obviously not to be disposed of by a private Commission. We ask-, in the name of the public, for a Parliamentary inquiry Into the subject. That is the only inquiry which will satisfy the country. We wish to see it certified in plain language and on independent authority how far the partial expenditure of the Post-office revenue upon the Post-office service is sufficient for the performance of that service. We wish to hear from unimpeachable testimony what are the defects of the accommodation in St.
			jsnarumis-ie-txrana, anc what amount of reason really attaches to the complaints of the servants. When we have obtained this information we shall be able to trace the imperfections of the service to their true source. The reality of those imperfee- tions is matter of common and daily experience. Apart from the treatment of newspapers, the irregu- larities of the service in general are greater and more numerous than they should be, as the letters in our columns frequently show. All this we should like to see rectified. It cannot be for the public interest that revenue should be raised by imperfect performance of public service. That is one of the worst methods of taxation. If the Post-office re- quires more of its income for its own purpose than it now appropriates, it should be allowed to take it. The deficiency in the contribution to the revenue, if any, would be well made up from a less noxious source of profit; but we are perfectly convinced that in the Post-office, as in all other estab]ishments, better service will be found ulti- mately identical -with greater gain.

			REPAm;S xN =E NAy.-It was stated by t'he Surveyor of the Navy, in a repDrt of the committee ap- pointed by the Treasury to inquire into the Navy Estimates, that at tho end of 15 years, on an average, the hull of eaeh ship in the navy requires a complete and extensive repair. And further, that the duration of a ship of war cannot bo estimated at more than 30 years. The Surveyor took for his guidance the average of the 10 years from 1849 to 1859 when 35 ships of the line and 46 frlgates were removed from the effective list of the navy. We much fear that none of our "converted" ships, nor indoed any of our finest speci- ineus of naval architecture, will stand the wear and tear for the periods assigned to them by the Naval Surveyor; and it is supposed, when he made the above statements, he alluded to the duration of sailing ships only, for w-e have had a few warnings lately as to the future fate of our Victorias, Howes, Duneans, and Diadems, by the introduction of steam into ships of war. We have found that, instead of requiring a complete repair once in 15 years only, that at many months are sometimes sufficient to send a ship into dock. The rapid manner in which the navy has been recon- structed in some Esgree accounts for this premature decay, in consequence of the unseasoned timber which has been so extensively used, and which from the limited supnly In hand could not well have been avoided; but, In addition to the use of indifferent mnctgrid, we mu3st reckon upon ouxr steam ships of war becoming rotten sooner than our calling ships did, In consequence of the beat produced by the volcanic fires we put into them. Shipwr7ghts know to a plank where to "prick" for rotten wood in a steamship, With unerring preclsion they try her just in the " wake of the boilers," where the alternations of heat and cold are the greatest, and which are sufficient to destroy the best sea. soned timber. It is in these places that steamships require repairs oftenest. There Is, however, another destructive power that disables a steatmship of war in a very m3arked manner, and that is the " shake of the screw." Long-con. binued screw propulsion at full speed sOOe teD3 aWe. We have had indications in the Princess I,oyal, 91, now nnder repair at Portsmouth, of the destructive effects of tbh vIbratory motion of the screw. She has been almost rebuilt sbaft, after having passed through one commlssion only. it La said, also, in confrmation of this, that the whole of the Channel fleet is leaky, and that the Royal Albert, the flag ship, will require a thorough caulking.

It proposes to contract with public companies for the completion of three lines: -L From the sea to Constantine; 2, from Algiers to Blidah; 3, from St. Denis-du-Sig to Oran, with a continuation to the port; the capital not to ex- ceed 58,000,000f., of which the Government wil advance 6,000,000f. as a bonus to the contracting company. The Government will further guarantee 5 per cent, on the capital subscribed, to commence 10 years after the date of the concession. The Government will, moreover, grant a lease of 99 years to the contracting company.
			Admiral Baudin, who has been lately appointed to the command of the 3Iarine Department at Al- giers, has quitted Paris to take possession of his post.
			An eminent sbipwright of Bordeaux has presented to the Emperor the model of a gunboat constructed on a system to be propeUed without steam. The Emperor has approved the model, and has or- dered the inventor to build a gunboat according to his plan.
			The Emperor is to review next week the troops lately arrived in Paris.' This review, which is to be on a grand scale, is to take place on the racecourse of Longchamps in the Bois de Boulogne, which the Emperor has adopted for these military sights, the Champ de Mars, of revolutionary notoriety, being now completely neglected.
			The new Sugar Bill appears to have been objected to by the French refiners aS fixing at too high a rate per cent. the yield which is to enable the exporter to claim the restitution of the duty paid on the raw article when brought to France. At present that rate is fixed at 75 per cent. for inferior qualities, and at 78 per cent. for the better kinds. The bill proposes to raise those figures to 80 and 83 per cent. respectively, and it is that change which is objected to. The Consi'ittisonnde supports the op- posits view of the question, and maintains that the French sugar refiners need not fear to compete on such conditions with any rivals in foreign markets. After alluding to the position of the zugar trade in other countries, it says:-
			" The question, as regards the drawback, reduces Itself to these terms,-the general lowering of the duties on sugar wiU necessarily have for a result to diminish to a considera ble extent the yield of the tax for the first few years; and the expos4 de3 motifs of the budget estimates the loss to the Treasury at 44,000,0001. for 1861. At the moment at which the Treasury makes this enormous sacrifice for a great gene- ral interest, must another be imposed on it for the ad- vantage of a powerful and prosperous branch of manufac- ture ? The latter sacrifice would be, It is true, of very little Importance, for under the empire of the new tariffs the difference between the annual restitutions of duties to be made bythe Treasury, whether the rate of yield is to be maintained at 75 per cent., or the rate of 80 per cent. is to adopted, will only be about 1,500,000f. Moreover, the In- terest of the refinig trade Is in this matter the same as the Interest of the export trade and of mercantilo shipping. Nevertheless, if too great a difference between the legal yield and the real one were allowed, quantities of sugar, more and mora considerable, would enter by the agency of the refiners who manufactura for exportation, and would be consumed at home without having paid the duty; and it will be seen that that would constitute a not very legitimate competition with native manufac- turers. Such are the general terms of the question. We have not the pretension to indicate to the Legislative Body what solution would best concUiate the ifferent inter- eats concerned. We will onlysay that, though a fault would be committed if our refiners were to be placed in a disad- vantageous position as regards their foreign competitors, an imperative duty wFould be neglected if serious account were not to be taken, especlally under existing circumstances, of the interest of the public finances."
			Accounts from Turin state that a strong opposi- tion is being formed in the Chamber of Deputies against the Ministry. The ultra-Liberals say that the Minister is not moving sufficiently quick. Pre- parations are being made to organize the new king- dom, which is to be called Regno Italico It is to be divided into six provinces-Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria, AEmilia, Tuscany, and Sardinia-of which the capitals are to be MIilan, Turin, Genoa, Bologna, Ilorence, and Cagliari. The army is to be com- posed of six corps, each corps to consist of three divisions.
			A letter from St. Petersburg of the 2d inst. savs:-
			" The police have lately paid domiciliary visits to some literary celebrities in this city. They have seized, among others, the papers of M. Pawloff, the Professor of History. It is said that several persons have been compromised by these papers. The individuals arrested at Kiew, Charkoff, and Xasan stil remain incarcerated. The police cannot discover that they have been guilty of high treason, of which they were accused ; but documents have been found proving that these persons belonged to a vast association, whose object is to diffuse the blessings of education among the mass of the population. The question of the emancipation of the serfs is that which chiefly occupies the attention of the Government. The interest in it is greater since the delegates of the 20 Governments have been summoned to St. Petersburg to de- ilberate on the question and to give their opinions in writing. The day after the deputies were received by the Emperor a serious difference of opinion arose between them and Count Panin, former Minlster of Justice, lately named President of the commission. The delegates demanded that the P.usslan nobility should have a voice in al affairs of State-in fact, they demanded a representative government. Count Panin denied the right of the nobility to make any such demand, and told them that they were chosen solely to give their opinions, andtosupplytheGoverrnentwithinformation on the subject oftbeeemancipatSonoftbopeasants. Thesame question was raised by deputies who came here last autumn, but that attempt drew down on them a reprimand from the Government. The majority of the delegates now at St. Petereburg hold radical opinions, and may give the Govern- ment some trouble. The Minister of Agriculture has given orders for the best agricultural instruments to be purchased at thenext Exhibition in Paris. These instruments, forthe purchase of which a large sum has been aUocated by the Government, are intended to serve as models for tho Rus- sian manufacturers. A report of a change of Ministry, some time prevalent, is not improbable, inasmuch as the greator number of the Ministers are invalids, some are unpopular, and others wish to retire. Counts Panin and Mouravieff are the most unpopular, inasmuch as public opinion accuses them of being opposed to every species of reform. Among the last measures a(lopted by the Government is an order to confiscate all the property, real or personal, of aU those who were guilty of fraud in supplying the hospitals and tho army during the war in the Crimea."

			The expedition the other day to Thonon, on the Chablais shores of the Lake of Geneva, will have for its effect the occupation of the neutralized provinces by the French. Probably those who were at the bottom of it had no other object in view than to cut short by this summary method all further diplo- matic controversy. The AFoniteur announces- Ithat -the Minister of Foreign Affairs has intimated to the municipality of Thonon, in Savoy, that the inten- tion of the Emperor, as already expreased to the
			Savoyard deputation, is to preserve the commercial iaterests of Fauciguy and Chablais by establishing in their favour a commercial zone sdmilar to the one which al-eady exists at Gex.
			The Moniteur continues to insert addresses from districts of the said provinces, expressive of the great satisfaction, &amp;c., of the people at the annexa- tion of their country to France. We all know the value of such addresses, in which very probably, like the celebrated addresses after the attentat, most of the signers had no other share than affixing their names, the document being already prepared to save time and trouble.
			The Moniteur also announces that the Emperor wil hold no receptions on Easter Sunday, nor on the following Thursday; and it was men- tioned yesterdaf that His MIajesty performed his religious duties with much devotion on Holy Thursday. HIow, then, can it be believed that so pious a Court could by any possibility be com- prised in the excommunication ? Yet the im- prudent zeal of the Graudguillots of the C(Ytstitu- tio,slel, and the Limayracs of the Patrie, wil end by making the public entertain some slight mis- givings about the matter. The former has given us a long article, in which the said excommunication is proved to be no excom- munication at all-hardly a political protest; and is so forbearing, so gentle, as to be hardly de- Eerving the name of censure. If this be the case, why does not the Con.stitbdionnel publish the docu- ment ? The Si&amp;le very naturally laughs at these scruples, and clearly thinks the Government acts in a cowardlly manner in keeping it out of the Moniteur, and in not holding it up, not so much to public anger, for it is too worth- less for that, but to publo ridicule. The Sine knows the value of such exposures from the effect produced by its own researches in Trisfram Shandy and it. bold promulgation of Dr. Slop's (or Baluze's) malediction. It is pretty certain that the Emperor, whose piety is undoubted, thinks very lightly of any censures which his efforts to rescue the Savoyards for instance, from the oppression of which they had been so long victims, and to introduce them to hap- piness and liberty, may expose him to. It is pretty certain that he views with pbilosophic in- difference or contempt the harmless anger of this aged priest; yet who, if the liberties of man were not in question, might win respect from those who admire courage by the moral grandeur exhibited in braving to the last, defenceless and alone, two powerful Sovereigns in a course which, thoughwe may disapprove, he at least considers just, and who believes that he is despoiled by the avowed hostility of one and stifled by the oppres- sive piety of the other. The equanimity of the Emperor wil not, I repeat, be disturbed by the querulousness of the Pope. Yet if M. Pauline Limayrac goes on torturing himself by quoting St. Augustin and St. Thomas the Angelic Doctor (and 3I Pauline Limayrac quoting the Fathers of the Church is of itself a capital joke) to show that the Imperial Government is left un- scathed by this excommunication, people will, I fear, end by attributing this nervousness of the Go- vernmental press to certain qualms of conscience in those who diotnte tn it
			A despatch from Madrid speaks again of the arrest of Elio and some other important" person- ages," near Cardona. The " important personages" are, in all probability, the Count of Montemolin and his brother. Cardona is a small town in Cata- lonia, not far from Manresa, and in the direction of the mountains. This would show that they were hastening to escape into France on the failure of Ortega's revolt. If the Princes are really pri- soners, what will the Queen do with them? Will she have her cousins shot, or confined in a fortress as the Duchess de Berri was by Louis Philippe? If their lives are spared, Ortega wiU have a chance in his favour.
			I have received the following letter from Mladrid, dated the 3d inst. Part of it I have already antici- pated:-
			" MADRID, ArRi 3.
			Since yesterday the people of Madrid have been ap. prized of alarning news, and to-day's Gaette confirms but a small portion of the news whioh was ln circulation yester- day. The Captain-General of the Balearic Isles, Don aime Ortega, came with two foreign steamers chartered at Mar- seilles to the coasts of Castillon (kingdom of Valen- cia); he landed at San Carlos la Rapita, and pro- claimed, with about 4,000 troops of the Line, Charles VI., and the temporal power of the Pope. At the same time a band of armed Carlists has appeared in the province of Burgos, commanded by the well-known brothers, Ilierros; Charles VI. was also proclaimed by them. The Gazettc puxblishes a clrcular ordering the Governors of provinces to obey no orders save those emanating from the Government. The Balearlc Isles Majorca, Minorca, and Ivica, are greatly agitated, though nothing is known of what may be going on there after the troops left. Some say that the artiUlerymen of the fortresses of Mahon refased to take part in the insurrection; others affirm that Charles VI. has been proclaimed In the Isles. The inhabitants of Ivica are known for their retro- grade ideas; however, the people of Majorca and Minorca were never thought to be Carlists.
			" The question generally asked is, how could the Govern. ment be Ignorant of so vast a conspiracy, particularly as a week ago telegrams were sent from Parls, Inquiring whether Madrid had risen, or whether anything new had come to pass in Spain. But the most serious report in circulation since the day before yesterday Is, that the Emperor of Morocco refuses to slgn the peace, and that he consents to pay only 200,010,000 reals, and that on condition that Spain wil abandon Tetuan immediately. If this turn out true the rising of General Ortega would be a serious affair.
			" General Ortega has been recently patronlsed by O'Don- nell he belonged to the extreme Progresists party until after the insurrection of 1843, in which he took part against Espartero. He afterwards affected to be a Moderado, and since 1858 he became very intimate vith O'Donnell, who sent him as superior military chief to the Balearie Isles. He has ever been a political adventurer. Principles he had none. Nevertheless he had acquaintances and friends In all classes and in all political parties.
			" Men of sound principles saw wlth regret the favour bestowed by Royalty on the Vicalvarist generals who rose in 1854 against 'Intrigues which dlshonoured the Throne, (Mlanzanares Proclamation, 1854). The example of Gene- ral Dulce and other Vicalvarist officers, rewarded as they were so lavishly by the Qaeen, may have proved too tempting,, and it Is not extraordinary thatGeneral Ortega shouid have wished toimitate'their conduct.
			" A strange coineidence is In the letters received from Paris mentioning a forthcoming movement in Valencia and that the rising of General Ortega should have taken place precisely on the coast of Vaencia. Troops of infantry and cavalry have left Madrid by the railway for Valencia. General Jos6 de la Concha, who was coming to MIadrid from Valencla, had orders to return, which he did from Alcazar do San Juan.
			"It is sald that General Echague's divlsion has embarked, going also to Valencia."
			The Government has received reports from MU. Laity and Pietri, senators, commissioned by the Emperor to ascertain the state of the public feelina in Savoy and in the county of Nice. They state that the annexation to France is popular throuah- out Savoy. Some apprehension prevails at Wice that the fashionable visitors who used to make that town their residence in winter will abandon it now that it is annexed to France, and that the trades- people will consequently be ruined by the departure of their best customers.

			SAVOY.
			I (FBOM OUR OWS CORRBPOD-NDT.)
			CIIAmBERY, ArPm 3. | Since I last wrote to you the situation in this part of Savoy has changed very little. The policy .0 canrying out the annesation by degrees and with-
			out noise, which was then beginning, has been since consistently continued, so that at this moment it migCht be said that Savoy belongs but nomrinally to Piedmont. The process of de-Piedmontizhn, the countryais well nigh completed. OE thePieda cntese uniform onlyfainttraces ars to bs perceived; eventhe stray soldiers, either on leave or in charge of some of the dep6ts, have disappeared. There are still ?ome specimens of the Carabinieri visible, but more like the sporadlo remnant of an extinct species than the representative of the executive powrer In the country. The polce and the custom-house officers exhibit the greatest tenacity among thosa vearing an uniform, but, althoagh they are stil extant, they have been considerably transEormed;o heir uniform alone is Piedmnontese; they themselves are exclusively Savoyards, all the Piedmontese having been sent awvay.
			In the public offices the same process has been graduaUvy completed. The Piednontese element is eliminated, and replaced by the Savoyard. Afr tho departure of the Governor of Chambery tho ex- Governor of ywhecy came to take his place; tnis latter, being an Ita]ian, has now likewise been re- called, and the Chevaler Dbpasqueer, a member of the Cours d' Appel of Chambery, named in his place. The Svndics, who are named by the Governor, have Elkewise understood the signs of the times, and eli those who were not zealous adherents of the French party have resigned. Their places have not been filled up, and the municipal guntas have taken the execative power into their hands. The Piedmontese troops having departed, and the French being con- sidered as on their psasage, the National Guard has taken everywhere charge of the public securityand order. In the diffierent branches of administration only some of the Piedmonte3s heads of departments remain to wind up accounts and aiwirs, all the rest having left for Piedmont.
			I have frequently had opportunity of speaking of the Piedmontese burcaucracy and its excluasive character. It had preserved it intact in Savoy, and the occupation of all higher posts by Piedmontese was not one of the smalest grievances of the Savoyards against the Government. This exclu- siveness was so jealously adhered to that the lower Savoyard employIs had scarcely a chance of rising to the higher offices. This explains, in a great measure, the readiness of the smaller esnplomys to enter heart and soul into the French agitation, perhaps even more so than the Government itself wished it. Thus it comes that replacing these Piedmontese higher employiS by Savoyards is in reality nothing more but giving the Government into the hands of the partisans of France.
			The whole transition is managed gradually and quietly, so that on some not very distant day the country will look out for the Piednmontese and not find them. Except in the finance department very little, if anything, remains already but custom- houses; salt and tobacco monopolies are such in- tricate affairs that they take more time. From what I see I cannot say that this leaving of the Piedmontese cmpinyis ex;cites any great sentimen- tality on either side. There are so many places lost on one side, and sO many gained on the other ; this seems to me the present feelina.
			lVhilo thus everything is prepared for French Przfets and Sons-Prefets the firat battalionof the 80th Line Regiment, with staff and band, is au conmplet in Chambery. The second battalion is on its way; two companies will be to-day at St. Jean de MIaurienne, and two others on the way there from Susa. The pro- gramme of passing company by company has been strictly adhered to, and it is only from St. Jean de Maurienne that they come by two companies to Chambery. The battalion which is here has in- stalled itself as if to remain,-has its Post-office opened, and everything arranged for a longer stay. A colonel of the staffhas been sent up from MElan to study the plan for the cantonment of the French troops in Savoy. But except in Chambery, and on the road from the Mont Cenis, there are as yet no French troops anywhere else in the country, so that one can always keep up the fiction that there is no military occupation, only a passage home of the French troops.
			This fiction, even if every one can see through it, is of considerable moment in case of a necessity to consult the wishes of the population. By another of those contradictions with which this Savoy ques- tion abounds those who were loudest in speaking of the French sympathies of the country seem to care least about giving that 'clat to the cession of Savoy which a great manifestation in favour of France would give to it; as, likeewise, those whom one might think most eager to spread the application of the principle of universal suffrage aU over the world are least eager to try this principle in Savoy
			'while it Is those, who have been until lately the most determined adversaries of the annexation, who feel most the necessity of setting everything at rest by appealing to universal suflrage.
			There are those who like to tax others with the inconsistency of being annexionists in Tuscany and anti-annexionists in Savoy. One might return the compliment, and saythat, if universal suffrage is the principle on which the present state of things is based in France, the Savoyards who are to belong to France ought to have likewise the advantages given by this principle.
			This unwillingness to appeal to universal suffrage on the part of those whom one would think most eager for it cannot but excite the suspicion that they fear the result may not be quito so brilliant as they would like. Their thesis is, the whole country is enthusiastic for France, and in order to sup- port it they require a large proportion of voters ; but tbey know as well, if not better than anybody else, that the Immense majority are passive in a matter which they think already decided without them, and that it would be difficult to stir them up to participate in the voting. They urge, therefore, that it is necessary to put an end as soon as possible to the uncertainty, and that without waiting for orders the municipalities ought to get up in every commune addresses of adhesion to France. Elected by the country, they say they represent the wishes of the country, and they can finish the whole matter by speaking in its name. The committee which has been formed with this view at Chambery has therefore advised the com- munes to hasten to get up their addresses, and not troublethemselves in so imDortant amovementabout legality, promising that those who would be foremost will not be forgotten by the French Government. In order to facilitate matters prlnted schedules have been sent, requiring only signatures. It is scarcely necessary to point out that a municipality which has been elected for administrative purposes and consists in the largest towns of Savoy of not more than 30 members can scarcely be looked upon as representing the population in a question which implies a radical chaDge.
			But, although these new manceuvres are an in- dubitable sign of weakness in the French party, one must not flatter one's-self that if universal suffrage were resorted to for the whole of Savoy there would be a majority against the annexation to France. Even if the majority in the country had a decided opinion in this respect-which it has not-as its adversaries have aU the power and influence of the Government at their command, it would stil
			have almost insurmountable difficulties in making its views triumph. Even in the three neutral- ized districts-where I have no doubt that the gene- ral tendency of all those unconnected with the Government, and having nothing to expect from it, is for an union with Switzerland-this majority, badly worked and led as it is, would have little chance against its less numerous but active adver- saries.
			The bestproof of thisis in the elections which have taken place lately for Parliament; out of the aix Deputies which Northern Savoy has to send only one has been returned who is favourable to Switzer- land. The first day's voting, in which the majority remained to the candidates of the Swiss party, was not decisive, because the numbers of voters required by the law had not taken part in it; baUoting was consequently resorted to, and the majority was re- versed.
			It was a grievo6s mistake on the part of the ad- herents of Switzerland not to see the importance of the Parliamentary elections, and the help which the protest of North Savoy by its deputies woiud have given to the cause of Switzerland in a conference or congrems. Their adversaries saw the mistake, and used all their strength and activity to succeed in the balloting. 'With the influence which the Government had at its disposal, with the comparatively high qualification which the law requires for the voter in that poor country, with the ignorance which reigns in that out-of-+he-way district, and the obstacles which were thrown in the way of an am,itation from Geneva, it was certainly not easy to work, but, nevertheless, more might have been done had the resources at hand been properly worked.
			The failure putr the three diEtricts into the samae position as the rest of Savoy, which would not have been the case otherwise. One voice out of air
			especially if this one is timid, is too weak to make an opposition not to be soon silenced. A protest of all the six deputies of North Savoy would have, on the contrary, forced France to make a difference with regard to that part of Savoy. She might have appealed to universal suffrage, but this would have given only additional strength to the Swiss party, because it would have given the decision into the hands of the masses, who are for Switzerland.
			Now nothing remains but to leave the thing in the hands of the Conference, which seems tolerably certain The question Is only on what base the Conference is to meet. It is not probable that France will recognize the claims of Switzerland to those districts while the Powers have only a right to speak on the question of neu- trality assured to those districts by the Treaty of 1815. The only chance for Switzerland is in the 12,000 siguatures from the three districts, which might be used in the Conference to obtain that these districts should vote separately from the rest of Savoy. But even this concession is useless, unless the Swiss party is likewise assured the ppasibillty of working its majority. With the almost certainty of belonging to France, there are feopeopleinclined to begin the change of rule by an opposition to the new rulers, who may be supposed to remember their early friends and late enemies. 'Unti this influence, now exercised against everything not French, can be neutralized, the whole country will have gradually passed into the actual possession of the adherents of France, and even those will have been discouraged in the hopeless struggle who have held out hitherto.
			Thus the prospects of North Savoy and Switzer- land have decidedly been dimmed of late, and, unless something unexpected turns up, you may consider the whole of Savoy, if not in form, at any rate in reality, as annexed to France. Ailvoting, if it should take place, you may c13ss among the formalities just as much as the nomination of a prefect would be. As for this quiet little town, it looks already as French as can be. There are only a few hundred Flrench troops here,but in a place where threepersons look like a crowd parties of four or five French uniforms must decidedly alter the appearance of the streets. Then the sentries before the house of the colonel, before the army post-office, before the bar- racks, the sounds of the band in the day, and the drums which beat the retreat in the evening, are all things which give Chambery the appearance of a French garrison town. Nor are there any of the flags and decorations left which gave to the presence of the French an exceptional character. They are no more gnests, but people at home.
			ADnIL 4.
			This morning the proclamation of Victor Em- manuel to the inhabitants of Savoy and Nice is posted up on all corners. Its contents were already known from the French papers, which had had it before it reached those most nearly concerned. It leaves no doubt that the population will be consulted. Nor could Sardinia do otherwise. Waving al its new acquisitions on the principle of 17lpular suffrage, it could not barter away her provinces without at least going through the form of voting. The recall of the Piedcmontese functionaries is noticed as coming from a wish to leave the inhabitants free in their choice, as if the appointment of French partisans was not calculated to bias the voting in another direction. I have always maintained, and stiU maintain, that voting after a treaty of cession is ridiculous, espe- cially if no other alternative is given but to belong to Prance, and people are told that they belong no more to Sardinia. The whole wil possess, therefore, only an artistic Interest, showing the skill of the chief actors, which, from what we know of them already, requires scarcely a new proof.

			SARDINIA.
			(FoRM oUw OWiN COsRUONDNT.)
			TURIN, APrTh 4.
			Neithier House of Parliamelit meit yesterday. The Sonate wiUl sit to-day, but only to constitute itself by tho appointment of the President's office. The President himself is named by the King, who has in this instance only confirmed in his dignity the Marquis Alfieri di Sostegno.
			The Lower House wil also meet to-day, but only for-the "verification of powers," that is, to pro- nounce on the result of the deputies' inquiry into each other's election. This preliminary proceeding began yesterday in the nine Uffizi, or sections of the House. I understand that most of the elec- tions have already been duly sifted and found correct, so that there is reason to hope that this un- avoidable forrality wiUl pass off with but Ettle dis- cussion, and Parliament wiU be allowed to proceed to real business. In the year 1S57, as the reader wiU remember, this verification of powers took up several weeks (25 sittings). and made a woful hole in the duration of the session; but at that epoch the Government was strongly interested in a very keen search into the elections of certain clerical mem- bers whom they were anxious to unseat. This year, on the contrary, hardly one of the "blacks" has been returned, not even the great leader of the party, Count Solara della Mfargherita. The Chamber is as yet aU of one colour, like the world in the first gray morning dawn, before sun- light has caUed forth its harmoniousvariety of hues. The nation has sent nothing but patriots to Parlia- ment, and these are but too willing to drive on the Government faster than it would go. Al that Cavour wants of the Parliament is simply their sanction to-nay, their acquiescence in-the Savoy treaty, and this will be but too easily obtained. It would be mere tampering with truth to say that 99, at least, out of 100 Italian Liberals not only fully expected that the emancipation of any considerable part of the Peninsula wrould lead to the loss of the Transalpine provinces, but deemed also the cession, at least, of Savoy, if not of Nice, as de- sirable as it was inevitable. From the first rumour of the particulars of tho Plombieres interview the subject was familiarly entertained and looked upon as pure matter of course. The Peace of ViUafranca and the magniloquent professions of Napoleon had certainlygivenmen'sthoughts adifferent turn, and, as since ViUlafranea the Emperor has behaved very pas- sively,if not quite hostilely to the Italian cause,the re- vival of claims so long and so often disavowed could hardly fail to create painful surprise and disappoint- ment. However made up the mind of the Italians might be to the separation of Savoy, it was notas, I said, equaUy indifferent to the sacrifice of Nice, and in either case it was keenly alive to any viola- tion, be it of the individual rights of the people of the provinces, be it of the fundamental principle of the constitution of any free State, which forbids the sale or barter of lands, andstill moro of men, with- out the free consent, not only of the parties con- cerned, but of the whole nation as in Parliament renresented.
			The KIing's Speech announces a treaty already " stipulated," but conditional both on Parlia- mentary approbation and on poDular suffrage. But there is not one man sitting ini either House who can for one moment doubt that the contract respecting Savoy and Nice is definitive and irrevo- cable, so far at least as the Government and State of Sardinia are concerned, Any discussion in Par- liament, or appeal to public vote, woald be a mere mockery. This, as I say, every senator and deputy k;nowYs, and he is fully aware that he must makeo np his mind to one of these three courses :-first, im- pugn the treaty itself, and move to have it rescinded -in which case the proposer, even if he were al- lowed to go through his resolution, would soon find himself in a minority of one ; secondly, to hold his tongue and accept the treaty,-a line of conduct which would brand the Parliament and every member in it with abject servility and cowardice - or, finally, to enter a protest agaiust the treaty and abstain from voting,-and this is the only incident ILkely to diversify the sameness of the whole of this dolorous transaction.
			There are orators, I believe, not only among the extreme Rladicals, men of the stamp of Cattaneo, Sirtori, and Guerrazzi, but even men of just and moderate principles and consCeontious followers of Cavour's lead, who speak as if they were bent on giving the King's Minister a piece of their mind. Equivocation and prevarication enough there has been on the part of the Sardinian Govern- ment throughout this Savoy proceeding. I need not here recapitulate the particulars of their con- duct. Their only plausible defence lies in those pithy words, " Needs must where the - Emperor drives." Napoleon either actnally com- peled them to belie and almost to forswear them- selves at every stage, or so misled them as to involve them in constant, flat, flagrant con- tradictions and misstatements-a supposition this latter, which, with Count Cavour's acuteness and fertility of resotrces, appears the less probable.
			But, when you have even proved that Napoleon was overbearing and Cavonr disingaenuous, men begin to asl-, What have you gained for Piedmnont and Italy 9 It was only yesterday a maDn in authority very deliberately saured me, "' The only friend the
			Italians have in France is the Emperor of thei French." Savoy and �ice, too, are utterly given up by an the European Powers, the only question likely to be brought before the Conference now about to open being that of the neutralized districts of Faucigny, Chablais, and Genevois, a matter of internationsl polity in which the national Parlia. mena may be said to be hardly concerned.
			Anything that may be said in the Miadamna or Carignano Palaces is, for all practicai uses, mere breath thrown away. But honour must also have its own path, and the example of the English Par- liament is a brilliant proof of the extent to which good men and true should take care "how they make themselves partakers of iniquity." No doubt prudent persons reflect how different is the position, and therefore the responsbility, of an orator of in- accessible no le3s than unconquerable England from that of a speaker in so helpless and deEenceless a State as Piedmont, EO helpless in its present tran. sitional and somewhat unsettled condition, so de- fenceless in its military and diplomatic position.
			Something yet, I am assured on all sides, will be said; the honour and digntity of the P?arliament will be saved; but Savoy, which the Italians would so much more wilinglyttpart with to Switzerland than to France-and Nice, which many of theim would die a thousnd deaths rather than give toany foreign Power-must not the less be immolated. Such ara the feelings with which hon. gentlemen take their seats in both Houses.
			The Chamber of Deputies assembled at 1 o'clock, and, as it was foreseen,was busywith the verification of powers, a mere formality, which resulted in . waste of precioustime and wasnothalf gonethrough. The House has been beautified, but scarcelv im- proved. The eye is pleased with the red velvet esats, green velvet tablecloths, and other ornaments, but room has only been made for the new members by opening into the hall some of the old tribune, or gallerieg and converting them into niches, the sit- ters in which will neither see nor hear, be seen nor be heard. The full-length portrait of Charles Albert, which hung behind the Presidents chair till last year has been removed, and the effigy of the present Sovereign has at last taken its place-an emblem rather of a new kingdom than of a newreign. Above the King's likeness, however, they have placed a large bas-relief in white marble, representing Charles Albert in the act of bestowing the Satutoo, or Constitutional Charter, upon his people. Among the conspicuous ornaments newly introduced I no- ticed all round the vast oval edifice, close under the vault, the coats of arms of the chief towns of the
			old and new dominions of the Royal house. Among them I saw the white crowned eagle and read the name of the city of Nice, and I thought, not with- out bitterness, that the same hands which so lately painted that symbol will Bo soon have to erase It. In the account of the results oe the various elections of the kingdom I was pecu- liarly struck with what was said about that same poor Nice. The first election, on the 25th of lMarch, proved a blank failure, because the Avenir and other papers in the French interest had announced that the annexation of the country to France wasa settled matter, and the election of members to the Pied- montese Parliament was therefore an idle ceremony. That announcement was, however, formally contra- dicted by an official proclamation, laying, as it were, the fate of Nice In the hands of its people by promismg an appeal to the public suffrage, and then, on the second election day, the 19th, the voters rushed to the polls in great numbers and re- turned Garibaldi by an almost complete unanimity. On that day Nice voted not only for the Genersl, but also for Italy. Garibaldi was in Turin to-day, and took his seat in the House. His fair or rather fox-coloured (fva7.) hair and complexion, and lion- like face presented a strange contrast to the milder countenances of the smug civilians around him. He professes to have come to do stout battle for his native city in the House, and combat the annexa- tion scheme by words, as he would be too happy to fight against it by might of arm. Would it were only of any avail !
			An unexpected melancholy incident came sud- denly to interrupt the sittIng. General Quaglia, the temporary President of the Chamber by right of age, broke down in a short speech in which he was putting one of the elections to the vote, and sank into the arms of some of the bystander, struck with a fit of apoplexy or paralysis, by which his life is even at this present moment endangered. He was removed to one of the anterooms and bled freely, but up to this present time (8 o'clock in the evening) little improvement is apparent. Alto- gether, the suddenness of the event and the ensuing dismay and consternation reminded me forcibly of the pictures I have seen of the death of Lord Chatham in the House of Lords. The sitting was adjourned instantly. General Quaglia is only 72 years old. The real Doycm of the Deputies, Jacopo Sanvitale, who is 74, yielded the honour which was due to him to the gallant veteran. The priestly party are already crowing about this acci- dent, in which they fancy they see the first effect of excommunication, and the work of " God's finger."
			A petition praying for the preservation of Nice as a member of the new Italian State is circulating at Genoa, and has already been covered with thousands of signatures.
			Generals Sonnaz and Menabre, distinguished Savoyard officers, have been plied by the Emperor Napoleon with the most tempting offers to induce them to enter the French service, but have firmly declined to quit their rank in the Sardinian army.
			The King's journey to Florence and Central italy is variously announced for the 16th, the 17th, and the 20th; 1 believe the latest is the most probable date.
			The Presidency of the Chamber will probably be conferred by the election of the Deputies upon Bnoncompagni, who filled that office for several years previous to his mission to Florence.

			NAPLES.
			(0noMr oUm ol coWvisPoN1OrDM.)
			NAPLES, MAncw S.
			If all the reports that one hears about Sicily have a moiety of truth in them, the state of that island is such as to awaken grave solicitude. In my last letter I toldyon that Prince Casteleicala had arrived in Naples with his family; and, though he may return for a time, I believe I may state that the Prince considers Sicily no longer a safe residenca for his sister and his daughter. It is said, too, that; many of the cmployis have sent up their families to Naples for similar reasons. I am not surprised at these apprehensions or precautions, for the Sicilians, like the Neapolitans, are bowed down to the ground by oppresslon, and, being more united than tho latter, are in a better state to resist, and stories have, long been circulating here that such a resistance is being organised. Indeed, the history of many months-nay, years-in that island has been a his- tory of discontents, struggles, outbreaks, and law- less acts of vengeance. f have heard from several independent sources that a packet of arms was found the other day in front of the palace hL Palermo with an inscription upon it to the following effect :-" Enough, and more than enough." Of course all official reports continue to state that the country enjoys the most profound tranquillity, but the tranquillity is that of the worm which is writh- ing under the heel of the strong man. The more recent reports state that the peasantry about Palermo had been disarmed, that the sale of salt- petre had been prohibited, and that gunpowder shops and magazines had been closed. On these re- ports you may depend, but the precautlone which are taken, while they show thee apprehensions which are entertained by the Government, will not defeat the object of the peoplek if they are resolved upon any movement. As to gunpowder, the Sicilians have abundant materialss and are well acqnainted w;ith the mode of making it. Before 1848 the manufacture and the sale of it; were not Government monopolies, and the Scihians have not lost the knowledge of an art which i5 likely to become so useful to them. Thus, to go no further back than the beginning of the reign of the "Dinexperienced" Sovereign who rules this country, we have not had one conciliatory act, but a series of irritatig and oppressive measures, which, have goaded the people into madness. If we retura to Naule, the report of what daily passes is pre-
			A list, on which I can depend now lies before moe of 07 persons impr3soned in Santa 3Iaria Apparento alone on political suspicion. Their names, su. names, country, date of arrest, occupation, and causes of arrest are all appended, so tihat I am in- viting your belief to no old wives' story. he oldest prisoner among them is 87 years of age, and waa arrested in 1850; nine were arrested in 1856, fivo in 1857, and the others at various tmes latr. Not one of them has been tried. For one year the Britich and French Blinisters have labonred for their liberation, but, instead of producing any cbange in their position, the number hs been from tia X
			tme Increased. Eight more persons are to be sent off in relegation to the island of Capri, I believe, this week, and in all probability a scene will be enacted imilar to the one I described in my last letter. By the by, it is currently stated that that disgraceful act was committed by Ajossa out of pique towarrda Mr. Elliott for having shown him up and destroyed his expectations by his able and manly correspondence. Indeed, few have any doubt that, had it not been for the untimely publication of that correspon- deace, the Director Ajossa would by this time have been gazetted as Minister. The public feeling against Ajossa isas strong as it can be wellimagined, and the surprise is not less Etrong that Prince Cas- saro, Prince Comitini, and Signor Gamboa, three really honest men, should have consented to en- danger their reputations by virtually sanctioning the illegalities and ferocities of the Directer of Police.a
			That there is a schism in the MEnist-yI have already informed you, but that fact by no means affects its existence, as the duty of a Neapolitan Minister is only to register and subscribe the orders "o of our Lord the King." Though, therefore, the members composing the 0Ministry may represent all the colours of the political rainbow, still they may go on opposing and neutralizing each other until it pleases His Majesty to remove them. There was a very pretty scene occurred in the Council a few days since. First, there was an angry discussion; then a tempest arose, and Signor Rosica, a man who in an age and a mass of corruption is marked for his honesty, thus addressedAjossa:-"God has notgiven you talent for the post which you occupy, and, while thinking that you do well, you are doing just the contrary, and increasing daily the enemies of the Government." The attack was made in the pre- senco of the King, but hitherto has produced no re- sults, for Ajossa flourishes, and his system is in vigour.
			The Giornale Ofliciale of last night publishes the name of Lieutenant-General Winspeare as Minister of War. Hitherto he was only gradutato MIinister, with 3,000 ducats annually; now he is full Minister, with 6,000 ducats a year. VPerhaps the reason of the change may be that he is out of bed, for 10 months a year are past by the head of the Neapo- litan army in bed. His Mylajesty very soon will, according to the custom of the Sipanish Bourbons, walki in procession to several churches on Holy Thursday to visit the sepulchres. I believe, how- ever, that arrangements are being made for the Court to leave Naples for Portici on Wednesday next, and that the pious duties of the week, such as washing the polished feet of 12 men bearing the sobriqTets of "Apostles," and other self-sacrificing offices. vrill be erformed at Portici
			Three Cabmet messengers-Castelli, Giannini, and Bezzi-left Naples with despatches last Satur- day, one directed to Turin, Paris, and London, nnother to ldunich and Berlin, and a third to Vienna and St. Petersburg. It is surmised that they ere the bearers of protests against the annexation of Tuscany and Parma, over which this family afiects to have some hereditary rights. Robert, the -Duke of Parma, is a Bourbon, and one of the titles of tho Monarch of this counry is Grand Dule of Tuscany. Protests are, however, but paper pel. lets now-a-days, and might weU hae been spared, especially in such a cause. It certainly would be no additional motive to the population3 of those I)uchies to return to their allegiance to their late Sovereigns that the Bourbons of Naples held certain reserved rights to the Sovereignty of thoso Statea. T see no disposition here to introduce the slightest c.hange in the government of the country, and, in fact, the beet that could be desired for this country Is an increase of excesses. MIere palllatives, temporary cessations from illegality and brutality, will prove only delusions. We must come to pr3n- ciples, and so long as the present dynasty ocoupies the throne of the Two Sicilies, the constitution, and that of 1848, is the only remedy for ills which 3nust continue so long as there are no checks on Eovereign caprice. I have said the constitution of 184S, because that is the " legal state," and has never been officially abolished, and because, as the granting of that constitution was doubtless commu- nicated to the several Governments of Europe, it is that Constitution which is recocniled by the Sove- reigns through their Minister. Of course, the Royalists say that the people are not ripe for such a measure, and so have they said since 1820, and so will they say to 1920, while they take not one single step, but just the contrary, to prepare them for the exercise of newprivileges. Yet Northern andCentral Italy and various other parts of Europe hold nearly 600 Neapolitan exiles, of whom a list of 200 or thereabout, distinguished by their talents lies before me. My list contains the names of 12 ex- MInisters, 32 ex-Deputies, 26 military men, 35 pro- fessors with degrees, 3 magistrates, 16 proprietors, 29 civil employes, and many of the nobility. Of course, it is possible to exhaust the wealth of a country, and then exclairn, " See how poor it is ," but the men awhose names I see before me are enriching and adorning otber part-s of Italy by their talents, and eome of them have been elected as Deputies to the new Italian Parhament. How much might they have contributed to the glories of their own country! Power is, however, very dear, and the stick and the dungeon will not willingly be abandoned as instru- ments of government. Since writing I have heard of more arrests, and among them of a lady. It is perfectly true that, as I assured you, not one, but several, if not all, of those who were " rdegati " to Capri the other day had their wrists bound so tight that the impression remained a long time after.
			I send you a list of the prisoners in Santa Maria pparcnte, upon vwhich you may depend. It may be worth publication, and if it be given to the world it will have an opuortunity of sceingin what manner justice is administered in this counatry_

			AUSTRIA.
			(FROM O1X. OWN CORIRPON1EN..)
			VIENNA, APIIL 4.
			AlthLough the Hllostein question is the greatest of political bores I must needs revert to it, in order that the British public may know what has led to the report that an offensive and defensive alliance is about to be concluded between France and Den- mark. Some months ago the Danish Government informed the German 'Diet that it was willing to appoint a committee,-to be composed of an equal number of Danes and Holsteiners,-whose duty it would be definitively to settle those questions on which the Government and the inhabitants of the Dachy have so long been at variance. On the receipt of this communication the Bund declared that it in principle approved the Danish project, but must recall to the memory of the Copenhagen Govern- ment certain binding promises respecting the Duchy of Schleswig whi.ch had been made to the Diet. A prolonged and auinaked correspondence ensued on the subject, and it ended by the Danish Govern- ment addressing notes to the British, French, Rus- sian, and United Statas' Governments, in which t complained of the tyrannical and aggressive con- dRuct of the German Bund. France thinks that Denmark has been hardly used, and the expression of that opinion must have led to the repo;t that an alliance is about to be concluded between the Paris and Copenhagen Govenments. The Elector of Hleasa is, as a matter of course, well satisfied with the decision of the Band in respect to the Consti- tution, but politicians of my acquaintance, who are well versed in German affairs, are inclined to fancy that the present system will not long be maintained in Germany. The Bund is now playing the game of the Empe:.or Napoleon, but there are indications that His Majesty wiU soon take the cards into his own hands. A German paper is about to appear at Strasburg, under the title of the German Corre&amp;pondent, and it is understood that its publishers will receive Instructions direct from Paris. From Carlsruhe we learn that the new Cabinet intends to settle the question respect- ing the relations between the State and the Roman Catholic Church in a constitutional way. The most important passage in the resolution recently taken by the Baden Diet in regard to the Concordat is the following:-
			" After mature consideration, the most faithful and obe- dien: (treutgdworsaraste) Sevond Chamber has como to the conclusion that the relations between the State and the Roman Catholo Church cannot be settled by means of a convention concluded without the consent of the Estates. The Chamber desires that the Roman CathoHc Church may enjoy all rights and privileges which are compatible with the well-being of the State; but, as the convention was con- cluded without the privacy and approval of the Diet, it IS bindin&amp; neither on the Grand Decal Government nor on the nation. The Chamber, therefore, humbly prays your Royal HIghness, in accordance with paragraph 67 of the Constitution, to revoke the ordinance of the 5th of Decem- ber, 1S59, relative to the Convention concluded with the Papal chair on the 28th of Tune, 1859."
			As several of the leating memberFs of the Wurtem- berg Diet were preserni in the Baden Chamber on the 29th and 30th of AMarch, it is to be foreseen that a vigorous attempt will be made to get rid of the Concordat which Baron von Ow concluded with, and at Rome, about two years ago. The whole affair was managed by Baron von Hiugel in an unconstita- tional way, but the old King did not interfere because he was unwilling to give pain to a certain lady who received from his Holiness a white rose (made of precious stones) as a reward for her impor- tant services. The hand of Austria is plainly to be scen in the Wurtemberg and Baden Concordats, for Baron von Hugel, the Wurtemberg Minister, is first cousin to Baron Charles Hugel, a well-known per- eonage, who was formerly Austrian Minister at Florence; and Baron Iivalier von Meysenbug, the Baden e-Mlinister, is the brother of the most in- fluential Aulic CounciDor in the Austrian Foreign- office.
			The object of the Emperor Napoleon in wishino to have a MEnisterial Conference for the settlemen't of the question relative3 to Chablais and Faucigny is very obvious. If a Conference should meet the French Monarch will play Jupiter, and magnani. mously give Chablais and Faucigny to Switzerland, if the Powers will recognize his right to the other parts of Savoy. At Berne it is affirmed that oll the Powers havo promised to lot Switzerland have the benefit of their good offices, but those of Austria and Russia will hardly be worth much. This Government must recently have tried to per-
			suade Prussia to guaranteo to it the possession of Venetia, for during the last week more than one of theBerlinpapers has declared itwould be " suicidal" should Prussia engage to do battle in defence of Venice. It is stated that France is endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation between Russia and Austria, in order that she may be able to come to an understanding with them in regard to the dismemberment of Turkey, but I am not inclined to attach any great importance to the report. About six weeks ago Prince Dolgo- rouiki was agitating in Servia7 but he was recalled by the Emperor Alexander, at the request of the Porte. Not long since it was proposed to hold a conference at Conatantinople for the regulation of Servian matters, but, for some reason or other, the Russian Government did not approve the project.
			The Oesterreichiische Zeitung to-day confirms the in- formation received from me, that the Neapolitan Government will not send any troops into 'the Papal States. The same paper says that the majority of the inhabitants of Venice are so vexed at being without theatrical performances that they are in- clined to make a demonstration against' the anti-Aus- trian party, but, of course, no one here gives credit to such news. A transport of some 50 persons, who have recently been arrested at Venice, is en- pected at Trieste. The ultimate destination of the unhappy men is not positively known, but they will probably be sent to a Slavonian or Bohemian for- tress. Among the persons arrested is a barrister, who in 1848 and 1849 was Minister of Police under Manin. MIany persons who were elected in Venetia as members of the "Terna," out of which two members of the Reichsrath are to ba chosen by the Emperor, have excused 'themselves on the plea that they are not acquainted with the German language. A few days ago the person who acted as director of the Austrian Commissariat at Milan durina the war was arrested at Oedenburg, in Hungary, and sent under escort to Verona. The retreat from Milan was so hurried that AI H- left behind him a strong-box, in which were 60,0001f., but it was not long ago remarked by the authorities that he bought a house at Oedenburg. It was at once suspected that the man had appro- priated to himself the 60,00011. which he pretended to have left at AIilan, and when he was taken into custody ready money amounting to more than 22,00011. was found in his possession.
			13y the balance-sheet of the Bank for the month of March we see that the State has given over to the Bank the Government and private stock balong- ing to the ci-derant ainkidg fund, so that the debt incurred during the war is reduced from 133,000,OOl. to 99,000,0Wdfi. The stock ceded for 34,000,000. v;as 9,500,000fl., in bonds, created for the indemnification of the landed proprietors (gmndentIastungs obligationen), 15,750,000ff. in pre- ference shares of the "Theiss-Bahn," 14,000,OfL in Galician Railroad shares, and 1,750,000. in Northern Railroad shares. At the general assembly of the Credit Bank, which was held this morning, it was announced that the shareho]ders would have a bonus of 2ff. per share, ia addition to the 5 per cent. interest which thoy received at the beginning of the year.
			The 1st Cavalry Corps, which may consist of some 16,000 men, is to be dissolved.
			Al. Geiza von Forinyak, the Pesth student, who was wounded on the 15th of March, died yesterday.

			BREISION OF THE LITURGY.
			TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Lord Ebury's main objection to the combination of our Church services, as now in general nee, seems to be the repetition of the Lord's Prayer and other prayers, 'I'he columns of such a leader of opinion as The Times are surely no inappropriate place to draw his attention, and that of others, reverently to consider the examplo of One who at this season " prayed the third time, saying the same words."
			Let those who clamour for revision of the authorized version of the New Testam ent, and of our venerable Liturgy, stady these gravo sabjects in the same spirit that Dean Trench has evinced in his work on the former of the two, and we shall cease to have periodical displays in Parliament on matters more suited for the closet than for even the Hlouse of Lords.
			I am. Sir, Yours. &amp;c..
			CLBRICUS.

			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Allow me one more letter in reference to our Church services. This day we have had our usual quantum of repe- tltions, aggravated by those of two additional collects, and where I have been by the entire absence of psalmody. This being holyday time, of course the boys are at home, and if I see them occasionally lolling when they ought to be kneel- ing, and staring into vacancy, or at the manmuvres of the school children, to kill the time, instead of being thoroughly attentive to the sacred and solemn service in which they are engaged, how can I chide them when I feel that It requires all my most strenuous ondeavoars-and those not always successful-to keep my mind from wandering under such a trial? It has been said that there is nothing to hinder the obviation of the greater part of the evils complained of by dividing the services, but, independent of the difference of opinion which we learn from high authorities in the upper House of Convocation exists as to the legality of such a procceding, an almost unbroken custom of something like S00 years Is against it, and has engendered habits among both clergy and laity which aro not easily disturbed,
			I have not tho least objection to a separation of the, sevices myself; far fromn it, but at least the legality of it should be placed beysnd a doubt so long as the " strait-waistcoat" imposed by the Act of Uniformity re- mains unloosed; and in a vast number of districts where the whole duty has to be done by a single clergyman, especially in the rural portions of the country, where the frequent collection of congregations is Impracticable, it is absolutely necessary that a certain fusion of the services, avoiding the repetitions, should be permitted.
			Another reason for my writing to you to-day is on ac- count ef the occasional want of congruity observable in our services, whlch I noticed in my last. To-day wo have Proper Psalms, but, for example, in this morning's servioe, why have we three? Surely the 22d Psalm would be quite sufficient of Itself, and, in fact, the effect of this wonderful prophecy is rather attenuated than strengthened by the ad- dition of the 40th and 54th, besides adding to the length of a service already more than sufficiently burdensome to a single clygyman not in robust health. I wll not enter into a discussion on the peculiarities of the G9th Psalm, but I should be happier if the 88th was alone used for the second service, at all events; there being daily proper services throughout the week treating of the great event which we specially commemorate to-day, it would be easy to place it and the other two at the disposal of the officiating minister.
			Allow me, in closing the subject for the present, to alude to tho article in the May number, 1859, of the Church of England monthly, from which I have already so largely quoted; for, although the writer does not desire so large an amount of alteration as I do most sincerely, for the sta- bility of our national church and the spread of our common Christianity,-though he holds me up as a warning and not an example, he yet handles the subject of what is called " Non-doctrinal revision" with an ability which carnot be surpassed, and I recommend it to the attentive perusal of aU whom it may concern,
			Lastly, I do earnestly supplicate the rulers of our Church to quit that obstructive position in which they are SO un
			happily placed, and to show themselves worthy of their high position in the confessedly difficult circumstances in whlch we are placed, entirely owing to that fatal procrastination which has prevented the previous settlement of those ques- tions, and which, if continued, wil cause them to become day by day more and more difficult of solutlon.
			Your obedient servant.
			EBUIRY.

			MILITAB Y AZD NA VAL INTEIGWNOB. I
			Major-Gen. D. A. Cameron, C.B., arrired at Edinburgh on Tuesday last, ard has succeeded. Major-Gen. Viscount Melville in the command of the forces in Scotland.
			The following circular memorandcm was issued on Satur- day last, addressed to the recruiting districts and army at home and abroad:-
			" lorse Guards, March 31.
			"His Royal Highness the General Commandinz in Chief, w iththe concurrenceof the Secretary of Statefor War,dlrects that the bounty for recruits, both of the Royal Artillery and the Line, be reduced to 21. andafree kit,which is tobe appro- nriated in the following manner, until further notice-viz., to the recruit, on being attested, in cash, 2s. 6d.; on final approval by the iaspecting field officer, in cash, 7s. 6d. on joining his corps, in cash, without deductions, 1Z. 165.; amount of bounty and a free kit of necessaries, 2/.
			" F:y command,
			" W. F. FORSTEB, Deputy Adjatant-General."
			Major-C-eo. Sir James Yorke Scarlett, K.C.B., arrived in town yesterday from Portsmouth, to enter upoa the duties of his office as Adjt.-Gen. of the Forces.
			Brevet-Lieut.-Col James Conunoly, Adjt.-Gen. of the Forces in Canada, will embark for that colony on the 18th inst.
			Intelligence having been received that the 31st (iuntIng- donshire) Regiment has been despatched from Poonah to China, orders have been received at the depbt, Chatham Garrison, for 102 non-commissioned officers and men to bo held in readiness to embark for China to reinforce the service companies. The subalterns ordered to embark with the reinforcements are-Ensign L Parsons and Ensign G. M. Lambert. The 31st depbt at Chatham is upwards of 300 strong, and recruits are still joining. The service com- panies have been in India since 153.
			The steam floating battery Trusty, 14, which has been towed Into Chatham Harbour, is intended to be taken into the first dock, recently vacated by the screw frigate Galatea, 26, in order to be carefully overhauled and put into a thorough state of repair, preparatory to a further series of experiments being triad upon her at Shoeburyness with the Whitworth and Armstrong long-range guns, under the direction of Colonel J. W. Mitchell, R.A., and the Ord nance Select Committee, consistlng of CoL J. St. George, C.B., R.A., President; Capt. Sir W. S. Wiseman, R.N.; CoL B. H. Greathed, C.B., D.C.L., B.A.; CoL W. J. Smythe, R.A.; and Col. W. Robinson, R.E. Since
			True l-rusty haS arrlved at Chatham she has been carefully surveyed by the principal officers of the Dockyard, In order to ascertain the entent of theinjuries sbe sustained on the occasion of tho former experiments made on her with the Armstrong gun at Shooburyness. The resalt ascertained is that her hull is very much injured in several places, tho elongated shots fired from the Armstrong gun being so terrific in their offeots as to shatter in pieces several of the massive wrought-iron plates with which tho battery is coated, and in some instances passing completely through the vesseL The whole of the Iron plates in the slightest degree injured are to be removed, and replaced by new ones of equal thickness; the timbers are also to bo re- paired, aud the recent damages made good with the least possible delay, when the battery wil be again towed down to Shoeburyness, and placed some miles out at sea, the Go- verrament being desirous of having a completo trial made of the rival Armstrong and Whitworth guns, when tho latter especially will be thoroughly tested.
			The Rodney, 91., line-of-battle scerw steamer, Is now en- tirely completed at Chatham Dockyard, and is waiting to be undocked, when she will proceed to join tho second divi- sion of the steam reserve in the Medway, under the com- mand of Captain Schomberg, supsrintendent of the reserve. According to present arrangements, the sailing frigato Aretbuca, 50, wil go into the dock vacated bytho Rodney, the Admiralty having ordered her to be lengthened and converted into a 51-gun steam frigate.
			Notwithstanding the large reduction ordered to be made at Chatham Dockyard by the discharge of upwards of 600 of the shipwrights, meohanies, and labourers who were taken on at that establishment during lost year, it is in- tended that about 1,000 of the hands then hired shall still be retained, and notice has been given to that effect. In tho mean timo a certain number of hands wil bedlsscharged every Saturday afternoon, untU the entire number ordered by the Admiralty shall have left the establishment. On Saturday afternoon 75 of the hired mechanics, shipwrights, and labourers received their discharge at the Dockyard gates.
			A.Court-martial, comprising Rear-Admiral John E. Erskine, commandlng the Port Division of the Chinnel Fleet at Spithead (President), Captains George T. Gordon, G. D. O'Callaghan, R. Harrls, It. S. Hewlett, C.B., C. F. Hillyar, W. Tarleton, C.B., T. Wilson, H. Caldwell, C.B., J. H. Strange, R. Coote, J. Eaton, and J. E. Vansittart, with MIr. W. F. Hellyer, Deputy-Judgo-Advocate assembled on board Her Majesty's ship Victory, on Satur- day, in Portsmouth harbour, for the trial of Lient. George S. Graves, late senior lieut. of lIer Majesty's brig Siren, on tho following charges, preferred by Commander George M. HBalfour, commanding the Siren:-
			" 1. That on or about the 18th of Juno, 1859, he, Lieut. Graves, did behave with contempt on tho quarter-deck of the Siren and use reproachful lanuage to Commander Bnafour, isis superior officer. 2. That he did onvarious occasions excite certain officers of the ship to act in opposi- tion and behavewith contempt to Commander Balfour, particularlyin two instances-saying to MAr. F. E. Evers. field, paymaster, ' I would not staud it, Evsrsfield, if I was you; 1 would wirite to the Commander-in-Chief,' &amp;C. ; also saying to Lient. Lewis, -eho had made a very proper explanation to Commander Baf our, ' You have eaten dirt,' or words to that effect. 3. That he did induce several seamene to desert from the Siren by saying, 'Why don't you run away?' and that ho did on one occasion say to a seaman of the Slren, ' Why the d- don't you ran away?' and that the said man did run away on the following day or thereabout. 4. That be did behave in a cruel and oppressive manner, and directly violate the Admiralty Circular No. 131, by causing two
			t fie to be lashed to spars or gratings on hoard the Sin durisg the absence of Commander Bafour. 5. That he did, in a letter dated on board the Siren at sea, on the 16th day of July, 1859, and addressed to Rear-Admiral Slr S. Lushington, E.C.B., the Commander-in-Chief, bring false and frivolcus charges against Commander Balfour.'
			At the commencement of the proceedings Commander Balfour, the prosecutor, handed in a letter to the Court, which was read, and In which he withdrew the fifth charge, In consequence of, the principal witnesses being absent from England. The prisoner then objected to the second, third, and fourth charges on account of their being contrary to the Queen's Regulations, which required the oharges to be substantially set forth. The charges gave no dates, and he bad in consequence been unable to prepare his defence to meet them. The Court then cleared to consider the prlsoner's objections, and on its belng re-opened an- nounced that they bad decided that the evidence on all the charges preferred by the prosecutor, with the exception of the fifth, which he had withdrawn, should be received. The whols of the witnesses for the prosecution were examined during the day. A condition ws Imposed on the reporters present, by the president of the-Court, that no evidence should bepablished until after the oenclusion of the case, one seriously affecting tho dlscipline of Her Majesty's ships. At the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution the Court was adjourned unti 9 a.m. this day to enable the pri- soner to prepare his defence.

			Eighty-four artisans and others were discharged from the dockyard at Devonport on Saturday.
			An attempt will be made to-morrow (Tuesday) evening by Mr. William Orchard, of the rigging departmens in Her Majesty's dockyard, Devonport, to raise and float off from Batten Reef, in Plymouth Sound, the stranded transport Havering. She went ashore on Saturday, March 31, ever since which time hcr cargo has been discharging. It con- slsts of shot, shell, gunpowder, provisions, preserved meats, ale, porter, bread, medical stores, clothing, bedding, tents, &amp;c., and aboutl50 tons British merchandise onprivatefreight. A very largo portion has been removed, and there are not more than 150 tons deadweight left, exclusivo of 30 tons of gunpowder, the rest being what is termed "flotable." The Havering registers 912 tons and draws, when laden, nearly 20 feet; she lies stern on to the Batten, her bow being nearly due west. Early last week, the tide being quarter ebb, the depth of water alongside at midships was 22 feet, and astern 21 feet. The Admiralty will lend four brig hulks from Dovonport of about 400 tons each, which will be provlded with powerful pur- chases in the shape of three-fold blocks. The lifting power is calculated at 600 tons. Altogether 200 fathoms of 2. inch cablo chain wilU be used, and eight jewel rings of 4k inches for slinging. Tho appliances are furnished with the understanding that all damages are to be repalred. Should Mr. Orchard be successful in floating her off, two merchant tugs will be In attendance to convey her to somo place convenient for repair, possibly near the commercial

			APPREHENSION OF HEENAN.
			On Thursday information was sent to the chief constable of Leicestershire, who had previously put himself in com- munnication with the Midland Railway Company on the subject, that Heenan, who was about to fight a prize battle with Sayers, might be heard of at the Treot Locks, Long Eaton, Derbyshire. Ho immediately de. spatched Detective-Sergeant Clarke, of the Leioestershire constabulary, to Darby, who communicated with the con- stabulary authorities of that county, and after ascert3ining that Heenan was training at a publichonse at Lon.g Eaton, he, with Superintendent Shaw, of the Derbyshire con- stabudary, obtained a warrant and watched the house all night, and on Friday succeeded in apprehending Heenan, after an ineffectual attempt on his part to escape by a bawk window of the house in vhich he had taken refuge.
			On Saturday morning Heenan was brought up before Dr. Heygate at Derby. He was represented by Mr. S. Leech, from the office of Mr. Gamble. There were also several of his friends present, who had arrived that morning by mail train from London.
			Mr. lhiston,maglstrates' clerk, addrensing Heenam, said -You, John Heenan, are brought here on the information of John Shaw, who says from information he has received -namely, that a prize fght is likely to take place in the connty of Derby, between Thomas Sayers and John Heenan and that a riot is likely to occur in the said county,-he re- quires that the rsad John ifHeenan, who is now residing at Long Eaton, in the said county, may be required to find sureties for good behaviour and for the preservation of the publicpeace for six months.
			Ar. Leech, addressing Dr. Heygate, said he appeared on the part of Heenan, having been requested to do so by several gentlemen of the town. He (Eeenan) rquested him to state that he had never bro-en the peace in this coanty, and had no intentian of so doing. It was true he might have made nse of some harsh language, but it was done in the excitement of his capture, when hi passions would naturally be aroused. But when they considered that he had been
			"hunted," as it were, out of eight counties, and that his op- ponent, Sayers, was a'lowed to go on with the greatest im- punity, ho did feel sore at the treatment he was receiving. If at any time he had made use of expres- sons that he ought not to have done, he was very sonry for ft. Two respectable gentlemen of the town were present to give bail for his good behaviouir, end It woud be for the magistrates to f�x the amount. The amount WaS always guided by the station in life of the persona called upon to nind it, and he begged to inform the Bench that in America Heenan carried on the trade of a blacksmith. HEo hoped the Bench would not assess the bail at a large amount.
			Ar. Whiston, magistrates? clerk, said the Bench had agreed to take Heenan's own recognizance of 501., and two sureties of 251. each. He would also add that the authori- ties had no feoling in the matter beyond the preservatlon of the public. peace.
			The eicestershire Inspector of Police said he wished Heenan to understand that if ho or Sayers came into his county and broke the peace, they would be taken.
			Mr. Fox, chief constable.-lt extends to every county in England.
			Mr. Leech.-Bnt they cannot now interfere with Mr Heenan in any county, unless ho should break the peace.
			The suretles were then signed, and Heenan left the court with his frlends.
			A great crowd assembled outslde the hail and remained there for several hours. Heenan was quietly taken the back way, through Mr. Hilton's house, and, a cab being in readi- ness, he drove off with his friends, intending to leave for london by the next train.
			Captain Foster, chief constable of the se of Ely, in an official report to the quarter sessions, states:
			H "lvaving received Infonatlon that a e m OrbS was absut to take place la the Isis of Ely I made application to tho bltUlsey beach, with the view to have the Intended combatants heard over to keep the Dpeac. Tho wasrants were granted. One saperlotendmt " de7he'

			SPOBTLNG IYTBLEIGBNO.
			This week the race-loving population throuzghou;t the country will be provlded vith ample opportunitie. for the gratification of their tastes. Tho first of the series of New- market meetlns wMil commenco this day; In Yorkshire races will tako placo at Catterick-bridge on wednesday and Thursday, and at Thirske on Friday and Saturday. Theso aro the most Important gatherings, andto which the betting fraternity will attach the most interest. Bait several pro. grammes of minor meetings have also been issued, and In their respective localities they excto considerablo expecta- tion.
			People anticipate the Craven meeting with much curiosity for apart from the interesting quality of the sport they will watch with peculiar anxiety the movements which are likely to be made in the turf market with reference to the Two Thousand Guinea Stal-es and the Derby. For many years, too, the Nevwmarket season has never commenced undermeore favourable auspices. The Jockey Club have patinto executionmany judidous measuresof reformn,andby effecting improvements on the Heath and strengtheningtheir lists of sport tbey have obtained for Newsmarket a new icaso of popularity. The annual general meeting of the club wlll take placoe on Wedneuday, when, in addition to the trans- action of the ordinary routine business, a probabillty exists that some attention will be bestowed on the claues con. tained in Lord Redesdale's Heavy-welght Bil, and that the club themselves wil fix the scale of weights to be adopted by handicappers. In order to ascertain the results of the deliberations of the Jockey Club Lord Redesdale has de- ferred moving the second reading of his BiU untU after the first Newmarket meetings, stating that he wishes every opportunity may be afforded the club to &amp;discs the subject [and express their opinion as to the proper liimls. ", I acknowledge," writes his Lordship, " the huigh authority they may j ustly claim in such matters, and anxiously desire to secure their approval and co-operation."
			There will he a ballot for new members of thie Jockey Club, the candidates being his Grace the flk- of Rutland, the Earl of Anneslev, MIr. Caledon Alexander, ani Mr. Cbarles Towneley, of Towneley-hall, Lancashire
			The town is rapidly filling with visitors. The Earl and Countess of Stamford, who arrived on Thursday, have hired for the season the house formerly orcuDied by the late General Auson; and Earl Fitzwillism, w ho ,will be accom- panied by the Countess1 has also rented a house.
			The H eath end exeresse grounds wvere never in better con- dition. They have an exceLlent covering of herbage, and are q,uite elastic to the tread. The extension of the wires of the Blectric Telegraph Cempany to the new Stand on the Flat will afford a great gcgomnmodation to the visitors, who
			nave song compiasnea or tne want ot lacilatles for the recep- tion and transmission of messages from the Reath,, while at the same time it will stop that reckless riding into the town by messengers, who in their seed and their rivalry fre- quexitly aced in jeopardy thoilivos and limbs of women and chUdren. The uistakes, too, whlih were made by the clnmsy mode of signaling tho winner's numbers will, thanke to the arrangement j ust made, be entirely obviated.
			Thirty-eight items are distribated over the programmes for the five days.
			Kinig of Diamonds, who has been somiewhat heavily hacked for the Two Thousand, hut who is now usnder sus- picion for that event Is enga-ed in the Bennington Stake, for whtch, hdwever, should h'start, he is not lkely to meet any opponent of very great racing ability. Hij s1 Two Thonsandi" supporters will evince much anxiety to sDe him. Ameog the nominations for the swreepstakes of 50 sovs.
			whose de~biU, from the fact of binsabngfequently igred so cially as in Swveetsauce, Cavrian3, Apollyon, and Pa;efao
			to each of wvhom bo will have to concede 4ib., ho wUi meet animals of some little pretension to racig merit. A match three unclosed stakes, and sweep.takes, for which are entered Fravols, the winner of Earl Spenoer's Plate at
			plete the first day's list. i
			Theosport on Tuesday will be very abundant and very interestmng, for in addition to the Handicap for which It i9 expected that about 20 horses will ho sent to the post, twe Biennial Stakes have to be decided. Already much betting bee taken place on the Randia,adadtonal spilit is yet lkLely to be imparted to spculatioon the event, the imposts having been distributed with that care andsiopartialityowhich mark al similar works issuedby Admiral Ron9, who, however, by fixing bin mnimumb weight at 4st. lib., has given a practical opposition to the theory propounded by Lord Bedeodale. The field iD likely to com- prise soveral good horses, inclading the winner of last year'6 St. aeger, the winner of the Iorthamptonshire Stakes, and several other animals that have obtined distinction by tho supenonty of their perFormances. The French turf wll be represented by Matlelsoltse do Chantliwy and the American by Desdemona r late Des Cfd es), who, although bred in the United States, is nowb the property of an English gentlemen.
			Most of the 4-yr-olds nominated for the First Biennial Stakes having been " rim through" Last season, and many ethers having broken down, the event is likely to com- of note in the list are Marionet, who whash s geodfrr TIrumpeter, who was third, end who broke down in his effort to obtain that position for the Derby, and Volatile. The starters it wouldl be diffcult to indicate, for, as we have alre ady stated, a large majority of the horses nomi- nated are inferior. The Biennial Stakes, for 3-yr-olds, will occasion the most interesting, and perhaps tho most Im- portent race of the week. Among the horses entered for it are the American Derby colt Umpire, Plum-Pudding Brother to Rlainbow, Lupollus, Buccaneer, and King od Diamonds. It is more than doubtful whether Umpire wil be brought out, and the extraordinary movement relative to Buccaneer for the Two Thousand will prepare the poblie for his withdrawal from his engagements, but the appear- ance of his stable companion Plum-Paddlng in the lists wMil cause deep interest, and his ranning wiU materially affect the Two Xhousand betting. At any rtate It will go far to resolve the doubts which exist relative to the merits of the two horses.
			Thormanby, aTnother Dorby horse, is engaged in a swveep. etalkes with Restes and two otbers, andl. no sinister reports have beencirculate~drespectlinghim, his reappearance in pub- lic will be Bnxlouslv watched. The list feoar Wednesay is at present somewhat barren ot interest. On Thursday Rich- mond and 1'lumn-Pdding are engaged in the Hurstbomrno Stae (Va new race), and The Promised Land and North Lincon may ho pitted against each other for the Clart Stalkes. Thormanby baEi two enga-ements for Friday, for which day the supply of sport wiYl be scanty enough to allow of the despatch of the "spacial" by an early hour in the afternoon.

			THE Emsnrroix MIcuDER.-An adjourned inquest was held on Wednesday afternoon at Becklhouse, before Dr. Henry Bell, of Cockermouth, respecting the death of Ann Sewell, aged 24, a servantmaid to Mr. Fearon, farmer. Becl-house is a small group of houses, surrounded by meadows and surmounted by fells, in the valo of Euibleton, a short distance from the Cockermouth main road, and near Bassenthwaite Lake. Dr. Dodgson, of Cocker- mouth, stated that, in conjunction with Dr. William- son, he had made a post mortcms examination of the deceased. He found in the upper part of tho left side of the neck a deep wound about seven inches in length, commencing about an inch in front of the spinons processcs, and extending to within an inch and a half of the centre ol the chin. The muscles and soft parts were cat through, the carotid artery was nearly 60, and the spInal cord was stvered. After a minnte description of the character of the vound, the witness added that Its lower lip was jagged, appearing as if it had been cut at least three times. Besides the prin- cipal wound there was another superficial one a little helov, near the front of the neol, and a slight cut on the lower lip. There were also injuries on both hands. The middle finger of the right hand, which waa partially closed, was cut, and the fingers end thumb, and back of the left band, which was rigid, were much lacerated. On the rIght hip there was a circular bruisoubont two inches
			in diaeter, ane a ELnuar one on tiie lett forearm. A]l the wounds might have been idictd by the lnifo discovered in deceased's hand, but it was -m. possible that a person committng self-destruction could Gntirely cut through the spinal marrovr. Death must have been instantaneous if the spinal marrow had been cut through with the knife in question, and the deceased would have no power left to grasp the weapon. He did not belleve It possible that she could have delsroyed herself. The knife was here prodaced; it is a common tableknife, with a dark bone handle. There are some staeu of blood on the blade. Fourteen other witnesses were ems- mined, but their evidence did not disclose any conclusivo facts in addition to those already stated, and tho inquest
			was again adjourned.

			TuE OCEAN TMAIL SERvicE.-Southampton, April 7th.-The Peninaular and Oriental Company's screw steam- Bhip Behar, Captain J. C. Almond, sailed to-day with the Peninulfar ma.ida fair number of passengers (including Mr.
			Captain T. Black, left the doek9is trhtissi' mormnmandwend to wtohe tahe where she ran the measured mile four times,

			THE F.TAL AccsiDENT iN HASOVEP-SQUARE.- On Satnrday an inquiry was instituted by Mr. Bedford, the coroner for West Middlesex, at St. George's Hospital, into the circumstances attending the death of Jobn Brightinan, a house lairter. who died on Tuesday last from the effect of injuries resulting from the falling of a scaffold erected at No. 22, Hanover-squtare, en which the deceased was standing.
			f. l'ernaU deposed that he saw the deceased and two other men fall from the sc.alold,and assisted in conveying them to the hospital. The scaffold-nole which broke was in an hori.
			zontal vnsitlon, and was about five inches thick. William lleilicin stated that he saw the scaffold-pole which had broken lying where it fell; it appeared to be much decayed, and seemed as if it had been previously broken or cracked and a nail had been driven thro3-h the cracked portion to strengthen it. The pois was bro;cen about half-way ecress. MWr. Ceorge Hiarrison, amssistant-house-surgeon at St. George's llospita:, stated he sa.v deceeased abont an hour .fter hls admission into the hospital. Ho had a scalp wound upon the rIght temple into which hs could put hia finger and feel the loose portions of bone. ligatunre was fastened round n vessel which had been bleeding. There was also a scalp wound on the posterior part of the head. The man wvas unconscious, and remained in that state for about three liours, when he died. Death re- sulted from Injury to the brain. *r. Mstolloy, labourer. stated he assisted in the erection of the scaffold. Did no' have anv Instructions given him as to the mode of building it. Tbis was left to his own judgment. Did not know he was going to work on the scaffold hiniself. The poles and timber used wera taken from Hr. Fosley's yard. They were taken Indiscriminately. Mlr. Fo3ley had been himself to see them while they were erectinc the scaftold, and told thetn to bo very careful. Patrick Moran, the other labonrer who assisted in building the scaffold gave evidence to a similar effect. The nob through the breakage of which the accident occurred is t.hen examined by the jury. It was In a n-e!y decayed condition, and evidently unfit for the pur. pOse to whtch it had been devoted. Mr. Fosley examined, m1d he was a builder. He had told the men to be careful. Did not know he had such a polo on his premi-es uas Vhe one
			resented , if he had known it would not have allowed It to
			eused. Thc polo' was quite strong anm stout enough if it had. been sound. He very mruh regretted the accident, which had deprived him of an old and faithful servan:. The jury rcturned a verdict " That the deceased dlcd fro2u the falling of a scaffold in comequenco of unsound ma:erials baving been used."

			THB SUBMARIBE TELEGBAPh TO
			GIBRALTAR.
			The unfortunate failure of the AtlanticTelegraph, -with its long serlesof mistakes and ,iscalculations, has exercised, and still to a certain extent continues to exercise, a de- pressing influence upon all important schemes for sub. marine telegraphic communication. We can scarcely say that confidence in the worLing practicability of any Atlantic telegraph 'whatever, submerged alorg the old deep sea route, has yet been established, while, re- garding such a scheme merely in the light of an investment -a commercial speculation by which money is to be made, we need not remark how, at the present time, even the best inaugurated enterprise of ;he kind vwould soon have the grief of seeing its shares at half discount unless the most rigid and practised caution wae exercised both in the choice of route and choice of cable. In the meantime, during the stagrnation that has engulfed all such projected schemes since the Atlantic cable was designed and lost, a great reforma in the method of ccastracting submarine ropes has been going steadily forwa:d. The old self-destructive principle of ponderous iron coils for deep sea wires has been so generally abandoned, that a proposition for now re- verting to their use across a sea of any length or depth would not be entertained for a moment by telegraphic engineers. To be sure, this change, which of conrse was, and stlU ig, fiercely oppesed by some of the wize rope- makers, has not been brought about til the credulity and patience of shareholders were at an end, and until the bottom of the Mediterranean, and other seas, had been fruitlessly adorned with threa or four of those leviathan coils, endtring monuments of our commercial enterprise and of our mechanical igncrance also. This journal was neither slow nor lukewasm from the first in point- ing out the inherenb faults of construction which led to this fearful waste of money, and- tili worse-which gave rise to fears In the public mind that long lines of sub- marine telegraphs presented insuperable difficalties. Onr columnu at the same period also bear testimony in many letter3 from electricians and eagineers that some who are now most forward in supporting the princigle of compara. tively light cables were then most strenuously opposed
			to them, and most urgent int denouncing the advocacY of Vie Times in their behalf. Since that period -only four years ago, though marking an age in the infant science of telegraphy-opinions have undergone a most im. portant change, and both contractors and engineers now often lean so strongly to very light cables that the idea, like al good ideas, Is in danger of being led into extremes, and we may see as much public money lost in trying to submerge cobwebs as was ever dragged down -" fathoms deep," even by those expensive wire-covered cables, big enough and heavy enough to moor an island. The re- sults of this great alteration in the weight and strength of cables are likely soon to be practicaly tested on the most extensive scale, by the proportionate saccess, or non-success, of some cables which are now being manufactured in England. One is about the very lightest cable of its kind that has ever been made at all, always excepting the guttapercha-covered copper wire which was stretched across the Black Sea to Balaclava. The other is to be a well-proportioned " composite" cable, heavy and verymassive,perhaps far too much so insome parts; in others, where it is proposed to be sunk some three miles down, it is. if not quite a light rope, still, with regard to lightness, an important example in the right direction.
			The first-mentioned extremely light cable, which will weigh less than 3cwt. per mUe in water, is about being constructed at the Electric Cable Company's works, Mlwa3L The heavier, and we mast also say the more expensively pro. portloned, rope is in progress of manufacture at Glass and Elliot's for the English Government, and will, it is hoped, before next winter unite this country with Gibraltar. Those, however, who suppose that the question of the rela- tive merits of a medium light cable or one of the lightest possible construction will be entirely set at rest by the nltl- mate success or faUiLre of either of these two kinds of rope will be mistaken, lnasmuch as the contract price allowed for the very light cable we hav- mentioned is not, we imagine, sufficiently high to insure the pro- duction of the best article oi its kind. On the other hand, with the cabletoGibraltar,all questions of costhavebeen con- sidered at the Treasury as entirely subordinate to procuring the very best workmanship and material-the highest con- ditions of mechanical and electrical excellence which it is possible to secure by money, toll, or ingenuity. Both these cables, nevertheless, mark important epochs in the quick progress of ocean telegraphy, and as their success-though one is removed from the ordinary limits which govern commercial enterprise-is Eikely to influence in the most important decree the construction of all future cables, we shall take occasion to give our readers some Insight into their chief peculiarities. None will require to be told that for this country it is a matterof thevery last insportance that the Government should have the means of as instantaneous commnunication with Malta and Gibraltar as they have now with Wool- wich or Portsmouth. In fact, it seems somewhat Astonish- ing that England, which has manufactured thousands of mUes of cables for every other em pire, should etiU be entirely dependent on Continental overland and sub-
			marine lines for a means of communication with the very centres of its European power. Before next winter there- fore, we may hope to see the first steps taken towards putting an end to this very unsatisfactory state of things, and a working telegraph laid from England to Gibraltar. Beforo next year Is out, if the first lino ts successful, a similar cable will unite Gibraltar with Malta, while befoTe the close of 1862 the line from the latter island to Alexandria, and so on, rid Suez and the Red Sea, to India ought to be complete, taking it for granted that theoRed Sea line con- tinues in good working order.
			The direct route from this oountry to Gibraltar would for the most part lie through what in telegraphic works would be caUed deep water-the route from Brest to Finisterre, and so on round the coast of Portugal, at a comparatively short distanco from land, averagiong on the wholo either 1,000 or more than 1,000 fathoms. But in this cable (as should have been the case with every one that has ever been made) the contract 'with Glass and Elliot is not only for its manufacture on a certain plan but for sabmerging it suc- cessfully. The depth of water in which it will ultimately be laid will, therefore, doubtless rest In a great measure with the contractors, subject of course to certain conditions of the Government that it shaU be sunk in water deep enough to keep it out of the reach of any enemy either to ralse or to break. The latter considerationr s, of course, one of the last importance, sinco only in war time will attempts be mado to injure it, and In war time, above aU others, its services would bo absolutely indis- pensanie to the country. It is in reference to the security of the rope from injury that some uncertainty, we are sorry to say, still exists, as to the best of two places for landing the cable here-Falmouth or the coast of Ireland. In case of the former being chosen the route must take from this countrv a south-wcsterly course, in order to givo a wide berth to B:est and Cherbourg, where the water shaUows to SO or 100 fathoms, and In which an enemy's frigate properly provided with grappling irons could either raise or break the wire at a day's notice. After passing Brest, however, the rope can always be kept in deep soundings of from 500 to 600 fathoms, except for about 300 miles across the centre of the Bay of Biscay to Finist'erre, where the greatest depth Is nearly 2,700 fathoms, and where at no part for a length of 270 miles is there les3 than 2,500. From Finisterre, which is almost precisely midway between this country and Gibral- tar, tho contractors can chooso their own depth, and, we need scarcely add, it is to be hoped that the Government will take care that they place their cable where neitherfriend nor enemy can ever reach it. The great and almost fatal objectlon to this route, of course is, that after leavingFalmouth the wire must remain for a length of nearly 300 niiles in a depth of water nowhere exceeding 200 fathoms, and generally very cousiderably less. All telegraph engineers know that at this distance from the surface any cable, no matter what its thickness, can be either raised or broken-witness the recent fracture by an empty Indiaman of one of the thickest cables, nmado by Glass and Eliot, between this country and HIolland. By starting from Ireland, on the contrary, two or three miles fromi shore at once puts the cable into from 300 to 500 fathoms of water, a [depth at 'which It would be most difficult to find
			any wire whatever, no matter what its size. There must always be some risk of its being found by an enemy keeping close in shore. NlaturaUy the best plan, therefore, is to submerge it along that route where its chances of discovery are the least. In short, there is no valiid reason 'why the cable should bo landed at 3al- mouth in preference to any other place, while, on the other hand, the reasons for its being brought to Ireland are so strong as to make it alnos' a necessary measure of precaution.
			Before tho form, weight, strengtb, and outer cover
			ing of each portion of the cable were resolved on, the Board of Trade took the utmost pains, by consult- ing our chief electricians, to ascertain the kinds best suited for the purpose and for long endurance under water. Researches into these mattors have led to the adoption of a cable of different thicknesses, I weights, and strengths, according as the depths of the waor under which it wil be laid increases-thewhole forming one continued submarine rope, which, if not per. fec' in its muechanical arrangement, is nevertheless one which holds out high prospects of ultimate nUC- cess. The coro or conductor is, of course, of the same thickness and formation throughout from end to end, beinig formed of seven No. 1S copper 'wires, in all
			about one-eighth of an inch diameter-the thickest con- I ductor that has ever yet been made. The copper l strands of this, in accordance with the advice of theelee tricians, have been very carefauly selected and tested for conducting power, as even the purest copper wire, from some unknown cause, has been fonnd to vary In electrical conducting power as much as 40 per cent. Its power of
			conducting heat also diminishes or increases in the same i proportion with its electrical sensitiveness. Yet, though the conductor with its insulating medium of gutta- percha ia alike in diameter throughout, the manner in which this core is protected, or we had better say the thickness to which the outer covering is l:id on, differs considerably. Thus, each oE the two shore ends is made to rest in from 100 to 2W0 fathoms, and these for 30 knots each way are very massive, at the rate in weigh' of seven tons to the mile. The next length at each end is also of 30 knots, and will rest in from 200 to 400 fathoms water, and is for this depth a very massive cable, weighing about five tons to the mile. By the sub- stitution of a finer gauge of wire at each two or three miles or so, this gradually tapers down to meet the first deep sea length, which will be laid in from 500 to 800, or, possibly, even 1,000 fathoms. The length of this portion of the cable, is 940 nautical miles, its weight in air two tons per mnie, in water about 34 cv;t. The deepest deep-sea portion across tho centre of the Bay of Biscay extends over about 280 knots, though 360 knots are being manufactured to meet contin- gencies in submerging. Here the depth averages about 2,500 fathoms, equal to the very deepest parts of the cable plateau of the North Atlantic. To overcome the difficulties of this vast depth of water the cable is strengthened by the introduction of steel wire in its outer covering, and reduced toweigh in air only 26 cwt., in water aslow as 13. The weight of the Atlantic cable in air was one ton, and in water about 15 or 16 cwt., per mile.
			The different weights of the different parts of the cable are, of course, entirely due to the thickness of the outer spiral wires wvith which it is covered. The con- ductor, with its threefold insulation of gutta percha and Chatterton's patent,-which latter, by the way, is not equal to an additional fold of gotta percha,-is all served round alike with yarns of tarred hemp closely
			bound in, and over which come the outer wires of various gauges, No. 1 gauge, the thickest known, being as thick as a cedar pencil, and so on up to No. 45 gauge, as fine as cotton. The two heaviest shoreends, then, of 30 miles each, are covered with 12 No. 3 gauge wires, which brings its weight up to seven tons a-mile, and its breaking strain from 25 to 30 tons. The second land ends are enclosed In 12 No. 5 gauge wlres, of five tons to the mile, and equal to about 15 tons' strain.
			The first deep-sea length of 950 miles for from 500 to S00 fathoms is closely covered, like the Atlantic, with 18 No. 11 gauge solid iron wires, weighing two tons the mile In air, 33 cwt. in water, and equal to a strain of nearly eight tons. The deepest sea part is enclosed in 12 steel wires of No. 14. gauge, each wire being spun roandand enclosed in a separate strand of hemp, in order,if possible, to tako offtbat dangerous springiness end tendency to kinkc, which makes all steel wire rope, even when coiled, so lively, and so much re- sembling a cargo of live eels. The cable, the chief points of which we have thus described, is necessarily a most expen- sive one, for, as we have already stated, the Government have contracted that aU parts of the material and work- manship are to be of the 6nest possible kind.
			Nevertheless, in spite of all the care that has been taken to securo a good rope, and the improvement which, with regard to strength witb a certain amount of lightness, the deep-sea portion of this cable un- doubtedly displays, It is still, we aore sorry to say, con- structed on the old self-destructive principle of spiral iron wires round a soft core-one of tho most faulty mechanical arrangements that could have been attempted. There is not a single engineer of eminence who does not condemn the principle of layinig on the outside wires spirally, instead of longitudilnally, in a line with the strain they have to resist. Why the old arrange- ment is persisted In at the present day it is difficult to imagine, unless it is due to the fact that most of the wire-rope manufacturers have their machines con structed for laying on the wires spirally, and do not care to make others which wiU render tho completion of their work slower, more difficult, and less profitable. Four years ago, when the plan of construction of the Atlantic cable was resolved on, we most strongly deprecated this arrangement, and the event has so clearly justified what we then pointed out would bo the consequences, that we maybe excused for quoting the opinion on the present occa- slon:-
			" Whenevera cable is constructed wit'n spiral wiresround a soft core any severe strain in paying it out must, by stretching the outside wires, either attenuate or break the insulation of the copper conductor. This is a simple fact which those least conversant with mechanics can easily understand. We do not mean to say that the Atlantic cable cannot succeed, but the chances are very much against it, and it is certain that before It has been down 12 months it will, like most others similarly constructed, be perfectly useless. If it does answer even temporarily, it wiU not be due to the plan on which it is made, but in spite of it."
			We shbaU on another occaslon inform our readera of the chief principles on which the light cable before men- tioned is being constructed, end the prospects which cables of that description hold out of being successful when laid. All that we have at present to add with regard to the Gibraltar cable is that the contractors undertake to submerge it at their own risk and expense; and, to insure proper fulfilment of this portion of their task, the Govern. ment very wisely retain 5 per cent. of the price of tho whole cable (which is In aU nearly 300,0001.) In their own hand-
			and further compel Messrs. Glass and 5iuot to give security to the amount of 20,0001. that the rope shaU be successfully laid. Itis proposed to submerge it in two equal portions -one from Gibraltar to Cape Finlsterre, and one from Finisterre to (we hope) the south-west coast of Ireland. It is anticipated that the whole rope will be ready for laying about the middle of September next.

			Tsra MvsuinDs 03r ThE fcUs SEAS.-It WMl be remembered by the pubilo that at tho October sessions of the Central Criminal Court a seaman named Charles Annois, a native of Rioa de Janeiro, Was COnvicted Of a mur- der of a very horrible character orn board an English chip, and was eft for execution. The murder was committed under very extraordinary circumstances. The prisoner -hipped as cook on hoard the vessel in questionl 'at Lisbon, and for Eeveral dag,s be conducted himself very well, nnd indeed ho had made himself rather a favourite with the captain of the vessel, whos3 life he afterwards destroyed. The murder was committed in the dead of the night when a portion of the crewv had turned in, and the remainder were eng-aged in watching on deck. It appeared that thu prisoner went into the captain's
			cabin, and nearly severed his head from his body with a* large cleam-knife. After the commisson of the act he appeared in a frantic state of excitement, and he se- verely wounded one or two of the crew before he could be finally secured, when he wvas placedl in irons and brought to England to take his trial, The defence that wa sSet up for himn by his counsel was, that at the time the act was committed the prisoner was not in a state of mind to he responsible for hiis actions; but it. appenred by the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution that the prisoner had not either before or after the transactien exhiite th slihtet smptm ofinsnit, ad that he cnvered prfecly rtionlly ftertheoaccurrence. The ury upn thse ast, aler god deal of delibera-
			reiolt foun the prSenerdaiy oftwlflmudr,adnh Modaywa fixed for the execuxtion. The r otgus geti
			maen to the Home. Secetaryuto obtain eree n h
			was sae all opportunity might be afforded for tho production of evidence from Rio do Janeiro, of which place the prisoner is a native, to show that his mind had been pieviously affected. It seems that there was a good deal of delay In making the necesary inquiries, and the re- suit was that two other respites were sent for the prisoner but each time with an intwmhtion, wihch WaS car=ully ex- plained to him in his own language, in order that he might not be under any misapprehension upon so fearful a matter, that the respite was merely given to afford further time for inquiry, and that he must not consider thab it indicated an intention on the past of the authorities that the capital sentence would not be carried out; but that, on the con- trary, If the result of the Inquiries that were being made aid not clearly esablish the suggestion that had been made with regard to the state of his mind, the capital sentence would still be carried out. The prisoner has behaved re- markably well since be has been in Newgate, and he is con- stantly visited by a Roman Catholic priest, who is allowed to have free access to him. He has repeatedly declared that he never entertained the slightest illwill to the unfortunate deceased, and he has also stated on several occa- sions that he has no recollection of any of the circurmstances connected with the fatal deed; but at the same time says that he is quite prepared to die. The last reprieve that was sent for the prisoner re- spited the day of execution to the 26th of April. It ap- pears from inquiries made of the Secretary of State bv the
			rison anthorlties that no information has yet been received from abroad respecting the prisoner, and if it should not arrive before the day fixed, there will, no doubt, be a further reprieve. If, on the other hand, the evidence should arrive, and it does not clearly establish the suggestion as to the state of the prisoner's mind, tho law wil in all proba- biLity take its course on the day mentioned.

			POLIC.
			MLtSIOYN .oUSR.-Elizabeth Fasselow, a bareheaded, barefooted, asd half-naked little girl, only seven years of age, was charged with wandering aboat the streets of the city at night ia a destitute condition, having been refused admittance into the City of London Union by tho relieving officer.
			A policeman said he found the prisoner wandering about the streets between 10 and 11 o'clock on Friday night, and was told by her that she had nowhere to go; upon which he first took her to the Union, where she was refused admit- tance.
			The LORD MAYOR.-Refased admittance! What, a child like that, only seven years old 2
			Officer.-Yes, my Lord, they positively refused to take her in.
			The LoRD MAYOR.-And what did you do with her ?
			Officer.-I took her back to the station, and kept her there all night, to take care of her.
			The LoP.D M.YoR.-I am glad to find you were more humane than tho people at the union. I should like to know how they can explaia their conduct.
			Officer.-Tho relieviag officer Is here, I believe, my Lord, for that purpose.
			The LoRD MAyoR.-Then, let him stand forward.
			Mr. Chapman, relieving officer of the City of London Union, accordingly stood forward, and said-" My Lord, that girl is one of the wickedest and most troublesome girls I ever saw."

			THAYFa-Captein 0. E. Sinclair, the master of the ship GRichard Thornton, appeared to answerachargeof assaulting George Browin Mault, the steward of that vesseL.
			MEr. Gomm,from the officeof Mr. CharlesYoung, solidtor, conducted the prosecution; Mr. Joseph Smith, solicitor, defended the accused.'
			It appeared from the evidence of the complainant that on the 25th of March last, when the ship was in tho Chops of the Channel on her return voyage from Batavia, he was dishing up eomne soup in the galley and the ship was roUling very much at the time, and gave a lurch, which caused the thin part of the sOllp to go over, leaving the thiek part at the bottom of the tureen it was in. A seaman named Holmes went with the remainder of the soup to the captain who was displeased at the appearance of it, and sent for the steward, and end to hi, 'Yon black son of a -, what do yon call this?" The complainant said an aciddent had occurred; on which the defendant filled a metal ladle with a pint of the hot soup, and threw it into the steward's face. It blinded him for some time, and he wss in considerable pain. The defendant followed this up by 3trikingthe com- plainant a Flow on the head with the ladle. The Flow was represented to have been inflcted by the captain " with aU his might," and the complainant bent under it. The defendant also struck the complainant on the side, kicked him, and, saying " Get out of this," sent him upon deck.
			A witness who saw the assault committed confirmed the statement of Mault.
			There was a second summons against the defendant for wages. 141. 2s. wastheamountclaimed byMault, andonly lOL Uls. 2d. had been tendered by the defendant. Mr. Gomm said he would accept the lesser sum tendered by the defendant, and would candidly admit the complainatm vwas more than once the worse for liquor, turned out of the cabin, and reduced from the situation of steward to that of cook. The wages had also been reduced, and he could not resist tho reductions made.
			For the defence it was proved that the complainant was often drunk, and that he had once attempted suicide by cutting the arteries of one hand and arm, which caused him to lose a good deal of blood. The captain bound up the
			complainant' wounds, and was very kind to 1im. It was also stated that on the day the alleged assault took placo the steward spoiled the soup. It was black and dirty and the captain and officers could not take it. The defendant took Eome of the soup out of the tureen, and "Ladled" it over the complainat's ead.
			On Mr. SELFE asking the defendant, wiho was swom, why be did that, be replied thot the coimpainant was very fond of rersing and dressing bls bdir five or six times a-day, and taldng oil out of the chest for that par-pose, and he thought he would, ive him a taste of sonp over his hair instead of it The complainant had a profusion of b3ack hair, wotskers, and moustache.
			Mr. SEFEx said be thought it wa3s a very Improper act to throw not soup over the complsluant's head, and most un- justifiable. The assault wa3s clearly mande out, but, in con- sideration of the general klndness ephibited by the captai
			towards the steward, he should not Inflict a heavy penalty. He sentenced the defendant to pay a fine of 5Qs.
			Catherine Abbott, an aged Irishwom3n, surrendered on bail, beforel Mr. Ssisw, to answer a charge of receiving, knowing to ha stolen, 661. 13s.
			The prisoner occupled a small and dirty apartment In Bnsce's-bufldings, Upper East Smithfield, and about 131. 3s. in silver, wrapped in various parelGs, purses, and hags, and a half-sovereign in a small piece of paper, w ere found in a box. A bag containlng 521. 10a. in gold was discovered under come rags in the same room.
			Tho prisoner told many lies about her possession of the money, and at last said it belonged to her son, a day labourer on the wharfs end on the river in the neighbourhood of Wapping.
			Ch7ristopher Abbott, the eon, whose evidence wvas anything but satisfactory, after stating the amount incorrectly, was corrected by his mother, and he swore thee money had been saved by hima from time to time in the course of the last
			ine years, end that it was choice, not necesslty, which caused him and his mother to tve in a smsfo room, for which they only paid is. per week.
			Kelly, a police constable, 10 H, said the prisoner had been long suspected of receiving stolen money from the basket-girls and others, who robbed saiors; and that two women clatmed thce money as tho property of their sister who bad been "sent away" for robbing a sailor of a con- siderable sum.

			MIr. Charles Young, w;ho attended for the prisoner, said that the money relly did belong to the prisoner's son, who was an mIdustrious ad frugal man. The suspicon of Kelly that three women had been wrongfully convicted of hobim, was sUnou,nded. ifleebble, madetyective officer, w ho had cbharge of the case alluded to, believed the right persons had

			Jlr. SFiLSE said if innocent persons had been convicted tho police ought to take up the matter, trace the guilty, end bring them to justice, but his impresion was the women who had been convicted of robbery were not inno- cent and had been properly sentenced to a long term of penal servitude. lf the sailor who had already sworn to two women as having plundered him swore to two others, his ovidence would hlave very little weight. As to the money, he could not say it was not the savings of the prisoner's son but the affair looked very suspicionsindeed. le discharged the prisoner, and ordered the money to be restored to Chris- topher Abbott, the son with a recommendation to take better care of it than he haa done.
			On Saturday the following additional subscriptions were received by Mr. SsLvE for the widow and surviving ohil- dren of a man named Pearce, drowned in Qsreenborongh Swale, with one of his eons, by the capsizing of a barge he was navigating :-" M.

			LAM T.-A fashionably-dressed woman about 3syears of age, who gave the nme of AunnHowel, was charged with beinf6concerned with another woman not in custody Ins stealing from Mrs. Mary Patrick, a widow lady, a gold watch, of the value of 30 guineas.
			hire. Patrick said that on Thursday afternoon she left her residence, No. 2, F'rederick-terrace, Commercial-road, Potkham, for a [short walk, and had not proceeded far wherL she was accosted by the prisoner and another equally well-dressed woman, who asked her the nearest way mto the Kent-road. Believing them to be re- spectable persons and strangers, she took some pains to point out the precise direction, and they detained her nearly five minutes in altarnately asking questions about the omnibuses that starTed thence, and one of themn said they had been misdirected a day or two before, and they in consequence had some dlfficulty in making their way. AU this time they stood close to her, and particnlarly the pri- sonar, who was quite in front of her and held her muff be- foreher,and he istan the lef hershe(Mrs. IPatrick-)
			nearly in front theyhbadrobbed her of her watch. ~he[prisoner and her companio at once comnmesced running,anshwsfol- ing them as well as che could when a man, who she had no doubt was a confederate of theirs. placed himself in front of her, and, putting both his arms up, said, "P1ray don't flurry yourself."1 The prisoner and her companion by this time turned the corner o a street, so that she lost sight of them for a moment, but in a few minutes the prlsoner was brought bask, and she at once charged her with stealing her watch, and her reply was, that she knew nothing about her watch, and that she was a re-spectable person. In reply to the questions of the magistrate, M.rs Patrick said she had not the slightest doubt as to the prisoner being one of the per- sons Who aocosted her in the manner she had describod, nor had she the slightest doubt also that she it was who took her vwtch. The watch was removed from the svivel that attached it to the chain, and the swivel was not at all injured.
			Sergeant Castleman, 33 P, said the prisoner was glven over to his care by the person who had stopped her, and at the station-house she said she had been to see a friend at No. 35, Wellingbton-street, PeckhaTu, and that she resided at No.-, Norland-square, Notting.hill. On inquiring at the latter placo the address was foand to be false, and there was no such street as Wellin"ton-street inPeckham.

She gave a minute description of the dress and appearance, of the w,omen, end the descrip- tion of one tallied so exactly with that of the prisoner that he had no hesittion whatever in saying she was one of them.
			Witness was not aware that the pris-oner was, in custody or* of the nature of the charge against her untl he saw her in court and heard the particulars, else he should have had the lay in attendance.

			POLITICAL POEMS and aSONGS OR TE1P
			PLAN TAGENETS.*
			The political songs of a people am part of its history. SIhe popular saying of a certain Northern Dhilosopher ascribes to them more induence in the making of this history than ,we are ourselves altogether disposed to con- cede. At all events they are l material in- cidents of res actually gestce which the student of history will highly appreciate, and in which others besides historians will find matter of interest. The present volumae, for example, contains such mnatterin very appreciable proportion among a vast heap of archaeological cinders. In substance it comprises such political poems and songs as belong to the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II., or such of them-for these must be part only of a much greater number composed-as have been actually preserved in manuscript by collectors.
			These poems are published under the Master of the Rolls'Commission, and are edited byAMr.Thomas Wright, a highly competent annotator. But, wherefore this collection includes none of the com- positions of an earlier date, when such are known to exist, is not here expiained to us. The truth is, we must find this explanation for ourselves in the circumstance that Mr. Wright has already edited many of these earlier songs in a separate volume published by the Camden Society. It can also be said for the selection of these poems, to the exclusion of their predecessors, that they illustrate a stage of peculiar interest in our national development-the space between what may be considered as properly the feudal age and the recognized commencement of ,ur modern history.
			Z.ow, tlere is one circumstance which is obvious at the outset, as we run cur eye through this collection -for it is significant of the national unity by this time attained-and this circumstance is the disappearance of the Anglo-Norman language. Throughout the whole series there are only two pieces i any dialect of French, and these, though in- timately connected with English politics and history, were both composed abroad. On the other hand, latin predominates largely during the whole of the 14th century, and even during the earlier part of the 15th. This indicates, no doubt, as Mr. WVright pertinently observes, the very deep interest and active part taken by the educated classes-those whose minds had been formed in the Universities- in the political events of the time; and it shows further a considerable degree of mental cultivation amongthe aristocracy in general, to whom many of these Latin poems are speciaUy addressed. It is probable that this was much less the case as we approach the age of the wars of the Roses; when we find Latin rarely used in these poli- tical poems, and the few cases in which it is used are of a specially clerical character. A monk of St. Albans put some events of these wars into Latin verse, but then these concerned the house of which he was a member. Bult at this earlier date the Anglo-Norman was disappearing, and yet a vehicle for the growing unity of the nation was still wanting. In short, English thought was only beginingl to find itself a medium in the forms and phrases of the English language.
			As far as the present volume extends, the Latin, as we have already remarked, largely predominates. The first poem in the collection is, however, in Nor- mnan French, and it describes the vows of the Heron, sworn bv Edwvard III. and his Court, for the speedy invasion of France. But this poem is of French origin; it was discovered at Berne, and printed by St. Palaye in his Ienoir.e of Clhivalry ; and it is peculiarly French in another sense, that it is as de-
			icient of historical truth as the majority of French authorities generaUy are on subjects of English history. The respective views of French and Eng- lishmen are expressed with more authenticity in some of the poems which follow, especinlly those of the latter, in an invectire againtst France, written in the autumn of 1340. France is there represented as
			" foimine3, Pharl&amp;-sa, vigoris idea,
			- Lynxea, viperes, vulpina, lupina, Medes,
			Callida, syrera, crudelis, acerba, superba,"
			and it is affirmed, as the obvious inference from Crecy, that
			"Tertins Edwardus, aper Anglicus et leopardus,
			rhe qualities of French and English are furthercon- trasted in a cataract of invective which we commend to MIr. Bright, if he wishe3 to know in how great a
			degree our wars have been nourished by purely na-| tional and pogular antipathies. See how thewriters of the same date exult over the Scots who were beaten in the battle of Nevile's Cross, and for whom no Scripture similitudes are too harsh and unc. savoury. Hear them on the truce of 1347, after the surrender of Calais to the arms of Edward:-
			"Ad bellnm vadunt, deus est conductor eundo;
			"Ad mala fata cadnnt, Sathan est ductor redorndo."
			The writers proclaim, as a proof, that God ap- proved of the war, and disapproved of the armistice, the circumstance, mentioned by others, that King Edward and his fleet had fair weather when they sailed from England; while, on their return, they encountered violent storms and narrowly escaped being lost. God was displeased, says the bard whose particular effusion is preserved, that the King should return before he had accomplished the grand object of his expedition by driving the usurper from the throne of France. If, with the spring, King Edward recommenced the war with
			. igonr, no doubt the same great qualities which he had hitherto displayed would carry him through to the end he desired. Victory would be his reward if he continued the war; but in a truce he would only be the victim of treachery and deceit. A series of Enalish songs by Lawrence Minot, on this and similar topics, are all set in the same high militant key:-
			"Hlaly Gaste, thon glF him grace,
			" That he in gude time may begin,
			"And send to him both might and space
			His heritage wele for to win."t
			And agaln the Virgin is implored to take care of the English king, a~fter the manner of a backer of Tom Sayers as against the Benicia boy .
			"Mlary. hate mlinde of l hy men,
			"-Thou wettest whamn I monoe; " Lady, think what I meue;
			" I mak thee my moan;
			"Thou wreke gudo I(ing Edward
			" On wikked Syr John."
			Fromthewholeseriesof these poems it is conclusively manifest that the English people were never so pleased and rarely so piously thankful to Provi- dence as when King Edward or his eons were pitching fiercely into Frenchmen.
			A Latin poem which follows these songs is par- ticularly curious for the form ill which it displays the hatred which then existed betwreen the two countries. Its form is that of a dispute between an Englishman and a Frenchman, in which the latter commences by calling Anglia the "F.Tx hominum, pudor orbis, et ultima rerum." The dispute descends to personalities as to their respective appearance, garb, and diet. The Frenchman excuses his atten- tion to his hair and the paleness of his face, for which the Englishman had accounted in an offensive mianner:-
			"St pallet facies, a Pallade paUor in ora
			*-Extt, at aVercro non veniet ite color."
			He retortsxupon the Englishman his addiction to eating and drinkling:-
			" Qnos prxter pecudes alit Angis? Venter eorum "Est Dons, et ventri sacrificare student."
			And then comes a rash reflexion upon English beer:-
			" NYos alit ipse liquor viti,j f'rx venditur Anglis, " Quo cuni sit liquida cren tar esse lquor."
			Even of the latter, says the Frenchman, he doesn't get a sufticient quantity, but onlv drinks it on rare and festive occasions. The Engiishman retorts at length, and the substance of his retort is an intima- tion to the Frenchman that he is simply aSfenalefe. But he bristles up at the close on the subject of his bher into something like poetry, that is, if poetry, accord- Ing to the implied delinition of Audrey, is very un- like the substance of an affidavit. The reader should ,observe tbat the Englishman doesn't throw away his powder in maintaining the siperiority of malt and hops to attenuated claret. What should a French- man know of ale? How could he und!erstand the etingo and the treble X of such a possible reprooff The Engolishman simply maintains that ltis viue is better than the French wine,
			"Gallia de vit3 palearu metit, Anglfa granum,
			Hiaurnmus lionfilum.c cters Gallus hahet."
			If the reader recalls Douglas Jerrold's Prisoner of War he will recollect that this is just the retoAt made by Peter Pall Mall when he is pressed in his controversy on the comparative merits of England and France, with the suggestion that France pro- ducees Bordeaux wine. "'You should taste our En glish Bordeaux," says the unabashed patriot, without dreaming that he was anticipated by a inedLhuval Englishman, who wrote patriotic Latin in the middle of the 14th century.
			The popular character of these war3 with Franco ,Political Poem and Songs relating to English Hitery. composed during the perfod from the accession of Edwa3d IIto tst of Richard IIL VoL L 14ngmans. lS59.
			is still further exhibited in a poem on the death of Edward IIL, in which the writer mours over the lost prowess of Edward and his sons, and indulges in melancholy anticipations of French reprisals
			"Ah, dere God, what may this be,
			" That aUe thing veres and wasteth away S"
			Onee England had been agood ship of noble msale, and with lofty tower-one of the chief appendages of a ship of war atthat time. It weathered storm and tempest without fear and without damage. The ship was furnished with a rudder to steer and govern it,such as could not elsewhere be found in the world; and while rudder and ship held together, they were proof against all dangers:-
			"This rudder was neither ok nor elm,
			" Iit was Edward the Third, the noble knight; "The Prince his son bar up his helm.
			"That never scomfited was in fih'."
			A sure mast belonged to the ship, with a strong and large sail, and this mast of the ship represented the good Commons, who maintained the war with their wealth; while the wind which flled the sail was the breath of their good prayers. Hear this avowal in English plain song from the popular ballad- monger of the 14th century:-
			"The good Communes, by the rood,
			" I liken them to the schipe's mast,
			"That with their chatel and with their goode,
			" Maintained the war both furst and last."
			These goods and chattels were, in fact, consumed, with their evident approval, so long as there was a Crecy or a Poitiers to the credit of the account, and no one grudged the estimates even for aggressive wars, so long as these wars were sufficiently sanguinary and successfully sustained.
			Wahen the tide of military success had slackened, towards the close of Edward's reign, then came the turn of the Manchester school of that day ; a party was formed in opposition to the Government, and it commenced to overhaul the national grievances. MIany of the younger nobility joined this party, and the Black Prince himself drew towards it, while it was strengthened by the increasing trials and errors of the Court. The John Bright of the time, though
			in many respects unlike his great successor, ap- peared somewhere about the year 1370, under the assumned name of John of Bridlington, and drew up a review of the reign of Kina Edward under the feigned character of a prophecy in Latin verse, represented as having been made long before, but now rendered intelligible by a pretended prose gloss or commentary. The writer is in substance an exponent of the grievances under which the na- tion laboured, while the reasons he assigns for concealing his name are sufficiently curious. He feared, first, the tongues of the envious, who might pursue him with their detractions; secondlv, the power of the nobles, whose vengeance he might provoke by what would be taken as personal attacks; and, thirdly, the indignation of wise and discreet men, who, strong in their own superior intelligence, might be offended that he, a young man, should presume to meddle with a subject of so much pro- fundity ; that is to say, he had a special disinclina- tion for controversy with the Jack Cades, the Peers, and the Publicists of the days of the Plantagenets. With these excellent reasons for preferring the press to the platform, this scribe details the story of Edward's reign, dwelling with marked reprehen- sion upon its melancholy close. Evenhe, however, declares that the wars with France were caused by the pride of the French, and by their continued attempts to rob the King of England of his castles and territory on the Continent. Eng- land, he maintains, In the style of a can- did reviewer of the policy of the second Pitt, was ferced into the war against its natural inclina- tion. The French thought that with their gold alone they were able to conquer England, "but," says the writer, who maintains that Providence was on the side of the 14th century Tories, "they were deceived, for the help of God with justice is worth more than many treasures." The French jurists had decidel that, according to the law of France, a female could neither inherit nor convey the right of inheriting to her male descendants, but our writer retorts with his passages from the Bible to show that this was contrary to the law of God.
			Thus the John Bright of the Plantagenets had no objection to a French war; in fact, he aUleges
			a groun�L In its Justitication which we never heard before-namely, that previous to Poitiers the French spoke reproachfully of the English, and among other things pretended that they were born with tails! Nevertheless, he seems to have had as great an objection to taxes as his successor, and to have expected, somewhat unreasonably, that the King should be a benefactor to churches and monasteries, yet without seeking to extort money from his subjects. In these days he would have knownthat suchluxuries as "Big Bens,"Aldershotts, Channel Fleets, and Boons to knowledge, must at least be paid for by a tenpenny income-tax; but in the Crecy and Poitiers days his notions were con- fused, and he had a vague appreciation of national equivalents, while he looked for correctives of national evils to war, earthquake, fire, and pesti- lence. The national evils on which ho declaimed were chiefly court scandals, treacherous counsellors, simony in the church, extortions by the judges, and, finally, jagged garments (panni ocesi). John of Bridlington denounces slashes, scallops, or pink- ing, and the many times varying fashions of the year, with all the ardour with wbich our great re- prover Punch has long pursued the exuberance of crinoline.
			John of Bridlington also recurs ageain and again, though somewhat obscurely, to certain peccadilloes of the popular monarch, of which there are traces to be found in the Chronides. Notwithstanding the remembrance of the fair Philippa and her goodly progeny, of which a father might well be proud, the great Edward, especially towards the close of his life, was much less circumspect in his rela- tions with the fair than H.R.lH.'s may and can be in days of stricter surveillance. WVe have all heard of Alice Ferrers, but John of Bridlington tells us also of a certain Diana, who occupied Ed- ward at the siege of Calais, while his gallant soldiers ran short of bread.
			*- David peccavhe quia Bamrsbe clunagitavit "
			or, as the writer says more plainly and pertinently to the particular case, "dicitur clunagitata," i.e., suppositfa per regem vef aliuzm quti cumn ed concudntit." The writer is simple enough to betray himself in touching upon this particular scandal, for he ex- cuses himself from entering into further detail, lest he should draw upon himself the enmity of the lady he refers to:-
			" Si modo plus dicam, faciam mihi tune Inimlcam."
			Now, as the supposed John of Bridlington was re- presented as living at the beginning of the preceding reign, he could hardly be afraid, by uttering the words with which he pretended to be inspired, of provoking the hostility of a woman who, whoever she may have been, was then probably not born, and was destined to be a Ro Yal concubine only in the middle of the following reign. *Yhereupon illr. Wrioht, in virtue of his critical acumen, tears off from John of Bridlington the mantle of prophecy, and exposes him, on his own admission, as a contem- porary of Edwardus Tertlus.
			After John of Bridlington, the poets of this volume chiefly belong to an age of thickening con- fusion and expected change, and their utterances are consequently far more sectional than national. During Edward's reign the desire for civil and re- ligious liberty was becoming daily stronger ; a re- form movement was advancing steadily though silently, and it had numerous preachers busily em- ployed among the middlie and lower classes, whom it natuirally split up into sects and parties. Thus Lollardism and Jack Straw insurrections were pre- paring. The dazzling glories of the French wars, and the great feeling of personal attachment to Edward Ill. which prevailed among the Commons of England, prevented for a long time any strong or open demonstration of the popular sentiments, hut during the latter years of his reign the discontent had been gathering, which soon broke out in scenes of turbulence under the misgovern. ment of his grandson. Unfortunately, the really popular songs connected with these events-and there undouibtedly were numerous popular songs current at the time-were the least likely to be preserved, as the class most interested in them were not in possession of books in which they could write them. Such as we have here belong chiefly to the clerical side, and are hostile to what we should now caU the " mob." Nevertheless there are some poems and passages even here in which the popular hatred of the monks and friars is significantly expressed. An earthqualke happening ominously while the Council of London (13S2) was sitting to pronounce judgment upon Wycliffe and his ad- herents, one of these poets breaks forth against the clergy in a long peal of Latin verses. He complains of their simony, pride, and licentiousness, and of the splendid edifices raised by the begging friars, and which were no better spiritually than dens of wolves. In truth, says the writer, they are either thieves or they make oipney, which is treasoi
			against the Crown. They caU themselves public mendicants, and theyprotect themselves against the inclemency of the weather with rich and expensive clothing, while they exclaim with the Pharisees, " Lo, what we suffer for the love of Christ I" These friars preached everywhere that whoever died in their habit would escape the torments of hell and pass directly to heaven. Yet if a rich man in the neighbourhood was taken ill, one of the order would hasten to him andlabour to persuade him to give his corpse to the friars- but if a poor man in sickness went to them to beg them to give hira burial, the reply was that the guardian was absent, and the supplicant was turned out of doors. Thus the supposed privilege of those
			"Who dying put on the weeds of Dominic"
			was worked, like other spiritual inventions, with a lucrative 'object. WVith the same object the friars in their chapters drew up letters, which they called suffrages, by which they made those who paid for them partakers in all the masses, prayers, and abstinence they said or performed for themselves, caring little whether the purchasers were worthy or not. So many shares were thus distributed, that the writer conjectures they must have had very little left for themselves. They were guiltyofmany greater crimes than these, of which, says the writer, " I wiU not here speak; but I say farewell to you, friars ! Whoever throws his net among you is sure to catch reprobates." The same writer then turns to the maonks and their arguments against WVycliffe, which, inthe case of one Crophorne, he stigmatizes as not worth unurn stercus canis; such was the popular view, even in the pra-Buckle age, of theological equivalents. The English song which follows contains a more general attack on the friars, and is rich in even satirical irony. Men might see by their appearance, the writer says, that they were given to great penance, and that their diet was simple and spare. "I have lived 40 years, and I never saw men fatter aboct the lkidneys than are these friars. Where they wander about the country they are made so thin by want of meat and
			are so reuucecL by penance that each one is a horse load when he wi truss out of town." It is much to be lamented, he says, that they should be alowed to go by two and two from town to town to seek their sustenance, dealing in " divers mercery" as though they were pedlars. They carried about in their bags purses, pins, and knives, and girdles and gloves, and such articles " for wenches and wives ;" but wherever they haunted, the husband "ever thrived backward," for during the " good man's" absence the friar would come to the dame, and spared neither for sin nor shame but he " did his will." In fact, the writer says, the friars would fare but poorly if they had no help of housewives in the hus- band's absence. They were far eceverer traders than an ordinary pedlar, and they knew, too, how to con- jure; for one ot them, with a pound of soap, would gain a kirtle and a cape, and if he gave a woman a knife that cost but twopence he would have the value of ten knives from her before he went. The writer next proceeds to warn his readers who may have handsome wives or daughters against allowing any friars to come near them, and after describing the consequences somewhat coarsely, concludes thus summarily:-
			"Though he loure under his hood
			"With semblaunce quaynt and mylde, " If thee hlm trust, or dos him geed,
			"iBy God thouerd cr yfd."
			There is much more of the same tenour, and, what is still more curious, a poem called " The Complaint of the Ploughman" of 1393 or 1394 (the Plough- man, since the publication of " The Visnons of Piers Ploughman" being the adopted representative of religious and political purity), in which the Plough- man narrates a dispute which he heard between two " Fovls," a Griffon, the advocate of the Romish Church, and a Pelican, its opponent. Of course, the Pelican has much the best of the argument in the Ploughman's version of their dispute; but we are strongly reminded of a subsequent dispute be- tween the Hind and Panther, who probably knew nothing of the Griffon and the Pelican's previous attempt at controversy. On the other hand, we have here poems written entirely from the opposite point of view; and as the reign of Richard grows more feeble and ignominious, "Ancient Gower" himself comes in to lead the opposing chorus, and to denounce Lollardism also as among the vices of the day. In the poems of Gower and his contemporaries we find discontent with the existing rule, and espe- cially with the King's favourites, Scroope, Bushey, and Greene (the bush, the grass, and the bag, as they are termed symbolically), and this discontent is seen preparing the way for the advent of the House of Lancaster, of which Gower at length cele- brates the triumph in a profusion of adulatory verses. Richard must have been already a fugi- tive or a prisoner when Gower could afford to con- trast him with Henry IV. in this wise:-
			"Duplex cautelis fuit R., pius H. que fidelis-
			"IR. pestem mittit, mortem pius H. que remittit; "R. servitatem statuit, pius H. que salutem;
			"IR. plebem taxat, taxas pies H. que relaxat*-
			And so on, vaguely indicating the tendency of the age, which at this time was drawing the governing classes, and the clergy especially, to the side of pius H. and the persecuting House of Lancaster. This tendency was, indeed, but the natmral recoil of the moveme..ts of WVycliffe and Jack Straw, a reaction against the menacing impulses of spiritual and prmdial revolt; but for a time it was potent enough, as even these poems indicate, to enlist the terrors of society and to arrest the Reformation.
			There are other bearings, no doubt, to be got out of these poems, according to the point of view from which they are approached. But we have said enough to show their general interest as a contribu- tion to English history. MIany of them, indeed, are not now published for the first time. The " Vow of the Heron," as we stated, was printed by St. Palaye; the English elegy on the death of Edward IIL. appears in the Archleologia; the allite- rative poem on the deposition of King Richard rr. had been previously edited by 'Mr. W`right himself for the Camden Society. But if all of them, which we assume is far from the case, had been printed already, it would still have been desirable to print them in this coUected form, for the convenience of reference, and for the light which they reciprocally reflect upon each other.

			Sir,-Your translation of " cursor " is quite right, and Ir. Bowyeris quite wrong. "Curser" is a good old English word, and will be found in any good old dictionary. It means " a runner." It does so happen that Mr. Bowyer's cursers both run and curse; but that is no reason why we should change our langunage and ostracise a word which has the merit of being appropriate in a double sense.

			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI.UES.
			Sir,-I am happy in being able to inform your corre- spondent "E. L. C." that, at all events in one rural deanery, some'hing more than talk has resulted from the discussion concerning the insufficient incomes of many of the clergy, and the consequent clerical distress.
			In the deanery of Southwark an association has been formed for the purpose of augmenting the snall benefices within its limits, and so thoroughly has the project com- mended itself to the mlinds of the clergy that everv one of the 60 incumbents has promised to support It by ani annual sermon in his church. For once, at all events, every note of discord and party has been laid aside, and aU are work- ing barmoniously in the furtherance of a common object.
			The plan proposed is to raise funds by collections In church, annual subscriptions, and donations; for these to be divided by a committee, consisting in equal numbers of the most influential local clergy and laity, who have been elected at a ruri-decanal meeting at the close of each year among the poorest benefices in the deanery, upon the con- ditlon that their several incumbents obtain a grant from the
			ecclesiastical Commissioners to meetthe sum voted to them. These grants will double the amount locally raised at the rate now adopted by the Commissioners.
			In ten years it is hoped that every benefice in the deanery may thus be raised to 2001. a-year. At present there are 16 benefices with incomes ranging from 36f. to 1501. a-year, and with populations averaghig about 7,000 to each. Such an association, I am persuaded, only needs to be inown among the wealthy merchants and traders of Tondon to be liberally supported.

			A MIGHTY HUNTBB.-
			Tast year v e had to invite the attention of our readers to a strange sect that has lately Esprung up a3mong us, Its creed, like that of most sects, is limited to a single article,-implicit faith in moun- taintops as the zoiG a)- of human kind. The devotees of this new releion are never satisfied unless they are either climbing or persuading their friends to climb impossible steeps. It is a difficult and repulsive religion which irresistibly reminds us of the fact that the great enemy of mankind when he would tempt the best of us " taketh him up into an higa,h mountain." If we must cultivate a superstition, we prefer something more genial, and a work has lately been published which makes us acquainted with the ways of a peculiar people, who have long lourished in these idlands, and who nourish a fine fanaticism that is as healthy as it is heathenish. It consists in the worship of an unclean beast-the fox, which is regularly mar- tyred and then canonizedwith strange rites and many libations. These votaries first kill their god, and, if they do not eat him, they stuff him, they put his head into a glass case, they put his tail where they can always gaze on it, and they surround them- selves with innumerable symbols and mementoes of the unclean beast. They have a language of their own, which, like the phrases of the con- venticle, is a mystery to all but the peculiar people. They call a tail a brash ; they speak of "a meet" and "a find-" they say that the hounds tail; they talk of drawing a cover and hunt- ing a country, and charging a bullfinch. Charging a bullfinch I What on earth is a bull(inch, and what is meant by charging it ? Nor is the supersti- tion by which the holders of such language are in- fluenced altogether a harmless one, as one may easily discover by consulting them on what is, in winter at least, an Englishman's everlasting sub- ject of conversation-the weather. The weather is the foahunter's "raw." Ere is dogmatic contradictory, preposterous, intolerant, and in- tolerable on the subject of the weather. It
			would be as indelicate as offering ham to a Jew to suggest, in the hearing of a foxhunter, that a frosty day is a fine one. The superstitious wretch, lost to all consideration of the general wel- fare, is thinking only of his horse's feet, and the pain of falling on the frost-bound earth. Even here, however, we detect certain re- deeming graces. The foxhunter is humble, and, unlike the self-righteous mountain-climber, who wiU perch up and crow as high above his fellow-men as he can possibly reach, rejoices in a falL It is, no doubt, a grand object of arbition to leap as high as possible, but we find that Air. Assheton Smith, the high priest of the sect, actually rode for a fall. He would urge his horse at fences which no horse could leap, and which were only to be got over by voluntarily accepting the humiliation of a fall. "Catch my horse," cried Lord Kintore to a rustic standing on the other side of an impossible fence, as he threw himself and his steed over it, unmindful of the faU that awaited both; and almost all the votaries of this heathenish religion exhibit a sweet resignation of character in describing the many times they have been forced to renew their acquaintance with the mother earth.
			The saying of one of Mr. Assheton Smith's hunts- men is very characteristic. Shortly after the death of Mr. Smith, George Carter sought an interview with an old friend of the family, and with much earnestness made the following proposition:-
			" I hone Sir, when I and .Tack Frcker nad Wil Bryce (the Whips) die we may ho laid alongside master in the MIausoleumn, with HIam Ashley and Paul Petter (two hun- ters), and three or four couple of his favourite hounds, in order that we may bo all ready to start again together in the next world."2
			Here we see the grandeur, and the immortality of foxhunting. When all else is to decay it will survive amid the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds. A perpetuity of foxes will be followed by an eternity of hunters, all clothed, not in white raiment like the saints, but in pink-most glorious pink. Naturally we ask what is the nature of this superstition which promises a future so brilliant-what are the benefits that attend the worship of the Beast ? Now, the ancient expositors of the advantaaes of hunting always declared that it was a means of escaping from idleness and from the seven deadly sins which are the inevitable consequence of idleness. Diligent hunters, it was argued, are always sure of a pleasant place in the next world. As if this werenot enough, however, a grave and profound Sir John Eardley Wrilmot writes a very pleasant book to show the marvellous good achieved by those who follow the Beast. Among other evidences of the blessings con- ferred on society by this sect,he quotes a poem beginning with these words:-
			";I siug foxhunting, and, the gen'rous rage
			" Which spurs the noble youth of this new age, " With careless toil-e for tTheir countrsty's gooa, " To rid us ot those vermin of the wood
			That nightly steal, and for their luncheon hoard
			" The ponltry which shonld smoke upon our board."
			From which it appears that the admiration accorded to the fox is of a piece with the adoration which certain votaries accordcto theDevil; they worship and warwithhim. Once atthebreakfa5ttable atTedworth AMr. Assheton Smith was intent on the newspaper, when suddenly he uttered an expression of horror, and his countenance exhibited the most poignant emotion. The ladies present, supposing that some great European calamity had occurred, hastily asked him what was the matter, and were told by the old gentleman, looking over his spectacles, " Bv Jove a dog-fox has been burnt to death in a barn." The enthusiastic votary of the chase, the man who hunted six days in the week all through the season, the high priest who had immnolated innumerable foxes, and who could show to his friends one knife with which he had cut off no less than 1,50o
			tails, was bowed down with sorrow when he heard of Reynard being destroyed without the usual cere- monies.
			The arguments in favour of this pursuit are so numerous that it would seem as if its advocates were anxious to make up for the weakness by the multitude of their reasons. W'e gather, for example, that fox hunting is in perfect harmony with the de- ductions of free trade. During the panic created by free trade a worthy farmer remarked to MIr. Assheton Smith that the cultivation of corn would soon cease. "So much the better," observed the squire, " for then I shall hunt over a grass country." Another foxhunter seemed to be equally in favour of the repeal of the corn laws. Lord Southampton is reported to have said trium- phantly to a farmer who was too fond of overriding his hounds, " I think, Sir, that Sir Robert Peel's Bill will stop you, though I cannot." And in addition to these arguments the present author advances others, such as that the sport is entirely, and in its perfection, exclusively British, from which the inference is that it is to be cultivated as the safeguard of nationality. Then, it is a sport which tends to the maintenance of a superior breed of horses for peace or for war. It tends also to make good cavalry officers, and it is well known that the Duke of Wellington in choosing his aides-de-camp always preferred foxhunters, because he said they knew how to ride straight at a given point, generally had good horses, and were equaUy willing to charge a big place or an enemy. In this way MIr. Assheton Smith may be said to have materially contributed to the success of the British arms in the Napoleonic wars, for the Duke used to say that many of the most distinguished riders in the Peninsular War owed their horseman- ship to him. Nor is this all that can be said for the sacred mysteries of the hunting-field. Our old friend Mr. Newdegate says that, though Assheton Smith's devotion to hunting was exaggerated, yet beneath it lay the purpose of fostering the manly qualities of his fellow-countrymen ; and Sir John Eardley Wilmot sees in it " the best coirective to those habits of luxury and those concomitants of wealth which would otherwise render our aristocracy effeminate and degenerate." The modern goes beyond the ancient champion of the chase. The ancient admirer of hunting said that it was a means of avoiding sin and getting to heaven. The modern author says it is the best means of correcting aristocratic vices and combating the dan- gerous influence of that wealth which we Inow on verygood authority, to be theroot of allevil. Notonly does the worship of the unclean Beast thus con- tribute to a purer morality-it has a grand political influence in promotinac the union of all classes and in maintaining thEe authority of the higher over the lower grades of society; and it has an economical advantage as regards the employment of labour in encouraging the market for homegrown produce. When TIr. Smith

			determined to hunt theAndover country, everyboy said that it would be impossible to do so on account of the enormous size of the woods. He set to felling the trees on every side; the green rideB opened as if bymagic; Andover sssumed the appearance of a great timber m nart; the labourers had plenty of work, and the poor rmigeht be seen bending lunder the load of faggots freely given to them to cheer hearths which till then bad but seldom shonle with the genial warmth of a blazing fire.
			On the death of Asr. Asheton Smith itt ws sug- gested in these cotlmnsthat he was a little too fanaticalinhis devotion to the pleasures of the chase. The general few that wss takuen of his character was that, with good abilities, Sith singular energy and with a heart that, if a ittleroueh in its displays generally, beat in the right place, Mr. Assheton Smith was a little crazy on the llbject of the chase, and magnilied it into an importance scarcely worthy of a rational being. The friends of the worthy squire fired at the critic ism,and herenis a book from Sir John Eardlley WVilmot, in which wre are an- swsered by two overpowering o rgeuvents. The first is that foxhunting and the whole duty of man so marvelously coincide that it would be impossible for any one to devote himself too eaclusively to the sport. It is a religion in itself so beneficial to the votary and so advantageous to society that it is im- possible for any mortal to work out all the icimit- able good wvhich lies hidden in the sacred pursuit. The second is that, though the fox is a deity worthy of being exclusively worshipped, ar. Asshotan Smith unfortunately fell short of his duty and gave much of his time and attentionB to other pur- suits. lSobody that we knowr of has ever disputed this, and, seeing that foxhunting lasts but a certain number of months la the year, it would be difficult to runderstand how any man of active habits and ample means should not fill up his time writh other avocations. Wre are quite prepared to hear that he was a firstrate billiard player, and beat a cele- brated marker in Paris; that he was a first- rate swimmer. rower. vurilist. and shot: and
			that he was- one of -thi best, if not the best, batsman of his day, insomuch that the side on which he played at cricket was almost in- variably successfuL Besides all this, was he not a member of Parliament ? and did he not use to hunt the hounds at Tedworth in the merning, postingg to Westminster in the evening in order to vote with his party ? The versatility of his mind was yet again shown in the fact that for three of his houses he devised a railroad from his kitchen to his dinina- room, along which the dishes passed and repassed in order to obviate the necessity of his servants quitting the room. He was a still greater inventor. He was the first who practicaUy-we do not say theoretically-proved the value of hollow waterlines for areat speed in navigation. He built yaeht after yacht, in which the wave principle, which is now proved to be perfectlv successful, was, in spite of the advice of the shipbuilders, adopted for the water line of the vessels. More is yet to be told. Sir John Eardley UWilmot claims for him the honour of having originated the gunboats which have lately figured very largely in the naval estimates of both England and France. Assheton Smith urged the necessity of building gunboats on the Dake of Wel- lington and others, and had his views been followed a little earlier our late naval campaign in the Baltic might have been attended with results more honour- able to our arms. Lastly, he had slate quarries in Wales, which he worked with great vigour, sparing neither labour nor capital to bring all the newest appliances of mechanical skill to bear upon them, giving employment to about 2,400 men and boys, and with the aid of schools and churches doing all that he could to promote their moral well-being. It is very pleasant to hear all this. It would be very absurd in any one to attempt to deprive Mr. Assheton Smith of the credit which belongs to such varied occupations successfully pursued. We may be permitted to ask, however,whethera11this information affects in any essential degree the estimate of his character formed at the time of his death. We sup- pose it will still be admitted that he made foxhunt- ing the principal object of his life; that he regarded it as the grand thing worth living for; that if he paid great attention to the training of the children on his estates, he gave ten times as mueh thought to the welfare of the cubs in his coverts; that in his view there was no sight on earth to be compared with the glories of a meet, no music on earth to be compared with the music of the hounds, that to him the fox was nearly as sacred as an ox to a Brahmin, and that it was Heaven for him to live with a brush in his view, as a Hindoo dies in ecstacy if he can hold a cowtail inhishand. No one ever said that Assheton Smith was a man of one idea. He was accused of giving to one idea an importance to which it had no right.
			In spite of his craze i the matter of foxhunting, we confess to the inconsistency of admiring Assheton Smith It is pleasant to see energy and spirit such as his displayed even in a questionable cause. He had wonderful pluck. He was flogged by his father under a tree for disobedience. IJnder that tree he made a vow never to do anything- from violence or compulsion. His nurse once said, " I can do nothing with klaster Smith, Sir; he will do nothing he is told," and his father immediately laid the child across his knee and administered a whipping. The consequence was that young Tom Smith developed his previous vow into a resolution never again to do whatbewastold,andhe acted on it. He was eminently combative, and seemed to be continually involved in pugilistic encounters. Offering himself as a Parliamentary candidate for the borough of Kotting- harn it was dificult for him to get a hearing. He
			quieted the mob by shouting out-" I wiU fight any man, little or big, directly I leave the hustings, and will have a round with him now for love." He took to foxhuntiag very early in life, and, with large means at his command, soon acquired a reputation as " the first horseman of the age." Napoleon addressed him as "Le premier chasseur d'Angleterre," and Wtellington addressed him as " Field Alarshal of Foxhunting." He hunted in Leicestershire, in Lincolnshire, and in Hampshire, and his direction of the hunting-field became very faiious. He provided the best of sport; he man- aged the field with great ability, and he set an example in horsemanship which none could surpass. He would ride at fences which no other horseman would attempt. Ononeoccasionherode atsuchafence and got over without a faU by breaking the top raiL Even then, not a man would follow him. Re had a remar.able power over his horses, and could get out of them what no one else could. His heart was in the business. "rPve known him," says Dick Christian, "come all the way from Belvoir to Gumleyof a morning, two-and-thirty miles, to cover, and back again at night." He lived among hounds and horses, and dreamt aU night of foxes. His activity, his daring, his skill, and his tenacity of purpose have never been exceled. These qualities excited the admiration of all who saw him ; and if strangers were sometimes repulsed by a certain roughness of manner and pugnacity of disposition, those who knew him more intimately discovered beneath thiscrust the liberalmaster and the generous friend.

			THE RELIGIOUS DrqSENShIO2S OF ST. GEOBQZS-
			IN-THE-EASZ.
			RENEWAL OF DISTURBANMES.
			Yesterday (the high festival of Easter) was selected by the ziotex of St. George's-in-the-East for a renewal of those desecratlons with which the oldpalish churchand the neigh- bourhood generaUy are by this time IrettyweU fauillalrzed, Since the questlon was some weeks ago brought under the notice of Parliament the church has been attended by large bodies of police, as many as 300 being at each service. This strong constabulary force standing along the aisles san ia the galleries checked any materlal outbreak of popular discontent, and restrained that mob fury which the sacred character of the place and tho religlous ceremonies per- formed there had previously failed to appeases On Palnm Sunday (yesterday week) the police were withdrawn, with the exception of about 10 or 12, who, under the direction of Inspector Alison, tookt'helr places round thealtar. Atthat time the information had not spread that tho police had been withdrawn, and the congregation was tolerm- bly peaceful, blr. Mackonochie, who preached, being only slightly coughed at, and tho rector being bissea when ho pronounced the blessing from the altar. On Goodl Friday the congregation was Ecanty, and at the evening service it was not found necessary to open the galleries. Throughout this service the gas was turned down to the lovest point, so that the gloom of the church might corre- spond with the solemnity ot the day. The altar was com. pletely covered with blaek cloth, wh3ch did not tend to render the appearance of the sacred edifice more chesful. Several protesters "said" the responses very emphatically, while the clergy and choristers intoned them; and 3Mr. Bryan King, who preached, was very slightly interrupted in his sermon, which was an earnest and appropriate dis. course founded on the 6th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, 6th verse :-"Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to en open shame,"
			Although the service yesterday morning was very mtceh disturbed, it was left for last night to witness a series of the most disgraceful outrages ever perpetratel in any church. The conduct of the mob was perfectly brutal0 but it cer- tainly was not entirely without provocation. At the morn- ing service the gates were kept closed until 10 minutes after
			the usual time, the churchwardens themselnes being denledc admission, and In the evening 'he same conse was repeated, some hundreds of persons professing to be parlshlon3s being kept out in the rain until 20 minutes to 7, while per. Sons who avowedly had no connexion with the parish wero allowed to pass through the privato gate of the rectory into the church. The consequence was that when the mob was admitted the excited people rushod In in the worst possible humour, and began howling and yelling with al their force. Nor were they rendered less pacific when their eyes were attracted to the gaily-decorated altar. It was covered with a white cloth f6Ued with crosses and em- blematical devices, and surmounted by a number of crosses of various sizes, formed of red roses, white roses, and red and white roses mixed. There were also vases oE flowers on the altar. Over the guzasi altar hung the chande- lier, at which hassocks, Prayerbooks, and Bibles were freely thrown ono Sunday evening. On this occasion It had two circles of wax candles-altogether about 32 in number-fes. tooned with evergreens and red and white roses. About 10 minates after the riotous congregatl[n had been admitted a white-robed chorister came forth from the vestry, and, with a long red with a taper attached, began to light the candles. This was the signal for a terrific uproar, which it is needless to describe, for it was of precisely tho same character as that which has bean SD often reported. It was so intense, however, that the churchwarden was sent for, and accordingly went to the vestry-room. At 10 minutes past 7 the churchwarden (MIr. W. J. Thompson) came out of the vestry-room, and, approaching the altar, evidently in a very excited state, exclainied to the people who were crowding round the altar, "Take your seats!" The mob shouted, " Where? " To which Mr. Thompson replled, "Anywhere l and 40 or 50 people at once broke through the altar ralLs.
			A gentleman named Adams, who has for a long time past taken an active part in favour of the rector and his party, rushed to the altar gates to preserve that sacred part of the sanctuary from further invasion, and, being a powerful and determined young man, succeeded to a great extent In accomplishing his object. The rioters quafled bcE ore him, but his triumph wvas of the most shertlived character, for two policeconstables, and a parochial o66icernamed Button, acting tender the direction of the churchw;arden, hurled him froma his post of defence, and he was summiy ejectedfrom the church with.a good deal of violence. Mr. Thompson then went within the altar rails and cleared out the intruders. It was now about 20 mintes past 7 o'clock and a passage having been made through the mob a proces- sion of priests and choriscers moved from the vestry- room door towards the altar. Two of the cho. risters fought their way to the rails, but the whole of the other choristers, with Mr. Bryan Siug, the .rector, Mlr.S Dove, the curate, and 3Mr. M'Donald, the appointed preacher, were hemmed in by the mob, who were laboaring under the deepest excitement, and then drlven back in the most insulting manner to the vestry. Meanwhile it appeared that Mr. Thomupson had previously to the irruption upon the altar had an interview with therector, who insisted that he should find sittings for the congregation, a task which, under the circumstances, it was obviously impossible to accomplish. At half-past 7 o'clock another attempt was made by the priests and choristers to getto their piaces in order to cemmence the service, and thiss time they were more successful. After a struggle which did in- finite credit to their perseverance, Mfr. Dove and Mr. A'Donld and the choristers made their wv.ay to the altar, and Mr. King to the reading-desk his ascent to which was the signal for another display of howling, yeling, hissing, and slamming of pew-doers Amidst a succession of similar interruptions ie en with the service until he came to "the Beief," when he turned ronnd to the altar, with his back to the congregation, who, In thdr ignorance, hissed at the red lining of his Master of Arts' hood. This was the signal for a fearful clamour, during which the pollce, who had long odds to contend against, tarned several people out of the church, those being the principal offenders. When Mr. Bryan Sing descended from the desk there wass more howling, and this process was renewed when the Rev. Mr. M''Donald went into the pulpit. There vas a louad shout that he wore a huge cross upon his back, but this was a slght muistake, inasmuch as the simple adornment which the St. George's critics mistook for a cross was avwhite
			fur University hood. The rev. gentleman selected for his text the 17th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, verses 30 and 31,-" And the timnes of thir ignorance God winked at, but now comniandeth all men ever.ywhere to repent, because ho hath appointed a day in which he wrill judge the world in righteousness by that mau whom he hath ordained, whereof he bath given assarauce nnto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead." The preacher proceeded very well until he made soine particularly direct re- ferences to 'he congregation which were not con- sidered complimentary. tie stated that for 11 months past the church in which they wcre assembled had been the sceno of awful sacrilee ; that it was a monument of shame to penitent worshippers; that the clergy had been subjected to persecution, malice, and spite; and that if the people continued in this course God's judgments would surely faUl upon them. The courage of the preacher was great bat his success was doubtful, for his very serious admonitiomns and his well-deserved reproofs were evidently thrown away.
			The Easter hymn, " Jesus Christ is risen to-day," which was sung by the choir after the sermon, was travestied by the congregation with disgustino profanity.
			As the rector and his staff left the altar for the vestry a violent outrage vas committed upon them, and it will be no matter of surprise to hear that some of them have been seriously Injured. So savage was the con- duct of the mob who attacked them that Mr. Snperintendent Howse, who had been waiting outside, rushed in vith alarge body of police, and, having first guarded the altar furiture. succeeded in course of timne in clearing the church, many parts of which have suffered serious injary. Somo hnn- dreds of persons afterwvards amused themselves by walking about the neighbourhood, singing, with imore strength than harmony or propriety, the Doxology. And so ended Easter Sunday in St. George's-in-the-East.
			During the last few days Mfr. Kin", the rector has received several addresses. To one signed "y 150 graduates of the University he has returned the following answer:-
			" My dear brethren In the Church of Chrl-t,-In the midst of all mi
			rocnt anuectles and trials, nothisg. I assure Youa. b (lnder God's mey)sgiven me greater comfort thanthe addreacosef hertyeympathy which I have received from so many endergraduates of our two Univer- sities, for with youra I am connected by one ersonal (even though a merely honorarTy link, aud by several others of a very ner acd affectionate interest You have not teen rshamed to arow your sympatby with one who ha suffered rome mepsoach and lees in male- tainmg what he believed to ba the post of dute. and i doubt not that yen wauld he ready, to onffer, If cmlled upon to do Eo. in the cause of that dear Lor)d upon the eomcseeseasioa of whose persan for us we have now entered.
			"Believe me to be, ever yours, very sincerely and affeetionately in
			Him, " BRYAN KIG."
			The members of the " Guild of St. Alban," composed ex- clusively of Higb Churchmen. In an address to Mr. King, express the deep sympathy 'thev feel with him on the " wicked persecution he is still snffering from a godlesa and fanatical mnob,urged on by men who hesitatenottoinsultand misrepresent everv Christian principle and practice they are too degraded to comprehend and appreciate." Theyadd-".As members of asocletv pledgedtotherloaintenance of the Catho- lic faith in its inteerity, hound to believe In the graces con- ferred in and by the eacraments to support the clergy in aU practices enioined or allowed by the English church, calcu- lated to pronmotc decency, order, and reverence in public worship, and to resist every influence injurious to tbe proner freedomti it ought to possegs as a branch of the one Eoly - tholic andApostollc Church. weheartilythank God who has enabled you thus far to maintain His cause against the overwhelming wicketinss with wicich you hare to contend and *ve count it a great privilege to have been permitted however feebly, to bear witness to our principles by coming forward with others from timeto time to aid you in the services of your churches, and to protect youandyour fellow-workers froin the bruital fury of the mob."
			r w. J. Thompson has corsented to act as church- warden for another year. His c-lleague will be Mr. Gar- ratt, a sargeon prect-isng in the neighbourbood, who, if common report may be relied on, is a most determined opponent of High Church principles.

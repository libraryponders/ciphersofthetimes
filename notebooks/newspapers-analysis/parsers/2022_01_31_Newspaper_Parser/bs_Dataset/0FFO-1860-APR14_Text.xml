			SE&amp;UTIC MONOTHEiSM.*
			A work such asM. P-nan7s BisOitre Gisrale et SisJtme Cotrnpcsrf des Langtces &amp;mnitl7ucs can only be reviewed chapter by chapter. It contains a survey not only, as its title would lead us to suppose, of the Semitic languages, but of the Semitic languages and nations; and, considering that the whole his- tory of the civilized world has hitherto been acted by two races only, the Semltic and the Aryan, with occasional interruptions produced by the inroads of the Turanian race, IL Renan's work comprehends In reality half of the history of the ancient world. We have received as yet the first volume only of this important work,and before the author had had time to finish the second he was caUled upon to publish a second edition of the first, which appeared in 1858, with important additions and alterations.
			In writing the history of the Semitic race it was necessary to lay down the general characteristics which are common to all the members of that race, to enable us to speak of nations so widely separated from each other as the Jews, the Babylonians, Phoeni- clans,Carthaginians, and Arabs, asoneraceorfamily. The most important bond which binds these scat- tered tribes together into one ideal whole is to be found in their language. There can be as little doubt that the dialects of all the Semitic nations aro derived from one common type as there is aboat the derivation of French, Spanish, and Italian from Latin, or of Latin, Greek, German, Celtic, Slavonic, and Sanskrit from the primitive idiom of the ances- tors of the Aryan race. The evidence of language would by itself be quite sufficient to establish the fact that the Semitic nations descend from common ancestors, and constitute what, in the science of language, may be caUed a distinct race. But Al. Renan was not satisfied with this single criterion of the relationship of the Somitic tribes, and he has endeavoured to draw, partly from his own obser- vations, partly from the suggestions of other scho- lars, such as Ewald and. Lassen, a more complete portrait of the Semitic man. This was no easy task. It was like drawing the portrait of a whole family, omitting anl that is peculiar to each individual member, and yet preserving the features which constitute the general family like- ness. The result has been what might be expected. Critics most familiar with one or the other branch of the Semitic family have each and all protested that they can see no likeness in the portrait. It seems to some to contain features which it ought not to contain, wfhereas others miss the very expression which appears to them most striking.
			The following is n short abstract of what A. Renanconsidersthe salient points in the Semitic character:
			"Their character (he says) Is religious rather than poll- tlcal, and the mainspring of their religion Is the conception of the unity of God. Their religious phraseology is simple, and free from mythological elements. Their religious feelings are strong, exclusive, intolerant, and sustained by a fervour which finds its pecu- liar expression in prophetic visions. Compared with the Aryan nations, they are found deficient in scientifio and philosophical originality. Their poetry is chieflv subjec- tive or lyrical, and we look in vain among their poets for excellence in epic and dramatic compositions. Painting and the plastc arts have never arrived at a higher than the de- corative stage. Their political life has remained patriarchal and despotic, and their inability to organize on a large scale has deprived them of the means of military success. Per- haps the most general feature of their character is a nega- tive one, -their Inability to perceive the general and the atb- stract, whether In thought, language, religion, poetry, or politicas; and, on the other hand, a strung attraction towards the individual and Personal, which makes themmonotheistic n religion, lyrical in poetry, monarchical in politics, abrapt in style, and impractical for speculation."
			We cannot look at this bold and rapid outlin. of the Semitic character withoat perceiving how many points it contains which are open to doubt and dis- cussion. Wlre shall confine our remarks to one point, which, in our mind, and, as far as we can see, in M. Renan!s mind likewise, is the most important of all-namely, the supposed monotheistic tendency of the Semitic race. M- Renan asserts that this tend- ency belongs to the race by instinct,-that it forms the rule, not the exception; and he seems to imply that without it the human race would never have arrived at tvhe knowledge or worship of one God.
			If such a remark had been made 50 years ago, it would haverouwed little or no opposition. "Somitic' -was then used in a more restricted seose, and hardly comprehended more than the Jews and Arabs. Of this smaU group of people it might well have been said, with such limitations as are tacitly im- plied in every general proposition on the character of individuals or nations, that the work set apart for them by a Divine Providenee in the history of the world was the preaching ora belief in one God. Three religions have been foanded by members of that more circumscribed Semitic family-the Jewish, the Christian, the Mohammedan; and all three proclaim, with the strongest accent, the doc- trine that there is but one God.
			Of late, however, not only have the limits of the Semitic family been considerably extended, so as to embrace several nations notorious for their idolatrous worsip, but the history of the Jewish and Arab tribes has been explored so much more fully, that even there traces of a wide-spread ten- dency to polytheism have come to light.
			The Semitic family is divided by M. Renan into two great branches, differing from each other in the form of their monotheistic belief, yet both, accord- ing to their historian, imbued from the beginning with the instinctive faith in one God,-
			1. The nomad branch, consisting of Arabs, Hebrews, and the neig,hbouring tribes of Palestine, commonly caUed the descendants of Torah, and
			2. The political branch, including the nations of Phcenicia, of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Yemen.
			Can it be said that aU these nations, comprising the worshippers of Elohim, Jehovah, Sabaoth, Moloch, lWisrocb, Rimmon, Nebo, flagon, Ashta- roth, Baal or Bel, Baal-peor, Baal-zebub, Chemosh, Mtilcom, Adrammelech, Annamelech, Nibhaz and Tartalk, Ashima, Nergal, Succoth-benoth. the Sun.
			nIoon, planets, and aU the host of heaven, were endowed with a monotheistic instinct? M. Renan admits that Monotheism has always had its principal bulwark in the nomadic branch, but he maintains that it has by no means been so unknown among the members of the political branch aa is commonly supposed. But where are the criteria by which, in the same manner as their dialects, the relioions of the Semitic races could be distinguished from the religions of the Aryan and Turanian races? We can recognize any Semitic dialect by the trlliteral character of its roots. Is it possible to discover similar radical elements in all the forms of faith, primary or secondary, primitive or derivative of the Semltic tribes ? M. Renan thinks that it is. He imagines that he hears the key-note of a pure Monotheism through all the wild shoutings of the priests of Baal and other Semitic idols, and he denies the presence of that key-note in any of the religious systems of the Aryan nations, whether (reeks or Romans, Germans or Celts, Hindus or Persians. Such an assertion could not but rouse con- siderable opposition, and so strong seem to have been the remonstrances addressed to M. Renan by several of his colleagues in the FrenchInstitute that,without awaiting the publication of the second volume of his great work, he has thought it right to publish part of it as a separate pamphlet. In his Nowveles Co7arideations sur le Caradelre U6nZrci des P?eup?es Smitiques, et en particulier sur teur Terdane an MonoVthiisme, he endeavours to silence the objec- tions raised against the leading idea of his history of the Semitic race. It is an essay which exhibits not only the comprehensive knowledge of the scholar but the warmth and alacrity of the advo- cate. Vith M. Renan the monotheistic character of the descendants of Shem is not only a scientific tenet, but a moral conviction. He wishes that his whole work should stand or fall with this thesis, and It becomes, therefore, al the more the duty of the critic, to incquire whether the arguments which he brings forward in support of his favourite idea are valid or not.
			It is but fair to l. Renan that, in examinina his statements, we should pay particular attention to any slight modifications which he may himself have adopted in his last memoir. In his history he asserts with great confidence, and somewhat broadly, that " MeMonothisme r6sutme et cxpliqzue tous le caraceres de la race Sentittaue." In his later pamphlet he is more cautious. As an experienced pleader he is ready to make many concessions in order to gain all the more readily our assent to his |general proposition. He points out himself with great candour the weaker points of his argumenet, though, of course, onlv in order to return with |n tabated courage to his first position-that of all the races of mankind the Semitic race alone was endowred with the instinct of Monotheism.

			impossible to deny the fact that the Semitic nationr, in spite of this supposed monotheistic instinct, were frequently addicted to the most degraded forms of a polytheistic idolatry, and that even the Jews, the most monotheistic of all, frequently provoked the anger of the Lord by burning incense to other gods, Al. Renan remarks that when he speaks of a nation in general he only speaks of the intellectual aristocracy of that nation. He appeals in self-defence to the manner in which historians lay down the character of modern na- tions. "The French," he says, " are repeatedly called 'une nation spirituel,' and yet no one would wish to assert either that every Frenchman is spiritnel, or that no one could be spirit2K6 who is not a Frenchman." Now, here we may grant to Ml. Renan that if we speak of " esprit " we natur- ally think of the intellectual minority only, and not of the whole bulk of a nation; but if we speak of religion the case is different. If we say that the French believe in one God only, or that they are Christians, we speak not only of the intellectual aristocracy of France but of every man, woman, and child born and bred in France. Even if we say that the French ore Roman Catholics we do so only because we know that there is a decided majority in France in favour of the unreformed system of Christianity. But if we were to say that the French are a nation without religion because some of the most distin"uished writers of France have paraded their contempt for all religious dog-mas, we should justly be called to order for abusing the legitimate privileges of generalization. The fact that Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and Jeremiah were firm believers in one God could not be consi- dered sufficient to support the general proposition that the Jewish nation was monotheistic by instinct. A nd if we remember that among the other Semitic races we should look in vain for even fo-ar such names, the case would seem to be desperate to any one but Ml. Renan.
			WVe cannot believe that M. Renan would be satis- fied with the admission that there had been among the Jewrs a few leading men who believed in one God, or that the existence of but one God was an article of faith not quite unknown among the other Semitic races; yet he has hardly proved more. He has collected, with great learning and ingenuity, aU traces of Monotheism in the annals of the Semitic nations; but he has taken no pains to discover the traces of Polytheism, whether faint or distinct, which are disclosed in the same annals. In acting the part of an advocate he has for a time divested himself of the nobler character of the historian.
			If he had looked with equal zeal for the scattered vestiges both of a monotheistic and of a polytheistic worship, he would have drawn, perhaps, a less striking, but we believe a more faithful, portrait of the Semitic man. We may accept all the facts of M. Renan, for his facts are almost always to be trusted; but we cannot accept his conclusions, be- cause they would be in contradiction to other facts which M. Renan places too much in the backgronnd, or ignores altogether. Besides, there is something in the very conclusions to which he is driven by his too partial evidence which jars on our ears, and betrays a want of harmony in the premises on which he builds. Taking his stand on the fact that the Jewish race was the first of all the nations of the world to arrive at the knowledge of one God, M. Renan proceeds to argue that,if theirMonotheism had been the result of a persevering mental effort-if it had been a discovery like the philosophical or scien- tific discoveries of the Greeks, it would be necessary to admit that the Jews surpassed all other nations of the world in intellect and vigour of speculation. This, he admits, is contrary to fact. "Apart la superiorit6 de son culte, le peuple juif n'en a aucune autre; c'est un des peuples les moins dou6s pour la science et la philosophie parmi les peupleas de l'antiquitd; il n'a une grande position ni poli- tique ni militaire. Ses institutions sont purement conservatrices * lea prophlsea, qui reprsesntent excel- lenmment son genie, sont des hommes essentiellement r6actionnaires, se reportant toujours vers un id6al anterieur. Comment expliquer, al sein d'une socicte aussi etroite et aussi pen d6- voloppee, une revolution d'idees qu'Athenes et Alexandrie n'ont pas r6ussil -laccomplir v" M. Renan then defines the Monotheism of the Jews, and of the Semaitic nations in general, as the result of a low, rather than of a high state of intellectual cultivation. "I I s'en faut." he writes
			(page 40), "quo le Monothdisme soit le produit d'une race qui a des idees exaltees en fait de religion; c'eat en r6alit6 le fruit d'nne race qui a peu do besoins religieux. C'est comme minimum de religion, en fait de dogmes et en fait de pratiques extdrieures, quo le MIonotheisme est sartout accommod6 aux besoins des populations nomades." But even this minimum of religious reflection which is required, according to Mtt. Renan, for the percep- tion of the unity of God, he grudges to the Semitic nations, and he is driven in the end (p. T3) to ex- -plain the Semitic Monotheism as the result of a religious insiUct, analogous to the instinct which led each race to the formation of its own language.
			Here we miss the usual clearness and precison which distinguish most of Mi:. Reian's works. It is always dangerous to transfer expressions from one branch of knowledge to another. The word " instinct" has its legitimate application in natural history, where it is used of the unconscious' acts of unconscious beings. We say that birds build their nests by instinct, that fishes swim by Instinct, that cats catch mice by instinct; and, though no natural philosopher has yet emplained shat instiact is, yet we accept the term as a con-l ventional empression for an unenown powher work- ing in the animal world. If weo ransfer tbis word to the unconscious acts of conscious beings we s mzust necessarily alter its defioition. We mayn speak of an instinctive motion of the arm, but we only mean a motion which has become so habitual as to require no longer any special effort of the 'will. If, however, we transfer the word to the conscious thoughts of conscious belngs we strain the word beyond Its natural capDacities, we use it in order to avoid other terms which would commit us to the admission either of innate ideas or inspired truths. We use a word in order to avoid a definition. It may sound more scientific to speak of a monotheistic instinct rather than of the inborn image or the revealed trutlh of the One living Goda; but is instinct less mysterious than revelation? Can there be an instinct without an instigation or an instigator ? Aand whose hand was it that instigated the Semitic mind to the worship of one God ? Could the same hand have instigated the Aryan mind to the worship of many gods? Could the monotheistic instinct of the Semitic race, if an instinct, have been so frequently obscured, or the polytheistic instinct of the Aryan race, if an instinct, so completely annihilated, as to allow the Jews to worship on all the high places round Jerualem, and the Greeks and Romans to become believers in Christ? These are the difft- culties into which we are led if we use words for their sound rather than for their meaning. We begin by playing with words, but in the end the words will Dlav with us.
			There are, in fact, various kinds of Mlonotheism, and it becomes our duty to examine more carefully what they mean and how they arise. There is one kind of Monotheism, though it would more properly be caUed Theism, or Henotheism, which forms the birthright of every human being. What distinguishes man from all other creatures, and not only raises him above the animal world, but removes him alto- gether from the confines of a merely natural exist- ence, is the feeling of sonship inherent in and in- separable from human nature. That feeling may find expression in a thousand ways, but there breathes through al of them the inextinguishable conviction, " It is He that has made us and not we ourselves." That feeling of sonahip may with some races manifest itself infear and trembling, and it may drive whole generations into religious madness and devil worship. In other countries it may tempt the creature into a fatal familiarity with the Creator, and end in an apotheosis of man, or a headlong plunging of the human into the Divine. It mav take, as with the Jews, the form of a simple asser- tion that "Adam was the son of God," or it may be clothed in the mythological phraseology of the Hindus, that Manu, or man, was the descendant of Svayarnbhu, the Self-existing. But, in some form or other, the feeling of dependence on a higher Power breaks through in all the religions of the world, and explains to us the meaning of St. Paul, "that God, though im times past Hle suffered aU nations to walk in their own ways, nevertheless He left not Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
			This primitive intuition of * God and the ineradi- cable feeling of dependence on God, could only have been the result of a primitive revelation, in the, truest sense. Blan, who owed his existenceotI;l God. and whose belng, centered andzrestede'a God. j
			saw and felt God as the only source of his own and of all other existence. By the very act of the creation God had revealed Himself. There He was, manifested in His works in all His majesty and power, before the face of those to whom He had given eyes to see and ears to hear, and into whose nostrils He had breathed the breath of life, even the Spirit of God. This primitive intuition of God, however, was in itself neither monotheistic nor polytheistic, though it might becomo either, according to the expression which it took in the languages of man. It was this primitive intuition which supplied either the sub- ject or the predicate in al the religions of the world, and without it no relgion, whether true or false, whether revealed or natural, could have had even its first beginning. it is too oftenforgettenby those who believe that a polytheistic worship was the most natural unfolding of religious life, that polytheism mtst everywhere have been preceded by a more or less consdous theism. In no language does the plural exist before the singular. No human mind corld have conceived the idea of gods without having pre- viously conceived the idea of God. It would be, how- ever, quite as great a mistake to imagine, because the idea of God must exist previonslytothatof gods, that therefore a belief in One God preceded everywhere the belief in many gods. A belief in God as exclu- sively One involves a distinct negation of more than One God, and that negation is possible only after the conception, whether real or imaginary, of many gods. The primitive intuition of the Godhead is neither monotheistic nor polytheistic, and it finds its most natural expression in the simplest and yet the most important article of faith-that God is God. This must have been the faith of the ancestors of mankind previous to any division of race or con- fusion of tong,ues. Itmig htseem,indeed as if in suach a faith the oneness of God, though not expressly as- serted, was implied, and that it was there, though latent, in the first revelation of God. History, however, proves that the question of oneness was yet undocided in that primitive faith, and that the intuition of God was not yet secured. against the illusions of a double vision. There are, in reality, two kinds of oneness which, when we enter into me- taphysical discussions, must be carefully distin- guished, and which for practical purposes are well kept separate by the de�Lnite anud indetinite articles. There is one kind of oneness which does not exclude the idea of ulurality ; there is another which does. When we say that Cromwell was a Protector of England, we do not assert that he was the only pro- tector. But if we say that he was the Protector of England it is understood that he was the only man who enjoyed that title. If,&gt; therefore, an ex.- pression had been given to that primitive intuition of the Deity wbich is the mainspring of all later re- ligion, it would have been-" There is a God," but not yet "There is but 'One God."' The latter form of faith, the belief in One God, is properly called Monotheism, whereas the term of Heno- theism would best express the faith in a single god. We must bear in mind that we are here speaking of a period in the history of mankind when, to gether with the awakening of ideas, the first attempts only were being made at expressing the simplest conceptions by means of a language mostsimple, most sensuous, and most unwieldy. There was as yet no word sufficiently reduced by the wear and tear of thought to serve as-an adequate expression for the abstract idea of an immaterial and super- natural Being. There were words for walking and shouting, for cutting and burning, for dog and cow, for house and wall, for sun and moon, for day and night. Every object was called by some quality which had struck the eye as most peculiar and characteristic. But what quality should be pre- dicated of that Being of which man knew as yet nothing but its existence9 ILanguage possessed as yet no auxiliary verbs. The verv idea of being with- out the attributes of qualitv or action had never
			enterecL Into tie ctumau nmmd. ilow then Was that Being to be called which had revealed its existence, and continued to make itself felt by everything that most powerfuUy impressed the awakening mind, but which as yet was known only like a subterraneous spring by the waters which it poured forth with inexhaustible strength ? WN'hen storm and lightening made tho naked wanderer seek refuge in the foreats,andthefaUlof mighty trees crush- ed at his side those who were most dear to him, there were, no doubt, feelings of terror and awe, of help- lessness and dependence, in the human heart which burst forth in a shriek for pity or help from the only Being that coald command the storm. But there wars no name by which IHe could be caled. There might be names for the storm-wind and the thunder- bolt, but these were not the names applicable to the author of all existence. Again, when after a wild and tearful night the sun dawned in the morning, smi Ling at man-when after a dreary and death-like winter spring came again with its sunshine and flowers, there were feelings of 3oy and gratitude, of love and adoration in the heart of every human being; but though there wrere namnes for the sun and the spring, for the bright sky and the brifllant dawn, there was no word by which to caU the source of all this gladness, the giver of light and life.
			At the time when we may suppose that the first attempts at finding a name for God were made, the divergence of the languages of mankind had com- menced. We cannot dwell here on the c-uses which led to the multiplicity of human speech; but whether we look on the confusion of tongues as a natural or supernatural event, it was an event which the science of langasge has proved to have been inevitable. The ancestors of the Semitic and the Aryan natiops had already become uninteligible to each other in their conversations on the most ordinary topics, when they each in their own way began to look for a proper name for God. Now one of the most striking differences between the Aryan and the Semitic forms of speech was this :-In the Semitic languages tho roots expreesive of the pre- dicates which were to serve as the proper names of ahay subjects, remained so distinct within the body of a word, that those who used the word were unable to forget its predicative meaning, and retained in most cases a distinct consciousniess of its appemative poger. In the Aryan languages, on the contrary, the signficative element orhthe root of a word, was apt to become so completely absorbed by the deri- vative elements, whether prefixes or sufflxes, that most substantives ceased almost immediately to be appellative, and were changed into mere names or proper names. What we mean can best be illus- trated by the fact that the dictionaries of Semitic languages are mostly arranaed according to their roots. Wuhen we wlsh to ind tho meaning of a word in iebrew or Arabic we first look for its root, whether triliaterah or iial, and then look in the dictionary for that root and its derivatives. In the Aryan languages, on the contrary, such an arrange- ment w.ould be extremely inconvenient. In many words it is impossible to detect the radical element. In others, after the root is discovered, we find that it has not given birth to any other derivatives which would throw their converging rays of light on its radical meaning. In other cases, again, such seems to have been the boldness of the original name-giver that we can hardly enter into the idiosyncrasy which assigned such a name to such an ob,iect.
			This peculiarity of the Semitic and Aryan lan. guages must have bad the greatest influence on the formation of their religious phraseology. The Se- mibic man would call on God in adjectives only. Every one of his words was more or less predicative, and he was therefore restricted in his choice to such words as expressed some one or other of the abstract qualities of the Deity. The Aryan man was less fettered in his choice. Let us take an instance. Being startled by the sound of thunder, he would at first express his impression by the single phrase, B t1hundrs,-Pfpovr~. Here the idea of God is under- stood rather than expressed, very much in the same manner as the Semitic proper names Zezb (present), Aibc (servant), . A5 (present), are habitually used for Z^abd-aizh, Albd-allah, Au-allah,-the servant of God, the gift of God. It would, however, be more in accordance with the feelings and thoughts of those who first used these so-called impersonalroobs to translate them by " He thunders," "He rains," "He snows." Afterwards, instead of saying simply " He thunders," another expression naturally sug- gested itself. The thunder came from the sky, the sky was originally called Dyaus (the bright one), and though it was not the bright sky which thundered, but the dark, yet DIyaus had already ceased to be an expressive predicate-it had become a tra- ditional name, and hence there was nothing to pre- vent an Aryan man from saying " Dyaus," or " The sky thunders," in Greek " ZEa3povra" :et us here mark the almost irresistible influence of language on the mind. The word Dycaus, or Zv, which at first meant " bright," had lost this radical meaning, and meant only " sky." It then entered into a new stage. TAe Idea which had first been expressed simply by
			the pronoun of the third person, "C He thundors," wvas taen up into the word Dyaes, or "s8ky." "He thunders," and " Dyaus thunders," became syno- nymous expressions, and by the mere habit of speech Re became Dyaus, and Dyuats became He. Henceforth Dyaus remai7ed as an appellation of that unseen though ever present Power which had revealed its exi3teace to man from the beginning, but which remained ivthout a nalme long after every beast of the field and every fowl of theair had been named by Adam.
			Now, what happened in this instance with the name of Dyans happened again and again, with other names. When men felt the presence oi God in the great and strong wind, in the earthquake. or the fire, they said at first, "Re storms, Re shaies
			He burns." Bat they likewise said, the windi (Mfar t) blows, the fire (Agni) burns, the sab. terraneous fire (Ytclcanues) upheaves the earth. ad after a time the result was the same as before, and the words meaning originally wind or fire wero used, under certain restrictions, as names for the unknown God. As long as al these names were remembered as mere names or attributea of one and the same Divine Power there was as yet no polytheism, though, no doubt, every new name threatened to obscure more and more the primitive intuition of God. The names of God were like the idols, at first honest nttempts. at expressing or representing an idea vwhich could never find an adequate expression or repre- sentation. Bat the cidolon, or likeness, became an idol, the 7wnewn, or name, lapsed into a nu1n, or demon, as soon as they were drawn away from their original intention. If the Greeks had remem- bered that Zeus was but a name or symbol of the Deity, there would have been no more harm in call- ing God by that name than by any other. If they had remembered that Kronos, and Uranos, andApollon were all but so many attempts at naming the various sides, or manifestations, or aspects or persona of the Deity, they might have used these names in the hours of their various needs, just as the Jews called on Jehovah, Elohim, and Sabbaoth, or as Roman Catholics implore the help of Nunziata, Dolores, NTotre-Dame-de-Grace.

			The Royal Dublin Society's show-a great succez this year-fmrnished the Earl of Carlisle wvith another opportanity to convey his views respecting Irish progress in the march of agricultural im- provement. At the usual evening meoting last nig,ht, and after the declaration of the successful competitors in the varions classes, his Excellency replied at some length to the vote of thanks given to him for the interest he had manifested in the tiociety. He said,-
			"Some years have elapsed-to bce quite precise I believe 5t is five years exactly, almost to an honr-since I first dis- c3harged the hunoulrable function of President. It Is trao t,here hs been some break in the continuity of my perform anes; but yon will not need to be reminded how weo thba place was filed, and the duties performed, by my respected and accomplished predecessor (applause), who, as he wa keenly alivo to all that concerned the welfare of Ireland generaly, could not, and did not, fall to be specially in- terested in the progress of Irish agriculture. (Hear.) So, I trust, gentlemen, it will long continue, and that, kow- ever lengthened the eeries of Irish viceroys may be des- tined to be, it will be as in that custom of antiquity of which we read, when tho lighted torch was dell- vered from the hand of ono rumner to another, and although different arms held tho blaring brani aloft, the brlght flame stlU burned on steady and unquenched through whatever changes of successvo hands It was transmitted. It would bh indeed impossible for any ruler or any native of Ireland to be indifferent to her agricultural success (hear, hear), for IrHeland, however fondly her poets and orators may recur to the memories and legends of thec past is, in fat, becoming in every successive year more and more a naion (loud applause); for, in wvhat does the life of a naion mainly consist, but in the industry, the enterprise, the encouragement, and the weslfare of the people that inhabit it (heoar, hear," and renewed applause)d And if she becomes still more and more of a ration, it also follows, from the cbrcumetances of climate, oE posltion, ou temperamest, that she will be, above all things, an agricrl tural nation. (Hfear, bear.) I confess that I had felts some miswpprehension that tho dismal and f ngcdlmr weather w,ith which it hnas been our disagreeable lob to he visited of late-our protracted winter, the bilasts of Mss arch, and the eneows of April-would have told w.ith untoward effect on the vried and animated assembly in the courts below. Far otherwise, however, has been the case; and trne it is that, although theleaves hardly l as yet from the rees-althogh thehedgeshaveno prsrm eent and the banks no primroses-although our gardens grow blacker instead of greener, and our asparagus refuses to csell (laghter) , yet out com ou r shorthor u an d
			ulaerriea, vdth more rounded proportlon of form and more silkLy glo6ssness of skin then ever-out cemes in unrivaled mnaesty and rotundity of form Dr. thereal himself. (Laughter.) Who could look upon himwithoutcbeingdr
			minded of the enow white herds of Olytumnus-dd he act rook like the gresteproficial victm, I sfrind as tsUrnes ctmu ofus (84Lunghter.) I kngw that attention has been drawn oE late to the circumstance of there seeming to have been de- ficiency of produce indcorn and sevral other crops in Ireland,
			s appe s from the rerm-ns of the e (hGeneral, during last year. Now, every one must he aware that under tho permanent influenc of wheather and climato, as wel tas tho thousand cauLses which must tell upon ayear'ssupply and demand, it o ould be atterly delusive to lay stress upon the actual amount of cultavatlon or rate of production eany eingle or successive years. But the general question oi national progress or docay rmust bo tathered from a much more extensive unmmary; and, lookdng upon the condition of Ireland in this point of view, I nnd that since the cencus bsof 1841, not 20 years ago, there have been reclsimed oa waste lands no lees than a million rnd a half of acres. (Hear, hear.) Half a m1ilion of acres bave been added to the land actuslly nnder tillage-a point where a deof
			clencyefor thettime was eomplained of (hear, hear); afre
			with respect to live stock the value sineo the period I hava uamed has more than doubled. The quantity Itself has fulytdoubled, and the vale, I beoieve, has increased in a far greater proportion; and what I valuo still more than even the symmetry or substaLnce of the best Durham or Devons- the best Leicester3 or Cots olds, is that the wages of the people themselves-of those by whose strength and skil this vast amount of animal growth and developmnent, as well as of that varied vegetable produce which sustains man and beast, is produced, and tended and improved, has exhibited at least a corresponding ratio of Increase. (Applause.) Thuo Irish labourer Is Infinitely better fed, better clothed, better tended in sickness, and, I think, under the operation oS ci recent Act of Parliament, I may say soon, with the samt confdence, better housed than ho has ever been before (Applause.) I know there are still higher Influences to be brought to bear open him and upon all of us than the bread we are to cat or the ralment we put on but still I contend that agriculture in our day holds a very ldgh position, whien its processes generally have attained to the dlgnlt~yof 2a 6ecenca, and when its daily work corresponds with the best- directed efforts of patriotism and of charity."
			TUJ&amp; LIEUTENANCY OF LONDONDERTY.
			The Londonderru Journal contains the following defence of Mlr. Lyle's appointment:-
			"Some weeks ego, 'when Mr. Lyle was appointed Liente- nant of the county, we stated our opinion that no better ap. pointment could have been made, and that the selection was highly creditable to the Government. Havinrmia"omuchr
			we should probably have been content to awvait thoso exph- nations which must necessarily take place when Parllament meets, had not the statements which have been latterly made rendered it a matter of duty to place the facts fairly before the public. In and ont of Parliament, the ostensible object of those who assal Mxr. Lyle's appointment hasbcen to show that he is notquallfied byproperty,and that helsdlsquaufieed by position, from holdlng the ofice of LieuteRant of the county or properly discharging its duties. Now, first, as to Mr. Lyle'sposition. During the last 10 years this gen- tlemoan might have retired nny dlay upon anl a3nn31 allow.- auce of 2,O00O., and w;e believe we are justified in stating that in Aungust next he will be entitled to retire on 2,5001. peraunurm,independent of thefavourof any Government. He receives this relarinn allowance as a sum earued by hls past services. As a matter of rfoht. therefore. Afr. T,v"ln nn
			od no mozo arfens0ner ot the ht.ato thDn a general officer or aaiI nful a It is obvioas, then, that Illr. L,yle ais r ar position to aact imp- ily.rsective of the smile or f'rowns of any admistio^0n. WpVith r rad to the qualificationbyproperty, Mr. Whiteside, afternd'cavotng neverywvay to depreciate Mr Lyle's siton stated that he had only a smallmoiefa withL h heaamused his leisure hoars; hut that the subject of his anbmadverehens. had no landed property in tho county entiting him to such an appointment. On a subsequent occasion Colonel Fxench. asserted that the qualifiatian 'for the lieutenant is 2001. a year in fee, whereas Mr. Lyle does not posses any pro- perty in the county beyond a susall leasehola of I01) acres.' 'We think there is a mistake here. We have, reason to know that the Act regulating the office of LIentenant in Ireland does not render any such qualI
			ficatIon necessary; 200L., wo are aware, is the quszlfi. cation for a deputy-lieutenant. We have heard that in England a fee simaple property of 1,0001. a-year Is required to qualify for a lieutenanvy. Whether the statement re- specting England be correct wo do not at this momnent kneow bat wo'beleove that, even if a qualification of 1,0001. 3a-ye&amp;i' were necessary in this country, dIr. Lyle Is fully entitled by property to hold the office. Sir. Lyle happens to have in this county fee simple property worth 1,3001. per annum apart from his house -ad demesne, and some lcassiold pro- perty additional.

			FarnAY Evrnx=G.
			The English funds opened steadily this morning, audsoon experienced a slight advance. This was followed by a reaction, and at the official close prices looked dull. After regular hours there wvas a.aiu an upward tendency. Consols for money were first quoted 94* to :4. Some purchases on be- Half of the public then caused a rise to 941 to i, but the laat official transactions were again at 94, to a for money, and 949 to ? for the account. Subse- quently there were several transactions for the ZcCount at 04 . Bank Stock closed at 224 to 226. Reduced and New7 Three per Cents., 921 to 93; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Five per Cents., 105 to A; Rupee Five per Cents., 98; Five-and- I-Half per Cents., 103,; India Bonds, 5s. discoun' to par; and Exchequer-bills, 7s. to Uls. premium.
			In the Stock-Exchange to-day money was abun- dantly offered on Consols at Sj per Cent. At the Ban3k the demand for discount was moderate, and In the open market short bills were negotiated at a fraction below the Bank minirnum.
			In foreign atocks there has been a reaction in Mffexican, but other descriptions were generaly steady. Turkish Six per Centa. left off 76 to l, for Zhe 1854 loan, and 61 to i for the new; Brazilian Five per Cents. marked 100; Blexi- can, 214, : and A; Peruvian Four-and-a- lalf per Cent.

Allowing for interest on the unpaid instalments, the former stands at the present price at a fraction over 89, giving a profit of nearly 14 per cent. In exchanging from the old Four-and-a-Half per Cents. to the new.
			The last price from Paris this evening was 7Of. 20c., ahowinga fractional decline.
			Tho corn-market was firm this morning, and another advance of is. was obtained.
			The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the ;;eek shows dulness.
			In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was a considerable rise in the Paris rate. The quota- tions for Amsterdam and Hamburg are also slightly higher.
			There was again no withdrawal of gold from the Bank to-day.
			The Bank return of this evening presents most singular features. The amount of notes in circula- tion, which was already beyond all ordinary pre- cedent, shows a further increase of 1,600,0001. The everage total required by the public is between 19 and 20 millions, and they hold at this moment 23,467,0001. Compared with the same period of the memorable year 1857, when the trade of the country bad reached a degree of inflation never before known, the excess of notes now in use is 3,715,0001., or 10 per cent. No one, therefore, can
			complain of want of accommodation. The total, | in fact, is such as was never attained except I during the extraordinary time shortly after the gold discoveries, when the Bank bullion touched its highest sum, and Consols were at 101 ex. dividend, and the rate of money 2 per cent. The cause of the movement is still unexplained, or if an explana- tion be hinted, it is such as everyone must hope will prove unfounded. Looking only for a natural solu- tion, the circumstances now witnessed can spring only from a single cause,-namely, a sudden and wonderful augmentation of the business of the country. Supposing it to be a healthy augmenta- tion such as can be carried on at a profit, not- withstanding the advance in discounts, there will be reason for universal satisfaction, no less at the prosperity of the mercantile body, but also at the fact that capitalists share in it in fair proportion. Supposing it to be specu- lative or fictitious, then every one must hail the measures by which the evil is to be repressed. We know, therefore, that the advance in the rate is a great good, either as promoting a fair distribution of legitimate profits among traders and money dealers, or as a remedy for a dangerous condi- tion. Here all reference to the matter might end, the commercial and banking community being left to exercise their own judgment as to whether this astounding growth of trade is healthy or unhealthy. But within these few hours a report. has become current, which, but for the otherwise
			inexplicable character of what is going on, would; seem altogether incredible. The public are aware that since the experience of 1S57 the Bank have resolved to lend no encouragement to the vicious practice of rediscounting, and that, while opening their doors to the commercial community, they have for that reason excluded the discount brokers. On the inherent soundness of this policy there can be no dispute, and the leading members of the mercan- tile world have regarded it w;ith strong approval. It is now asserted, however, that in their dissatis- faction at its operation the discount firms have resolved to draw from the Bank as many notes as possible, to lock these notes up, and thus
			to create a sense of scarcity and an incon- venient advance in the Bank terms that shal induce aU business men to believe that they are suffering through the inability of the dis- count houses to help them, and that this inability is caused by the exclusion of those houses from the flanl. An operation of this kind would be at once so ridiculous and so censurable that every considerate personwill refusecredence toit,unless upon the autho- rity of the discount houses themselves. Indeed, but for the circumstances that the report this evening is In universal circulation, that the alleged particulars
			ran fully stated in commercial circulars, and that some individuals even af'irm that the parties in question virtuaUy admit its correctness, any notice -of it would seem improper, and, even as matters stand, the reference to it must merely bo for the iake of enabling an unequivocal contradiction to be obtained without delay.
			It has been announced that, in the event of the tenders for the 1,078,0001. Victoria debentures on Teesday being in excess of that amount, a prefer- ence in the allotments (the rates being equal) will be given to thoso applicants who may have been among the subscribers on the 11th inst. It is also said that if any balance should on this occasion be left on hand it will not again be offered until after August. On that subject we have received the following letter -
			SIr,-I beg to bo allowed to caU the attention of the public, through your columns, to a lagrant *iolation of oeod faithapparently contemplated by the agentsforthe ic- tons3 Loan.
			Trustitn thatthese gentlemen would be bound by the established usage on these occasions, and Lace alU persons subscribing for the loan on the same footing, I tendered for 20,0001. at 1T3?. and upwards per cent., and, tho mini- mus tixed by the colonists being 1051., my tender has, of course, been accepted. Upwards of 1,000,000?., however, of thelean net having been subscribed, the agents have now offered this amount to tho public at the prescribed mini- murm without Intimating us yet that I and all those who, in fullrelianco of being dealt within good faith, tendered in the dark-, and thereforo at much hi;,her prices, shall be in no way prejudiced by this unheard-of step. Now, these gentlemen may at first sight suppose that this course is honestly open to tbem, and that it Is to the advantage of their employers to adopt It becauso the whole of the loan has not been taken up; but a moment's reflection ought to satisy them that this cannot be so. It being of the very ensence of the contract between them and the subscribers that no one of them should havo any advantage over another, and that to that end the mininmun should be sacredUy kept from the knowledge of them all, so long as the publication of It might prejudice &amp;eyone of them, it Is not competent to these gentlemen, now that the 7ninimum has, of necessity, trAnspired, to accept fresh tenders at that limited price, without affording the same advantage to the first bond fide subscribers. To do so, indecd, would unquestionably
			vitiate the contract, and release the original snbscriber-S from all engagements under it it Indeed, it would not entitle them to redress in the Ueen'e 'Bench for loss sustained by the non-falfhlment of it. However embarrassing it may be to thesa gentlemen, there can be no doubt that they are bcimd in the negotiation of this loan down to the last shilling of it by the implied terms of thelr contract with the orlsinal subscrilers. Their sup- position that it would be benefeilw to the Colonial Govern- ment to attempt to hold the first rubscriber. to their ten- ders, while accepting lower terms from fresh sabscribers, is eqaaDy fallacous if really entertained. It Is weU under- stood that the Victoria Government Is coming back to this market during the present year for the remainlng half of the 7,000O,OOO. required for tho completion of its railways, and It can need no arguments to prove that the effect of the conduct In question would be to Induce the public to abstain from committing themselves to any tenders at rates at all likely to be accepted, until the agents should be compelled to disclose the mininicwm price. It has oeen pleaded on the past of these gentlemen that they are only agents acting under instractions from their principais, but they shoald remember that their agency is no sufficient warrant for act- Ing unfairly and doing wrong, and that it confers upon them no power which their principals do not themselves possess.
			No, Sir, let them be assured that this case is no exception to the general rule, and that honesty is the best policy.
			I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
			GOOD FAITTh
			The colonial produce-markets opened without animation this week, after the Easter holyday, and have since been quiet, owing to the stringency in the money-market and to the uncertainty still attend- ing political affairs. Moderate sales of sugar have taken place by private contract, including several cargoes of foreign for the United Kingdom. The Mauritius, at auction to-day, occasionally went 6d. per cwt. cheaper, particularly as regards low to middling qualities. Notwithstanding the favour- able position of the coffee-market throughout the
			.hief European ports, the late advance has not been folly supported, some descriptions of plantation Ceylon selling about 1s. 63d. per cwt. lower. Further arrivals are announced. Other kinds do not showany important variation. The extensive inquiry for rice recently experienced has partiaUy subsided, but general quotations remain uu- changed. There has been rather a better feeling in the tea-market during the last two days, owing partly to the China advices. Transactions to some extent have been reported in congous at lower rates for tayshan kinds, which, however, were subsequently resold at Ad. to Id. per lb. profit. Large public sales of Chinja commence next Thurs- day, and about 3,300 packages of Assam (chiefly of the company's growth) wiml also be offered. Salt- petre is firm, although rather inactive and holders refrain from pressing sales, looking at the diminished shipments from Osicutta to the United Kingdom. The next quarterly indig&gt;o sales are appointed for the 8th of next month. The accounts of the distulrb- ances among the ryots in certain producing districts of Bengal have at present exercised little influence upon this market.
			The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 11th of April gives the following re- sults when compared with the previous week :-
			P"bc "Depo 2s.. �5,878,135 ... Decrease �3,S18297 Other Depsits. 14,570,717 ... Incresse 604,369 Rest ... ... 3,200,497 ... Decrease 5S2,633

			The amount of notes in circulation is 23,467,2551., being anincrease of 1,621,6651.; and the stock of btllion in both departments is 14,637,1021., showing a decrease of 246,4951. when compared with the preceding return.

			D EXAY EVmNMG.
			The rise in the rate of interest has led to some realizations of railway stocks held on loan, especiaUy in the country, and sales have also been effected on the late continued advance, coupled with the en- hanced value of money. The railway market, although firmer in the morning, has therefore been rather depressed during the later hours of business, but still remains inherently good, the public not appearing as sellers, and the general traffic returns
			showing a further increase. The principal decEline to-day was in Midland, which left off fully 1 per cent. Iower, London and North-Western, Lanca- shire and Yorkshire, South-Western, South- Eastern, and Great Northern. At 4 o'clock London and North-Western was quoted 99 to j; AMidland, 116 to t ; Lancashire and York- shire, 104 to i; South-Western, 91i to 92
			Great Western, 683 to 69; North-Eastern-Ber- wick, 95 to A; ditto, York, 79 to A; North British, 603 to 611- and South-Eastern, 87- to i; and Great Northern 113 to 114. After all regular opera- tions had ceased there was a strong tendency to re- covery. In the colonial market Grand Trunk of Canada stock has receded to 33. to 34; and Great NVestern of Canada shares to 12 b to Indian guaranteed were also slightly flatter. IForeign de- scriptions, except French, were dull. Pernambuco left off 14 to lg dis., being an eighth lower, and San Paulo s to t dis., showing no altera- tion. In American securities the shares of the Michigan Central advanced. New South Wales Goverment Debentares are rather weaker. Mines have 'oeen inactive, and in one or two cases present a reduction. There was no change of importance in Joint-stock banks. In miscellaneous descriptions Canada and were quoted lower, while an improve- ment took place in London General Omnibus and Madras Irrigation. The new Victoria Debentures closed 104 to 105k; Canada Loan, 100 bonds, and . to 1 pm. scrip; Ocean Marine Insurance, 2.- to

			BUFFALO AND LAXE HURON.
			The report of the directors states that the total amount of capital authorized by the votes of the proprietors wvas 1,4S0,000L, and tho amount colUected 8G23731. The calls yet to be made amounted to 40,9011., the 7.402 shares in the hands of the com3pany represented 37,9S61., the prefor- ence shares 16,0401., the amount of unsubsrribed nmort- gage loan 11,5G00., and the difference between the nominal and actual value of the 1850 issue of capital was 461,2501. On the 22d of February the 38,5001 chattel bonds became due, on which day 16,000 were paid off, and only 22,5001. renewed for one year mere On the 20th of February the 7,402 shares of the April issue stated above as In the hands of the company, were placed at 51. 2s. 6d. per share, thus completing the Issue of 30,000 shares. During the half-year cnd- ing the 31st of January the expenditure on capital ac. cout, and in payment of the interest on bonds, amounted t o $227,261. The directors have given instructions that the remaining portion of tho work necessary to connect the railway with the harbour at Goderich, and the re pairs of the pier and improvement of the harbour itself, shall be sectionally dvided, and each secton submlitted to public competition for contract, so as to secure a Mlinimum outlay. The traffic receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of January, 1359, amounted to 32,8411., and the expenditure to 33,1001.; ending the 31st of July, 1859, to 21,7411., and the expenses to 27,1061,; and the recelpts for the half-year ending January last amounted to a6,S3b?., and the expenditure to 29,7551., leaving a profit on the working of 6,0811., whiclh, although not sufi- cient to pay the interest upon the bonds of tho com- p3ny, must, in the opinion of the directors, be regarded as satisfactory, as a result unachieved in any former period of the company's manamement. The working expenses for the half-year are at tSe rate of 1861. 16s. per mile, or 7. 2s. ld. per mile per week. The balance of profit was 16, 5 per cent. of the gross receipts, which average 8l. 1ls. 2d. per mile per week. The total charge for main- tenance of way and buildings between Fort Erie and Gode- rich was at the rate of 901. per mile per snnuam, including repairs of pumps, ballast-waggons, turntables, &amp;o. At the corresponding period of the preceding year the cost of main- tenance was at the rate of 1211. per mile per annum. The directors were disappointed that the hopes entertained of a mutual reciprocity of business .ith the Wvest- ern lines on the completion of the Grand Trunk sys- tem to Detroit, had not been realized. They were anxious to negotiate for the conduct of traffic with neigh- bouring companies on such principles .S would materially have promoted the convenience of the public, while prevent- ing theloss, strife. and discredit with which the nmrestrlcted contention for trafflc between rival companies had been so frequently attended. Their advances in this direction had been repulsed; and au agreement had been entered into between tho Grand Trunk and Great Western Boards, which it was understood precluded the former company from seeking to develope or interchange through businejs with Canadian companies west of Toronto. By this arrange- ment, the intercourse of the Western district.s vitz Canada, with the City of Buffalo, was restricted, and the free ex- change of trafflo was hampered, if not altogether ignored. Tho directors felt it their duty to repre- sent to the Canadian Government and Legislatare the injurious effect of such a combination UDon the mercantile interests of the province; and they had brought before the Governor-General in Council the claims of this company for pecuniary assistance, to complete Gederich-harbour, and develope the resources of the north-west portion of the
			the energetic exertions of IL-. R. S. Carter, the new general manager, had been very advan- tageous to the company by increasing trafic and reducing expenditure.-

			His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of"rBM h.s been over the fist 14 miles of the railway, accompanied by Mr. C. B. lane, the Government Inspector-General, and bythe officers of the company. The directors have thought it highly de- sirable to enter into an engagement vwth Mr. Watson to work; the first and second sections of the railway for 32 months after being opened for traffio; but prior to the engagement being carried out the sanction of the Tm- peria Era2ilia Government is requisite, to obtainwhich Mr. Hutton Vignoles, the principal resident engineer, hs been requested to proceed to Rtio de Janeiro. A call of i1.0ls. per share will be made in the month of June nex
			and a further call, for the same amount, in the course of the aut-umn. The relations of the company with the Imperhi Government and wiith the President of Bahla continue to be most cordial, and the Board are greatly indebted to the BrasihisnMIluister inLIoadonforhis support;* butihedirectoca regret to complaln of the exorbitant indemnities awiardedto the owners of the land required for the railway, and of ven. tions delays and protracted lawv proccedings in obtaining possession of these lands. The directors have felt it their duty to forward the centracter's representation to the In- peral Government, and respectfully to solicit measures of redress.

			LONDON, SATURDAY, APBRL 14, 1860.
			An argmnent has been invented in favour of
			Mlr. GLADsToNE's Budget for which Mr. GL-DSTONE
			himself and the numerous admirers of this last and most daring effort of his financial genius have no reason whatever to be ob]iged to its author. It appears that among its other merits the Budget has this also,-that it secures to us possession of eternal peace. Let no one suDpose that this end is attained by the degree in which the Budget may have conciliated whatever malice towards this country may exist in the mind of the French nation, and whatever lurking illwill to the French nation may exist in the mind of this country. We may-and it is to be hoped we shall-be better friends than we have been. We shall feel our mutual dependence on each other more than we ever did before. WVe shall be in debt to each other, we shal discount and endorse each other's bils, we shall prove under each other's bankruptcies, and we shaU sue in each other's courts. All sorts of endearing relations will spring up between us. We shall cure the French of that insatiable desire to rectify their frontiers, and the French will in return improve our taste and enliven our society. These are legiti- mate subjects of self-gratulation, but these are not the topics with which the argument we allude to deals. The great merit of the Budget, after all, appears, according to this argument, to consist not in its external, but in its internal efficacy; in one word, we rejoice to inform our readers that Mr. GLADSTONE'S budget wil render war henceforth impossible. Everybody knows that wars are
			trom tume to time got up by the wicked and cruel aristocracy, which tramples on the liberties of this country, not from any peculiar ferocity or desire of shedding blood, but merely for the purpose of justifying in the eyes of a deluded nation a vast military and naval expenditure. If we can only succeed in making it the interest of this aristocracy to keep our naval and military estimates much lower than we do now,-better still if we can render it impossible for them, without taking the burden wholly on them- selves, to provide for the country anything like the present army and navy, we shall make it so strongly the interest of the aristocracy to keep peace that war will become an impossibility. Now, we confess to a most sincere desire to keep peace, and we can imagine no way of keep- ing it more agreeably than by reducing expendi- ture and taking off taxation. We are therefore naturaUy captivated by so pleasing a prospect, and only wish to be told how AMr. GLADsToNE's Budget has effected for us this perpetual closing of the Temple of JANrs. MvIr. GLADsTo-E, it seems, has taken off so many indirect taxes and has in his capacity of Chancellor of the Exchequer so bitterly maligned, abused, and defamed those taxes which he has talen off, that they cannot again be reimposed. WlVithout their reimposition, anything in the way of naval and military expenditure beyond the happy and glorious estimates of 1835 would have to be defrayed by an Income-tax; that Income-tax the richer classes will never be induced to pay; there- fore they will wish to reduce our armaments- therefore they will not wish to go to war-and therefore they will continue to keep us at peace with all the world.
			Our readers will observe that the whole of this theory rests upon the assumption that it is the pre- sent governing class of this country which, for its own selfish ends and objects, gets up all the wars in which we engage. If this begrauted itseems to fol- low necessarily that the way to keep the peace is as soon as possible to dispossess these classes of power, or, tiU that can be effected, to make their interests identical vwith those of the nation by throwing on them the surplus of taxation which they themselves have caused. The Reform Bill may possibly achieve something for us in the direction of the first of these objects; it is claimed for the Budget that it possesses a eovereign virtue in effectin,g the second. The argu-
			ment is perfectly logical. The government of the country ought not to be left in the hands of a class which makes war for the sake of Incurring a 1lrge expenditure, instead of incurring a large expenditure for the sake of making war, and, if no instrument is ready to deprive this class of the power it abuses,it is well so to manage our finances, so to adjust our taxation, as to give this class an interest identical with the public. But how if it be utterly untrue that our large military and naval expenditure is the result of the jobbing and selfish spirit of a particular class ? How if this expenditure be made most reluctantly by sucGessive Govern- ments, whose financial operations it most seriously embarrasses, in obedience to the imperative wiUl of the people of this country, who have signified in the most distinct and unmistakable manner their determination to place these establishments, at whatever cost, on the most efficient footing, and have come forward by tens of thousands to supple- ment the exertions of their Government by under- taking themnselves the labour and expense of a thorough military training? How if it shall turn out to be the opinion of the nation at large, neither rashly taken up nor easily to be refuted, that peace or war does not depend upon the wiUl of this country, does not depend upon any person over whom the incidents of tax- ation could have any kind of effect, but does depend upon the wil of foreign Princes, placed at the head of vast military Powers, and animated by ambitions the end of which nobody pretends to foresee ?
			If these things be so, the praise which is be- stowed upon Mr. GLADSTOxN's Budget recoils upon it in the shape of the bitterest irony, for it reaUy amounts to this,-that at a period when it is necessary for the safety of the empire to make the very greatest sacrifices for the pur- pose of preparing the country to meet a danger which may at any moment be upon her, Mr. GLADSTON's Budget, by repealing and dis- crediting indirect taxes,which are paid by the whole community, and substituting for them direct taxa- tion, which is paid by only a portion of the com- munity, has rendered the continuance of efforts necessary for the public safety absolutely impossible, and reduced us to the necessity of disarming at the
			very moment when the interests of the nation, when the interests of peace itself, call upon us to raise a large revenue, and expend it in ships, in barracks, in cannon and rifles, in sailora and soldiers. The argument may be pushed still further. If we can once bring ourselves to believe that to cripple what has hitherto been our great strength and re- source, the raising a large revenue, is reaUy a great public service, that service is not confined to its effect upon the army and navy. Much more may be effected by it than the dismantling our defences, the disbanding our soldiere, the dis- charging our sailors, and the laying up our ships in ordinary. Why should we limit our panegyric on the fatal blow w-hich Mr. GLADSTONE is alleged to have dealt to indirect taxation to such matters as these? There are many other things which will bear a similar reduction with no worse effect upon the public interest. The salaries of our Judges are very far indeed from being reduced to the standard of Transatlantic frugality. We pay enormous sums for police; the education of the people absorbs at least a halfpenny in the pound of the Income-tax. We have a splendid Court and a diplomatic establishment. Supposing that the experiment of reducing our expenses, in order to redress the unequal burden of indirect taxation, should not end in relieving us from the management of our own affairs, and place them under the control of some less economical, but more warlike Power, why may we not go on in the course so happily begun, and relieve ourselves one by one of aU those heavy burdens which fill up the pages of our estimates ? If Parliament should stil retain enough of the old leav mi to object to interfere with the splendour of the Court, the safety of the Church, the security of the debt, the efficient administration of justice, or the protection of life and property, we have only to find a patriotic Chancellor of theExchequerwilling to take off a few more indirect taxes in order to bring a recalcitrant Legislature to reason. Nay, why do we haggle at smaU matters? After indirect taxation, the great source of our present revenue, has been sufficiently dis- credited, we may hope the time will come when an enlightened Legislature will relieve us altogether from the bnrdens of Customs and Excise, and transmute the Income-tax, by an easy transition, which the graduation of its payments wilU have greatly facilitated, into a tax to be levied on property, from which trades and professions will, of course, be entirely exempt. Notwithstanding these splendid antici- pations, we must profess our belief, old- fashioned as it may be, that the merit of a Chan- cellor of the Exchequer consists rather in de- veloping and enlarging than in destroying or drying up the sources of revenue ; that a nation is great and powerful in proportion as it is able to meet whatever demands the public service may make on its purse ; that a nation will be able to meet those demands just in proportion as its taxation is evenly diffused over every class in society; and that to limit that tax- ation or its increase to a single class is to place the pyramid on its apex, instead of on its bah -

			We are too little informed of the circumstances attending the present outbreak in Sicily to be able to give a confident opinion as to the probabilitio of its success. We cannot help remembering a long list of former failures. We have not forgotten the fire and slaughter of Catanea, nor the sudden appearance nor the sudden suppression of the insur- rection headed by the Baron BENTrVETI;A. There is no doubt that the Sicilians are suffering under the burden of an intolerable tyranny. But for this very reason we are diffident of their success. People may deliberate coolly and combine cautiously for the overthrow of a Government which they hate as alien or reject as uncongenial; but the insup- portable sense of wrong by making men desperate makes their counsels raslh, and leads them to dare all things and to seek any new kind of misery rather than support any longer the misery of the passing hour.
			In all their previous insurrections the Sicilians have taken counsel rather of their despair than of their prudence, and have entailed upon themselves new miseries, new misfortunes, without in the slightest degree alleviating the old. So it has been, and so it may very likely be again; it seems so obvious that the Sicilians, cooped up in an island from which there is no escape, with no neighbouring State to fly to, wvith little or no possi- bility of relief from any friendly Power, are acting with more valour than discretion in commencing an insurrectionary movement in anticipation of the time, which cannot, according to all appear- ances, be very far distant, when those troubles which seem almost ripe on the mainland may operate a diversion in their favour. It would be a grievous imputation on any Government, but it does not in the slightest degree blacken the infamy of the Government of the King of NAPs, to suppose that it may have been the object of the King's Government to drive the Sicilians into a premature insurrection. Assum- ing that of which there is no doubt--that the feelings of the Sicilians are thoroughly alienated from their KiNe, and that they have for a long time been ready to burst out into insurrec-
			tion at the very first opportuwity, we know no objection that could be urged against such a stroke of policy except its extreme wickedness, and we are quite aware what a small matter that would seem to those de- voted friends of order and religion to whose counsels the young Eing of NAPLEs appears completely to have abandoned himself. Such a policy would, on the other hand, have many ad- vantages. It would crush the resistance of one part of the kingdom before the other was ready to rise, and would give what tyrants and their myr- midons most eagerly desire-the opportunity for a terrible example. Somet!hing, also, might be gained by committing the troops to pillage and massacre and fleshing their swords in the hearts of their fellow-countrymen before time, opportunity, and the irresistible contagion of popular enthu- siasm may have shaken or undermined their fidelity. For these reasons we cannot profess to be sanguine as to the immediate result of the Sicilian insurrection. Of course, we have no information but from the Government, and that Government is not in the least likely to be guilty of the foolish magnanimity of confessing its reverses, even if it had any reverses to confess. For the moment, then, we are not sanguine of Sicilian liberty, and yet for no juster cause did patriot ever draw the sword, in no more righteous quarrel did martyr ever pour forth his blood on the scaffold. It is absurd to call those who rebel against a Government like that of the King of NAPLES revolutionists or enemies to the maintenance of order. The Government of Naples has long since ceased to dlscharge even in semblance the duties and obligations of a Government, and has long acted with aU the violence and ferocity of a Revolutionary Junta. Try it by what test you will, invent what definition you please of a regular and constituted Government, the band of conspirators againstthe public peace and happiness who dispose of the life, liberty, and property of the inhabitants of Southern Italy and of Sicily will endure no test, will satisfy no definition. Governments may go wrong by imposing grievous burdens on their subjects to gratify the sensuality, the prodi- gality, the taste for idle pomp, for architectural display, or for military parade of their Sovereigns. In all these cases they violate their duty and post- pone the interests of their subjects, which onght to be their supreme law, to their own caprices and desires. But they have still this distinguishing mark of legitimate government,-that they admit a community of interests between them- selves and their subjects, and that if that in- terest be sometimes disregarded it is an act of selfishness, and not of deliberate hostility.
			Yet even this low standard of government the rule of the Neapolitan BOURBoNs does not satisfy. We believe that they regard their subjects, not as friends whoso interests it is their duty to consider, but as enemies whose implacable
			hostility it is their duty to subdue. These miserable Princes havo learnt to think the safety of their people incompatible with their own safety. They hate enlightenment, because on- lightenment interferes with the grovelling super- stition which is one of the principal weapons of their kingcraft. They hate progress, because it teaches men to look in the acts of their rulers for some general principle instead of the arbitrary caprice of an undisciplined wilL They hate wealth, and they hate talent, be- cause each of these in its own circle is power, and they are determined to concentrate power in their own hands. A contented people are the easiest to govern, but the Neapolitan Government has long given up all idea of producing content, and believes that the next easiest people to govern are men rendered tame, servile, and obedient by a long course of tyranny and oppres- sion. As we starve wild animals to make them tame and docile, so deals the King of NArLES wvith his fellow-creatures. He makes his people miserable that they may be humble and obedient. The appearance of governing by law is osten- tatiously laid aside. D USTOI or ROBESPIERRE never laboured more ardently or more successfully to create a reign of terror. People are punished, not for the harm they have done, not for the harm they mean to do, but merely to strike terror into others. The catalogue of political prisoners was concluded the other day by the name of a man 87 years of age, who had been imprisoned for 10 years without being brought to trial, and who remains in prison still. It is aaainst such a Government that the Sicilians have taken up arms, and who can wonder at it ? We are not, as we have said, disposed to be sanguine as to the result-at least for the moment-and no one can suppose that we should wish to see this country involve herself in a quarrel with which in her political capacity she has no concern. But, though not sanguine for the present, we do not permit ourselves to despond for the future. A considerable force has been drawn off to queU the Sicilian revolt, and its absence has given occa- sion to demonstrations in Naples of the most serious and threatening nature. The train is laid and needs but a spark to set all Southern Italy in a blaze. The Kingdom of Naples has acquired a dangerous neighbour in the revolted provinces of the POPE, and the instances of successful insur- rection are too frequent and too notorious to be long kept from the knowledge even of a people so purposely seclujled from foreigners as the Neapolitan. The same interest, the same feelings, wiU unite the Italian race from the Alps to the Straits of Messina, and unless some foreign influence interfere to prevent it the King of NAPLES will soon have an opportunity of testing the fruits of his wretched policy, and learning how far those thrones are secure which base themselves on the miseries of nations.

			A paper currency is with us so established an element of civilization, that when MTr. Wrsos states the case for its introduction into India tho feeling of the British reader will be simply surprise that it should have been deferred so long. Almost any barbarism would be as intelligible as that the ordinary transfer of " treasure " from one part of India to the other, for the adjustment of the balance of trade or the payment of troops, should entail an addition of 30,000 men to the standing army. WVith scarcely less surprise do we hear that the Indian MIint is now coining rupees at the rate of 12,000,0001. sterling a-year, and that it is taken for granted that a large proportion of this money will be hoarded. Our histories and story-books tell us of Indian treasuries, deep in castles and caves, guarded by dragons or jins, accessible by an " Open, sesame," or an old lamp, and we think It very natural that such golden dreams should once have had a sort of reality in some barbarous age of tyranny pnd rapine; but that British machinery should now be at work at its utmost speed, manu- facturing day and night, from Spanish dollars or MIexican ingots, rupees destined to be buried in Hindoo fastnesses, and to figure in future tales, seems simply a mistake and an absurdity. Why should this be? Why should money go to and fro in India any more than in England ? Here, as we know, immense sums of money are flowing across the isle every day in all directions through the quiet channels of the post, and, though the work is unseen and the means impalpabl% the result is attained as effectually as if every pay- ment were made in boxes of gold and silver, con- veyed in waggons, and escorted by troops of cavalry. Unfortunately, there is nothing so easy
			as to send 1,0001. or 100,0001. to anybody any- where in this isle. It is but a strolke of the pen. Your left hand need not know what your right hand is doing; and the letter once despatched, you can neither seo nor stop the process; ssescit wox missa rcrerti. PTn=.r of 31acedon, had he lived in these days, would not even have wanted an opening in the wall large enough for an ass laden with goli A draught on a good commercial house, hidden in a shoe or a sword-hilt, would have answered all purposes. NThAusts would have given GExAZI a check on his banker, which the latter would have kept in his pocket or laid by in his desk, instead of clumsily stow- ing it away in his tower; though it must be admitted the transaction wouldc have been not the less open to investigation. All this we understand. We feel that modem usages are as handy and convenient, compared with the actual transfer of whole shiploads and caravans of the precious metals, as the lighter coin of Athens was compared with the iron currency of Sparta, or as the universal dollar is compared with cowries, rock salt, leather, and other bulL-y media of exchange. But everybody must feel it a mere oversight of the Anglo- Indian Government, and a confession of its want of enterprise, that now, in the middle of the 19th century, so wealthy and intelligent a com- munity should not have the commercial facilities that we have long enjoyed at home, and that con- tribute so much to our convenience and wealth.
			As to what is to be done, the story is soon told. Mr. WnrsoN proposes five banks of issue, with cor- responding circles or districts. For himself, he would evidently have no objection to rupee notes, but he proposes a middle course between the 51. Bank of England note and thaler note of Ger- many, and the still smaller note of Sweden and other countries. The lowest note is to be for five rupees, or ten shillings. Each bank in giving notes in exchange for coinl is to lay up at least a third of the coin in its vaults, and to invest not exceeding a third in Government securities, which will thus be withdrawn from the hands of the public. This proportion is taken from our own Bank Charter Act, and MIr. WaIroN considers that it will be at least as safe in India as at home. The note itself, rnstatis midtandis, is to be the same as the Bank of England's, both in paper, water-mark,
			and engraving, and no doubt it must for a long time baffle the ingenuity of forgers. As for the metallic basis, 3Ir. WiLsow decides in favour of the existing silver currency, which from time im- memorial has always been supposed in Indian payments. He rests on the injustice of substi- tuting one metal for another by a mere act of sovereign power, and the proved impossibility of a double standard of value. This is a point that has long been settled, and the argument is only reproduced to reconcile us to the objection that will certainly be felt to a silver currency which is to pervade a fifth of the human race, and of which the British nation is to be the guardian and manager. That they may not interfere with the new Banks of Issue, the privilege of issuing notes now enjoyed by some of the Indian banks is to be with- drawn, and Mr. Wimox informs us that they will be no great losers by the loss of it, so costly are the restrictions with which it is clogged. Side by side with the Banlks of Issue, and having the same relation to them as the banking department of the Bank of England, 31r. WiLSoN contemplates the future formation of National Indian Banks; but they are not part of the present proposition.
			It is possible that iMIr. WrLsoN may see his way to the future substitution of a gold for a silver currency, but may think it necessary at present to give no hint that may be misrepresented into a breach of faith. Of course, it is quite possible to commute engagements for silver into equivalent engagements for gold, giving, if necessary, a slight premium for the change. Unless the proposed paper currency and five district banks should almost entirely obviate the costly and dangerous carriage of coin to and fro at the call of the market or the demands of the public service, then there will stiU be a constant loss and considerable risk, through the weight of the metal. One million sterling in the shape of gold weighs about 10 tons; in silver about 150. It is true that a railway train can carry one just as easily and as quickly as the other; but the rail does not go everywhere, and the escort of the one will be more costly than that of the other. If this future saving by the substi- tution of gold for'silver can be capitalized, and given at once to the possessors of obligations in silver, they could not reasonably object to the substitution of gold, which would save all future trouble on that score. Ten or twenty years hence the change may not be so easy as now. At the present value of silver its owners are sure to be no losers by any change. This, however, is a secondary question. At home more importance will be attached to the ratio of buUion and securi- ties fixed by Air. WmsoN. That is a point v hich depends on a knowledge of local circumstances and national habits ; nor can we expect at once to hit the right proportion.

			On turning our eye to the Universities we find two important posts which have been for some time vacant, and not filled up. One is the RADCLIFFE Observership at Oxford. This important observa- tory, -which for the last twenty years has tal;en its place among the principal observatories of Europe, has been now idle for more than a year. There may be good reasons for this suspension of the functions of ahigh post of science; but, if there are, they are not such as to be apparent to the public, or therefore such as to forestall our own duty, on the part of the public, of drawing attention to it. All that is known and that is apparent is that, for no manifest cause whatever, a first-rate scientific appointment has been void a whole year, and that we have a gap in the operations of a distino,uished observa- tory. There cannot be any want of good candi- dates for the office. Our observatories train up a perpetual succession of astronomers, and as a matter of fact wve hear that there are plenty of good candidates in the present case. The weight and eminence of the names that represent the RADCLIFFE Trust forbid any unfavourable explanation of such a delay, but we may fairly appeal to the trustees themselves, as public men, and men acquainted with public feeling in this country, to say whether the vacancy of an important appointment in science for a whole year, without any manifest cause, is not a fact which ought to be noticed, and which, indeed, must be noticed.
			So much for the simple fact of so long a vacancy. If the cause of this delay, however, has been any plan in meditation for reconstructing this appointment, as rumour has suggested, we have a little more to say on the subject. If the trustees have entertained the idea, then, of uniting the RAD- CLIFFE Observership to a scientific Professorship in the University, we have no doubt they have done so for the proper object of saving the proceeds of the fund, and economizing the resources of science. We presume that the money which would have been saved by such arrangement would have been given to science, and to astronomical science, in some other shape. But, assuming that this would have been the result of such a new arrangement, we must still take the liberty of doubting most seriously the advantage of it. From everything that we hear, we represent the opinion of the whole astronomical world in saylng that the money of the RADcrrFFr Fund could not be better spent than in making
			one good whole appointment *Iih employed the entire energies of its occupant, and secured the undivided attention of one man to one subject. Another formal scientific office, in the shaDO of a University Professorship, held by the same man who held the Observership, would simply withdraw, him so far from the department of astronomy, and hand him over to another ield of work. The Observatory would only have, at any rate, half of the man ; the arrangement of a combination would not, as it might appear to do at Iirst sight, give you a whole Observer with the advantage of one- half of his salary being paid from another quarter, but the gain on the scale of salary would be balanced by a loss on the side of service, and the arrangeument would, as an economical one, neutralize itself, and issue in no gain on the whole. There is no legerdemain, in short, in the world of real work; you cannot by any adroit manceuvre make two men out of one and divide him between two offices, so as to have him whole in each. It is all honest, simple arith- metic, here; if he has two offices, two offices have him. But this is not all. As the RADcUaFFs Trus- tees have the interests of astronomy especially committed to them, we beg leave to warn them of the special risk which the astronomical half of the RADCcLiF1E Observer runs by such an arrangement. Practical astronomy is a much rarer choice as a scientific line and pro- fession than theoretical mathematics. The consequence is, that when the combined Observer- ship and Professorship becomes vacant, the candi- dates who take the direction of the Professorship are much more numerous than those who take the direction of the Observership i and, as each limb of the combination has an equal claim, the good candidate in the direction of the Professorship comes in in five cases out of six. The result is that, when appointed, he looks on the Professorship as his real office, and upon the Observership as an appendage, and an inconvenient appendage, to be treated to what spare time he can afford. The same man wvho has a taste for the theory of mathematics, and who pursues lines of thought and works out problems in this department during the day, is not the man to sit up at night observing, and oscillating between his telescope and his note-book. The two regions of science are wholly distinct, and involve different
			tastes and capacities of mind; and, as we have just said, the greater prevalence of the theoretical taste, in the case of a combination, sends the other to the wall. This is the way in which the combi- nation of the SivmANs Professorship with the RADCLIFFE Observership, as a matter of fact, operated while it existed; the Observatory. lay dormant, and it was to remedy this very bad consequence that Sir ROBERT PEEL, as the principal administrator of the RADCLLEF
			Trust, abolished the junction, and erected the Ob- servership into a whole appointment, to employ the entire energies of one man. Such an aim, of course, admits of qualifications, and nobody would wish to tie up the RADcLrFFE Observer so strictly that he could not give any spare fragments of time to other lines of experiment which would not interfere with his main task; but the combination with another formal and regular office could not work welL WVe may add that, though practical astronomy -we do not mean the light amateur amusement, but the regularbusiness-like pursuit-has compara- tively few representatives, it has more than the existing number of appointments in this department are able to satisfy. There is a want of astronomical places, and therefore we can the less afford to lose one. The taste might perhaps be developed in many more minds than it is if there were 'something like a chance of its remunerating the possessor-ifthere were a prospect of a professional post. Astronomy used to exert a very potent spell, and if Chaldee and Hindoo shepherds have felt its fascinations, and watched the starry crowd till they formed into groups and figures, and their risings and settings became the basis of astronomical calculations, an English youth with his telescope is certainly quite capable of feeling the sympathy with the upper world, and he would be more encouraged in it if he had a reasonable chance of making a livelihood by it.
			Why the other appointment to which we alluded -we mean the Regius Professorship of H:story at Cambridge, has lain so long vacant-that is to say, since August last, we cannot divine. There can be no lack of good candidates for such a post. History is the favourite study of the age; our greatest minds have devoted themselves to it; new materials are coming up everywhere ; it is the richest of all lines of research in its appeals to the imagination, the feelings, perceptions of character, and all our dramatic instincts. It has, moreover, lately been incorporated in the University system. Why, under these circumstances, has Cambridge been without a Regius Professor of History for two terms, or for two-thirds of the academical year ? It cannot be that Lord PAWEESTO?N feels no par- ticular interest in supplying the wants of his Alma Mater. Or has he too much to think of to waste his time in comparing the merits of rival candidates ? There may very possibly be a hin- drance of this kind, but it ought not to last too long, or people will be beginning to doubt the fitness of Prime Ministers to be dispensers of University patronage.

			"The aim of this memorandum Is aaid to be to establish by strategical considerations the llnimpeadhable proof that if France ever had an intention of menacing the neutrality of Switzer- land she could do so notwithstanding all the guarantee3 stipulated in the treaties of 1815, since the military road leading from France to Germany tbrongh Switzerland now no longer exists, either in the territory of Faucigny or in that o' Chablais, but at another point not included in the neutralized dis- iicts. The Cabinet of the Tuileries hopes by this to ahow that the annexation of Savoy to France does not virtually deprive Switzerland of her strategical PcstlBon, neither does it involve any of the dangers put forward beforehand by the Federal Council of Berne.

			MEETING OF REFORMERS AT
			MANCHESTER.
			On Thursday evening there was one of the most cTowded meetings ever held in the Free-trade Iall, convened by the Lancaaire Reformers' Union, to hear an address from Mr. Bright. It Is stated that not less than 15,0D0 tickets would have been distributed had there been room for so many pesons, and nearly half that number were present. Mr. George Wilson presided.
			The C wR , who was warmly cheered, made an anl- mated speech on the necessity for Parliamentary Reform, and the impediments which threatened to postpone It till another session. The Bill of Lord J. Russell, of course, fell far ahort of the requirements of the Lancashire Re- formers, but if the extension of the county franchie were its only merit, It would stil be worthy of commendation. The counties were now in a dead lock, as to progresslv, principles, in the hands of territorialproprietors. LordDerby sad that himself. Not long ago, with aU the wcelth and power of the commercial Interest of Liverpool, with all the poltical strength of iManchester, Robdale, Oldham, and other great towns included, and supportheg that which they considered right, South Lancashire was unable to return a a cotton-splnner and a Liverpool millionaire to Paraliment
			Liverpool, with all its power, its splendid works, and its great commerco, was overthrown by those obscure places, Newton-in-the-Willows and NTorth Menol, in the represen- tation; and even here in Manchester, within a stone's cast ofEthis magnificent ball, close to t'he Town-hall and the Exchange, with palatial warehouses-the finest In the world-filled with men of the energy of Einglishmen- even here the serfs of the soel were brought to vote, who, If they did not wear the badge and collar described by the great " wizard of the north," yet wore the badge of political slavery, and at the polling-boots were ticketted off- lbablled
			and accounted for just as the rent-roUl was accounted for on the day of payment. (Oheers.) According to calculations which he believed were correct the BiU would add 193,000 persons to the register In boroughs, and about 150,000 in counties. This would make a marked Improve- ment in the counties, but the measure, as a whole, was very far from revolationary. (Laugohter.) It would not "Americanize our institutions." (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) It would not disturb-it would pre- serve all our most valued Institutions. It would not quicken the pulse or touch the lawn sleeves of the bishops-the humble foUowers of the fishermen of GalUee (hisses and cheers); it had not phosphorus enough lI it (laughter) to singe the fur on the robe of a single Deer - aU our Imaginary beauties would be preserved-the heraidic lions, tigers, wolves, and foxes-for many years to come; the great Barnacles of the Circumlocution-office would bo safe; the squanderers of naval expenditure would be safe
			and the 170,0001. to the Duke of Grafton for the infamy of an ancestor would remain untouched. (Hear, hear.) He was amused at the contrast between the compliments on the hustings, and the declarations in Parliament as to the qualities of the English people. (Laughter.) Whenever a large operation on their credulity was to be attempted, they were " the most enlightened, inteUigent, loyal, and patriotic race on the earth," prepared for any amount of taxation, and to fight for anybody-Jew, Mahometan, or Catholic. But the case wasentirely alteredwhen this exclient Anglo.Saxon race demanded leave to vote. " Would they give a vote to men of no education?" Why, they forgot that the barons at Runnymede signed Magna Charta with a cross, and that Parliament, 100 years before printing was invented, passed great laws, which had come down to the present time. He was sick of this " humbug." (Cheers.) He was wel inclined towards the present Government. With Cobden as com- mercial traveller (laughter) and plenipotentiary in foreign affairs (cheers); with Bright taking the out-door dep3rt- mnent (laughter), and Gladstone and Gibson inside, the firm was doing a roaring business. (Cheers.) But if this Bill did not pass, he would say " Appeal to the country" (cheers), and he hop the result of the investigation that would foilow, would be a Bill of a very different and more effectual character. (Cheers.)
			Mr. BAZLEY, M.P., moved the folowinlg r.ssnluion
			" That this meeting Is of opinion that no mesaira o: Pari,amentary Iteform wi be attsastory to the country lesa than that which will confer the frachise on every male person rated in boroughs, or en- titled to be rated, to the poor; which wil more equally distrIbute members In proportion to popalation asd property, sand wil glee the voter the protection of the ballot.
			" Th3t the Bill now before the EHouse of Oammoes can only be re- garded as an. Int3imenet of the long-denled rights of the people, and as such this meeting hopes It may be adopted during tho pre ent sewton of Parliament, and pledges itself to afford any reasonable support to lt.y (Cheers.)
			Mr. Alderman RYLkA-Ds, of Warrington, seconded the resolution. He argued Xgainst the sonndness of Lord Ma- caulay's reasoning in the letter recently published, contend. ing that In Manchester and other populous cities there were no such hordes of Hons and Vandals aS was feared, but that our social suprstructure stood upon free men, a calm and dense mass of the popuiation. (Cheers.) Unless there were a loyal, orderly population supporting our institutions neither Acts of Parliament nor soldiery could protect them. (Cheers.)
			Mr. H. AsunwoRTy supported the resolution, which was passed unanimously, with mu ch cheering.
			Mr. BarIIT was received with immense and prolonged cheering, the whole audience rising for several minutes. He said,-MY. Chairman and gentlemen-As this is a holyday time to a large number of hard-working people, and as It is a time when those who are mo3t hard-working of al during a part of the year-namely, members of the House of Commons, are expected to seek repose in the quiet of their famUy circles, I dare say there are critics who wil ask why we should obtrude a great political meetlng upon the atten- tion of the public at such a time as this. I am one of those who are not prepared to make much of an apology to the eminently orthodox in Church and State who may object to our proceedings. I believe that it never can be inopportane that the citizens of a free country ahould meet to discuss freely those great questions which so much affect the well-being of the nation ; and therefore I venture to come to this meeting, to stand on this platform, and to speak to you honestly and faithfUlly (cheers) with regard to some topics of great public interest, to which it is well, I think, that the minds of our countrymen should be directed. We are precisely at that space of time which separates, or, if you like, which unites, the two periods of the session. We are at a halfway-house, where, I think, we may with advantage survey the past, and cast a glance, if we can, at what is in store for us in the immediate future. Looking back to she two months or more which have passed since the assembling of Parliament, I am glad to bo able to say that I think what we behold is on the whole highly satisfactory. (Rear, hear.) We have had presented to Parliament that which is a great featrre of every session-namely, the budget and financial arrange- ments of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer. If it were not for the enormous-In my ophinon, the needless (hear)-I wiU not hesitate to say the guilty, expenditure, I should be wiling to express my unmixed approba- tion of the course which the Chancellor of the Exchequer, acting for the Government, has taken. The budget can scarcely be considered apart from another great question, a great instrument in which we are deeply interested-I mean the commercial treaty between this country and France. (Cheers.) We might have had-I dare say we should have had-from Mr. Gladstone a valuable budget if there had been no treaty wvith France; but the budget has been widely affected by the treaty, and, I doubt not, is better in many respects than It would have been if that treaty had never been concluded. We must judge them to- gether as one whole matter of legislation and change now before Parhament, to the main portions of which the House of Commons has already given its assent. We thought, 1S years ago, that some of the changes that were made In the commencement of Sir H. Peel's administration were highly valuable, We have lived to see all that vast mountain of obstruction to industry almost swept away, and a tariff whose catalogue of articles was to be reckoned up by thousands is now so much cleared that, after the 400 articles are swept away this ses- sion by this budget, there remain no more, almost, than you can number upon your ten fingers. More than this, that hideons ogre against which we made war, that specious Protection, which has deceived so many and robbed so many, has not only been condemned, but has received its final punishment, and is driven for ever, I hope and would believe, from the legislation and from the practice of this kingdom. (Cheers.) We have, too, ono of the vorst duties of excise that ever was imposed, an excise on a very considerable and important manufacture-the manu- facture of paper, aboished ; and on the 15th of August next every papermaker can go round his premises without being dogged by the excisem3n, which is a hateful thing any- where, but especially hateful in a free country. (Cheers.) The French tariff has received, or is receiving, through the operation of that treaty a change more extraordinary than, perhaps, has ever taken place in the tariff of any country in thecsame space of time. That treaty comes partlylinto operation this year, partly next year, and altogether in three years; and when it comes into fnUl operation the tariff of France, as respects3this country, will be, I believe, consi- derably moreoliberal than the tariff of thu United States. Some men tell us it will be of no advantage. I wiU not pro- phesy, even in a case where prophecy might seem safe; but, If we now export to the United States to the amount of 23,000,0001. sterling in a year, how much shall we export yearly to France-a country of greater population, much nearer, and where the expenses willbe much less-when the tariff of France is more liberal than the tariff of the United States? (Cheers.) But, If this budget and this treaty be so 'rood, were they received with enthusiasm in the House of &amp;Jmmons, or in" another place " (Laughter.) No; the trea.y was received with a marked coldness in tne House of Commons; and, as you know, though under very bad tactical arrangements, it was hotly opposed by a large minority of the House. They said that it was not according to rule to have a treaty at all. Men who never stoodi on a platform to advocate free trade (hear), who never took a shilling ont of their pockets to circulate sound information upon that question, who were never foand in the hundred good men who supported Mr. VilHiers for so many years, then turned rounr, and, with a pedantry and an insolence that was almost sablime (cheers), they said that the very obiefest of the apostles otfree trade did not know his own business. (Great cheering and laughter.) They said that the French tariff was not so low as ours. Well, but we all knewthat. We did not expect the Emperor or the Government of France in a single instrument to do that with their tariff which it had ta!ken us 35 years to do. Wo did not say, became custom-houses are not abo-
			borougbs, and distribute their members mostly among the counties of England. He proposed to create four new boroughs from four of the large towns, aud give the suffrage to substantial householders. It was calculated that 99,000 new electors would be created under his BUI. He proposed further that in future, when boroughs were shown to be below a certain population, that then the country should disfranchise them, compensating their owners, and thus gradualy bring the representation to a more wholesome state. It would have been a good thing if the BiU had passed. It was rejected by the House of Commons. Two years after Mr. Pitt nogotiated a commercial treaty with France-a treaty more extensive than this, because it was a treaty not only of commerce but of navigation. Although our duties were not abolisbed, as they were now for the most part yet they were reduced to a moderate amount,and almost alS articles from England, going to France, were not to pay a duty of more than from 12 to 15 per cent. That treaty was negotiated, was ratified, and became law. It was a very liberal and a most wise measure. The Reform Bil was rejected by Parliament. The borough- mongers would not take the money that was offered, be- cause a borough is worth more than the money-it Is worth political influence; and the rotten borouchs by their infnu- ence have made half the peerages of TBnglaud. (Hear.) Therefore their owners would not surrender them on the terms of the BUI. But the treaty you know, was got rid of by a war with France. An 1793, that great war, which lasted with scarcely any Intermission for 22 years, commenced; and we stil have upon our shoulders a portion of the results of it. Now, what was the ressltof all this? The oligarchy was saved for a time - it was enriched and strengthened, but the people endured the slaughter; it was theirs to pay the taxes, to bear the degradatlon and the constantly increasing misery. Now, I want to ask you this :-Are we to see the same game repeated In the year 1860 ? WiU the House of Commons reject this Biem? Is there a party in this country sufficiently strong or sufficiently malevo- lent to drive England and France into another career of sanguinary hostilities? Do you read certain newspapers? I mentionedone to you a while ago. I mentioned it in the House of Commons the other night in no complimentary terms. (" Hear," and laughter.) I said It was a paper noted for a mixture of piety and ruffianism. (Laughter.) Well, the very next morning, so admirably did the cap fit, that the editor put it on. (Laughter.) He said that nobody could doubt which was the paper to which aUnsion had been made ; and he rebuked me for hinting at such a thing as that parties contending for the throne of France influenced by unworthy means any portion of the Press of England. (Hear, hear.) Well, I only know thatthat has been the course which aU persons contending for thrones have taken heretofore; and I have a theory that, although men will labour for years, or for their whole lives, for nothing but the reward of doing good-in doing something which Is evidently good-yet that men don't do evil for months and years for nothing. The Times newspaper, I said, folowed in the wake of the Mrorning Advertiscr, not with that same (what I call) brutal scurrility, but with a malignity, if possible, more Satanic. It is not patriotism ; it is not a love of Englishmen. You don't find article after article, thunder after thunder, peal after peal in favour of any great measuro of justice to English- men; but you do find, from week to week, and from month to month, articles of the character I have described-one day insulting France, another day alarming Germany, and ansther day exciting England. (Loud cries of " Hear, hear !") I Env that there is somethino at the ho.t+t- of
			all that which Is not patriotism. (Loud applause.) It may bo some bitter, rancorous, personal hostility, and nothing worse than that; but the consequences aro as bad as if it was treachery of the blackest and most criminal dyoc (Loud and prolonged cheering.) And in this very town yon have a newspaper which once had great Inflnence in this district. It was once in the hands of men of moro wisdom and less passion; bht in the columns of that paper, only the other day, I did see a long extract, in consDicuous type, quoted from a periodical which is said to have been started for the express purpose of providing slanders for the rest of the papers of England to quote to damage the relations between England and France. Now, of course I know precisely what will be said in answer to what I am now saying. (Laughter.) But, bear in mind I am not writing anonymously. (Cheers.) I am here with the eyes of at least 7,000 of my countrymen fixed upon me. They kmow where to find me on any day. (Cheers.) I am an Englishman like yourselves. (Cheers.) I care nothing for the revilings of the press, but I do care for the solemn in- terests of my country. (Cheers.) I ask yon,aro these warnings unnecessary? (" No !I") Are they without justification? Are your great interests to be tampered with, tram- pled as it were in the mire and blood by these anonymous writers of the press? (Cheers.) Look back for 70 years. There are the same interests against you now as then; the ame passions may be excitod. There is the same greed of power; there thethe same hate of reform; and thore is now what there was not then, we have the milary servilces grown up to unheard-of magnitude, and they form an enormous influence in the decision of questIons of peace and war. Now, nations may guide themselves through perilous crises and channels if they look back with a wilse eye to the past. I recollect an admirahle expression of a very eminent French w;riter, who was an eminent minister of Louis Philippe. He says that "A people who can understand and act upon the counsels which God has given in past events of its history is safe in tho most dangerous crlses of its fate." Have I not pointed out to you what I may call the paraUelism between tho period from 178S to 1793, and the periold in which we now live?-a Reform Bill attempted and rejected ; a com- mercial treaty with France; deeperate efforts to create war, which then succeeded, and destroyed the fruit of that noble negotiation, plunged these two empires into a war of 23 years' duration, made Europe an ensanguined battle-field, and drowned every spark of European liberty in European blood. (Cheers.) Now, I don't speak here to the Court. (A cry of " Hear, hear," and some confu- sion.) Albeit thore has been a time when the Queen and her husband wers slandered by some of these very journals, and some of you here present will recoUect when I, at any rate, on that occasion, denounced those journals, as invading with their calumnles the very sanctities of the Palace. (Cheers.) I say, I am not speaking to the Court; for my voice, honest, and unfalbering, may not be attuned to courtly ears. I speak not to the aristocracy even; for, wrapped in luxury, and in the possession of almost unquestioned power, they might not bearken to anvthing that I could say. I speak to my country- men-to the great body of the English people; for with them and for them are the blessings of peace, and on thein, if it comes, are the burdens and the sorrows of war. ("Hear," and applause.) With a few years of peace your commercial treaty may become a guarantee for a perpetual peace. Stick to it firmly noa. (Hear, hear.) It may be wrested from your hands, as it was wrested from the hands of your fathers; and another half century may pass before you again approach a friendly commercial negotiation with France. ith peace, too, the pregress of reform cannot be arrested; and power wUIl gradually and safely be transferred from a clique of families to a great nation. Forgive me iflI seem TiO teach, ornif Iseem to dare to counsel. I have given, as you know, 20 years of time and of labour to your service. Politically, I live and move and have my being only in the hope that I may advance the cause of truth, and your cause, if only bya single step. (Cheers.) Hf I tell you that peace and peaceful industry Is your path of wisdom and of great- ness-if I say that it is your taxes that are spent, your sweat which is pawned, your blood which Ts shed in war- am I the less your countryman or less loyal to my country ? (Loud cheers and a cry of " No.") If your Sunday prayer for peace be not amokery, and offensive in the sight of Heaven, then am I justified in denounciag, zs I now do heartily denounce, those who in the Parliament or in your press are striving to involve the moot potent nations of the earth in the crimes and the caamities of war. (Loud cheers,) I shall be told that I argued for peace seven years
			lished In France, that therefore we will have no commerwial dealings with that country. They said it did not come Into operation so immediately aS ours. Well, that was a dis- advantage to Francesa weU as to nus in our opinion; but we made the best of the matter by causing our own reductions to come into operatlon at once. Then they said that It had not been passed by the French Legislature, and that the Emperor had smuggled this treaty because he could not pass It through his Chambers. Well, if he paesed it according to the Constittion- of France, that, being sufficient for Frenchmen, ought to be sufficient for us (hear); and this argument rather destroys another which these men are constauntly using, when they say that the French Chambers are the creatures of the French Emeror, and dare do nothing but what he bids them do. (Laughter.) ';hen they said that In the altera- tions of oar tariff wo took off the duties from luxuries chiefly. Well, but we had not much else to take them off. (Sear, hear.) Thanks to the impotence of this party, we had in past years cleared our tariff, for the most part, of those obstructions to indastry which also im- posed taxes upon the necessaries of life ; and when we came now to abolish daties that were protective, and to admit articles from France, we were compelied to take the articles of silk and wine as being the only articles with which we could meet the fair proposition of France to open up a large and increasing trade between the two countries. (Cheers.) Bat they said, further, and The Tirnes newspaper-which has been see-sawing upon this question for the last two months-a paper that is marvelously skilful in the raising of panics and the discovery of mare's-nests (laughter)-2The Times newspaper teUs the people of Man- chester that it would have been much better if we had left it in the hands of an experienced diplomatist. Well, I know not what part Lord Cowley took in the matter, except this, that I know from the best authority that he has conducted himself with regard to it in a manner that entitles hlm to the gratitude of Mr. Cobden and of Englishmen. (Cheers.) But about this questlon of an ex- perienced diplomatist. We have had dip1omatist alU over the world, the salaries they receive are something fabulous, the expenses of their miL-ssons vary from 3,0001. or 4,0001. or 5,0004 up to 20,u001. per annum but r should look in vein through the diplomacy of England for 50 years back for any service rendered to English industy andto Englishmen comparable to the servicewhichyour old townsman, the "inexperienced diplomatist," has ren- deredto his country. (Prolonged cheering, the audlence rising.) There are men So very orthodox thatnothing reaUy can be done, because nobody is good enough to do it. (Laughter.) I have no doubt that The Times newspaper, acting upon this principle, would have protested strenuously against she teachng of Christianity by the Apostles becaHuse t.h'ey were not peers of the realm. (Loud laughter] W ell, now, I am obliged to tell you that the true reasun for the opposition which the budget and the treaty have met with has scarcely ever been touched upon in the House of Commons. The budget is disliked because it has abolished so many sources of indirect taxation to which probably Par- liament can never return, and it has tied up this grievons and apparently interminable military expenditure with the continuance of a direct tax from which the propertied elasges cannot escape. Those two things henceforth go together. It is written indelibly in tlhe condition of things in this country that henceforth, If you wiUl raise up your military expenditure from 11,000,0001. to 22,000,0001., and from 22,000,0001. to 30,000,0301., and it may be farther than 30,000,0001. next year for anything I know, that this increase must, in some shape or other, be paid by a direct tax upon property, or upon property and income combined. I think it is a most happy thing that wo have brought matters to that point. (Oheers.) I hope it will teach the rich classes of this country that it is a matter of some consequence how much we spend, and that there is not only incon- venience and irritation, but positive danger in the career of extravagance to which successive Governments have com- mitted themEelves. But the real objection to the treaty, I say, has been, for the most part, concealed. It menaces
			tre great patrimony of the taxes. It takes away, or threatens to take away, that which his been, for 170 years, almost the only cause of your incessant increase of expenditure, of debt, and of taxation. (Cheers.) It promises coniidence and peace with France, instead of perpetnal distrust and occasional war. (Cheers.) The people, I beleve, or all the honest and good people of England-and they are the vast majority-are for confidence and peace with France. There may oe, and I believe there are, a sec- tion of the English oligarchy, and many connected with the military services, who wish a diflerent policy and a different result. From the year 1690 to the year 1815 a period of 125 years elapsed. During the 125 years,from the time when the aristocracy of England becameltsomnipotent rulers until the conclusion of the last great war, 68 years out of the 125. or more than one-half of them, were years of war with France. I don't mention two or three wars with Spain, two with the United States, and numberless wars in India; I speak merely of the contests between France and England, two countries separated by a channel of water across which you may see. If you had heard that two savage tribes in Borneo had for 68 years oat of 125 maintained an almost incessant struggle for supremacy, you would have said, " What a horrible thing it would be to live among such tribes of savages !" If you had heard that the Ojibbeways and the Choctaw Indians, on the North American continent, had during 68 years out of 125 nevernonce for any long time " buried the hatchet," you would have said, " Why, those are savages; the light of civilization, the beams of Christianity have never shone there; how happy it is that we live in a country where men ore not savages, and where the destruction of each other is not their almost constant occupation In (Im- mense cheering.) When that system began your taxes were 2,000,o000. a year; when it ended, in 1815, your taxes were 72,000,0001. (" Shame a") The debt which wfas nothing to begin with, had risen in that timeto~ 800,000,0001. -a sum which you not only cannot count, but which you cannot even imnagine. And all this under a system of re- presentation in which only " the selest" voted, and in which men of your polities and mine were ostracized entirely; In which there was neltlser household suffrage, nor 61., nor 101., nor " fancy franchises," but in which the aristocratic republic of England stood supreme, uninterfered with by the rough and wholesome breath of public opinion. (Great cheering.) I have said that they are afraid that this treaty menaces thegreatpatrimonyof taxes, upon which this great aristocratic power in your country so much dependsfor promotion and for income. If France were suhmcrged, what a gain it would be for England, upon t, sysXem that has hitherto prevailed l We have spent twvice, three times, four times as much every year in nr.ra'nonts. under pretence of defending ourselves from I e, -u the whole amount of the trade between the two . es has been worth. But, if at this moment there wore no Frane, and unless Thc Times newspaper succeeded, fol- lowing, asit does, with somewhat faltering steps, in the course of the Mo-ninq Advertiser (langhter), in frightening you aboutolland, or Sweden, or Naples, or some other country, your present military expendituro of 30,000,0001. per annum could be brought down at once to 10,000,0001., or less. (Cheers.) Well, then, we propose by this treaty that France end England shall no longer bo ruinous neighbours a curse to each other, an opprobrium to civilization, to hu- manity, and to Christianity. (Cheers.) I recollect reading only a few weeks ago in that same nowsnaper, a leading article whichcommenced somewhat in this way:-"Every man knows tbat war between Great Britain andtheUnited States is a Simple imposslbility." Why? Not because tho English are less prone to Sight, or the Americans are afraid of Eng- land; no, but because we send 23,000,0001. worth a-year of the prodncts of ourmdustrytothe States,and we receive back in one shape or other, an equal amount of the products of the industry of that naton. Every ship that traverses the ocean between those two countries is doing-what ? Whv.
			It Is but weaving, as it were, a network of interests between the two peoples which pot-valiant editors (great laughter and cheering) and foolish statesmen Bre vainly endeavouring to break through. (Cheers.) And when France stands to us in the same position as America with regard to exports and imports-I wiU not say when you ex- change 46000 000!. worth (cheers), hut if you come only within a ?ew 'ears to half the commerce that now exists between England and the UInited States, then I say that we shall, by the industry of the people of the two countries, h.ave deposed for ever these bungling pretenders thatsare called statesmen, and we shaUl have enthroned the true interests and the moral sense of the two nations, which shaU preserve peace between them for evermore. (Great cheering.) But besides these questions of the budget and of the treaty, which of themselves are deserving of more ex- tended reference than time nill permit of to.nlht, there is this other question to which allusion has been already made -the question of Parliamentary reform. Weallknow that when the subject of Parliamentary reform is mentioned it presents itself to the mind's eye as a question in three branches or compartments. There is the extension of the suffrage, the opening of that door which was shut to, and screwed up in 1S32, against the working classes of this country; thereis thequestlonof thebaUot, bywbich thevote shall be made absolutely the vote of the man to whom the law says It belongs (cheers) ; and thirdly, there is tbe apportion- ment of members in some degree in relation to the popula- tion and the property of the districts by which they are to be sent to Parliament. Every one will perceive at once that whatever the Bill of Lord J. Russel does with regard to the suffrage, it does nothing with regard to tho baUot, and almost next to nothing with regard to the distribution of seats. Well, then, let us take it as it is, let us not for a moment conceive it to be a Reform Bili in the sense in which we have been accustomed to use that term, but that itis a Bill for the extension of the suffrage, and ln'thatli"ht only it ought to be considered. I tell you, very franiay the reason why the distribution of seats is so lightly touched that the very fringe of that question has scarcely been dis- turbed. You must bear in mind that aU the Cabinet are not enthustastic reformers. (" Hear," and laughter.) I know nothing about It (laughter) except what I judge from what I see, and the occasional observations that pass to and fro in the atmosphere of the House of Commons. But I dare say, if one knew all about it, that Lord J. Russell may have had just as much difficulty in passing his Bill through the Cabinet as he may expect to have in passing it through either House of Parliament, I have no authority for this statement, but I am looking only at the antecedents of some of his colleagues; and tbough I dare say they have judged It desirable that such a Bill should be introduced, they would have been very glad if it had not been necessary. (Cheers.) But suppose that Lord J. Russel had acted upon the advice which I have more than once taken the liberty to offer to him, with great submission, upon this question; suppose that the Bill had been merely a suffrage Bill, and had not touched the ques- tion of the distribution. You would have had Mr. Disraeli rising with a face of the extremest gravity (laughter), and he would have said that hethought " that on a question of this nature the House ought to be in poesession of the whole scheme of the Government. You propose here certain changes with regard to the suffrage, but it is well known that these who ask for reform ask for certain disfranchise. ments, and the enfranchisement of new boroughs, and so forth." And I should not have been in the least surprised if some resolution had been submitted to us, and some simple, or perhaps not over honest member on our side might have been induced to undertake it, which would have ex- pressed the opinion of the House that it ought to be in possession of the whole scheme of the Government with re- gard to reform, before It proceeded to discuss the measure which Her Majesty's Ministers bad laid upon the table. Well, I have no doubt that, with the honest intention to do
			;rlat the circumstances of the case vozld admit of, this Bill _as been pre1pared and submitted to Parliament and the counnlr, IsaU only ask your attention to one point of it, because as to the quesion of the cornty franchise, seeing that it was proposed in the last sentoyn tn a very clumsy way, by Lorl Deby's G-overnment, I 'on't suppose that as a united party, his suopoiter can 6 n the Hous e of Coimons mnake any attack upo6n that clause. You observe, from the speeches that have been m akig,- for although they have not opposed the second reaing so far there ha been a constant dropping fire almost every night on this manure,-thattho the n ichithe profes
			to ha shocled is that men asing 61. hoses alsould be en. titled to vote for members ofParament. The chairman has given you some figures with regard to thhs,which are not strictly correct according to the rtuorns the Government have laid before the House. Those returns don't show so preat an increase as Mr. Wilson has calculated, and I am inlned to think the returns are right. At present, In all the boroughs in England and Wales there are 440,000 names upon the register. Of these nbout 40,000 are freemen, and scot and lot voters, but we will call them ar
			440,000t Now this Byi, according to the Government return, will yad 167,000 names to these 440,000" . The question I want to put to you Is this,-Is that a dangerous prepositionm? Is It lk-ely to overturn anything that any- body wantstokee on its legs? (Laughter.) Is it likely, do you think, toagve to " an Ignorant and excited mob"7-- those are the polite terms in wic h they speak of the great bodyi of the workdn- men of England-a preponde- rating power through s the boroughs of England, and to reduce Parliatent to that kind of desperate condition which these gentlemen picture as the result of pasing this Bill? Some of them propose to go up to e1. What would h1. add? It would add just 38,000. ( aughter.) Why, that is not mor a than about five times as many people as there are In this meeting to be added to all the constitusensies of Englanld and Watles. And that they would call a repre- sentation of the working classes, although we all know that for any man who may he called strictly of the working classes that would be admitted at the 611. there would be at least another maan who cannot strictly be called of the work-Ing classes that would be omitted. If they go to 71. It wouald admit 95,000; if to 61., as is pro- posed, it will admit 167,000. Now, an hon. friend and relative of mine the member for Hluddersfield (cheers), in a speech en t6i very question In the House gave us a very interesting fact. Some friends of his had made an exert calculation in Huddersfield as to the number that would be, strictly spea.king, of the working men, receiving wages every week or fortnight, and these who would not be, out of the new,lyenfranchised in Huddersfield. Iit sa town where you know, manufactnres are the life of the place, andwAere the ~working men, as they doin all these towns, live in very great numbers. They found that out of the whole of the new constituency there more then one- fourth could not, upon any sort of just phraseology, be termed of the working classes. Well, then, if you take one-fourth, or a little more, from these 167,000, yen will find that not mere than from 100,000 to 120,000 of the strictly working men of Bugland and Wales would be ad. mitted to the franchise in all the boroughs if this great Bill became law. (Hear, hear.) Recoliect iUa 'we are In the year 1860. In the year 1781 Mr. Pitt, the " Hleaven- born AMinister," you recoilect, the man who " weathered the storm," after doing a great deal to raise It (laughter)- Mr. Pitt himself prpoasee a Reform Bill, and, for the time too, not a had Bill. He proposed that substantial householders, in those boroughs that theni existed, &amp;,d in some new ones which he intended to make, should be the electors. Well, that is a franchise quite a~s extensive as that which is now proposed. But in 1797 Lord Grey (then Mr. Grey) and Mr. Fox proposed a Bill to enact that house- holders should have a vote. In 1832 Lord Darham, a great authority at that time, proposed also that household suffrage
			shiould be the franhitse ; and the ancient franchise of the boroughs of England and Wales, centuries ago, was un- doubtedly conferred upon aU the householders in those boroughs. Now, the Reform BUt of 1832 excluded that, and limited the franchise to 10t. Bet It has always been Drotested against.Vast nuinbers of those who were admitted were dissa- tisfied, and, of course, al these who were excluded were not contented. Lacghter.) There has been 30 years of protest. It has been a main cause of the agitations for reform which have existed since the Reform Act, and we have had pro- misee of Government after Government-and no promise more emphatic than the promise of Lord Derby's Govern- ment when it was in extremis-that the working people should be admitted to the franchise, and if admitted they should be admitted truly and generously. (Oheers.) Now, if you have read the speeches of the gentlemen who have opposed this Bill in the Honse of Commons you wiU find that they consist chiefly of arguments that have been supplied to them by the leaders of T7e Times. (Laughter.) The principal argument is this, that you wti admit so many of a class acting by itself, unconnected wvith any other class, that they wil swamp aU the existing constituencies, and that some dreadful thing not fit to be called a respectable Parliament will hereafter sit in St. Stephen's. (Laughter.) In 1832 they said just the same thing, as Mr. Rylands has explained to you. But lf we look to the present borough constituencies we shaU find that one-third consists of house- holders between 101. and 151. ; and far more than half con- sist of householders under 251. a-year. But we never heard of all those between 101. and 151. conspiring against the people who live In houses above 504, or of those between 101. and 2514, who are much more than half the constituency, conspiring to retura an unsuitabie mnember of Parliament, and to swamp the rich bankers and merchants and manufacturers and persons of great property and great education. No such thing has ever taken place. And that dream, wild as It was in 1832, was not more wild than the dream which we now hear of, the calumny not more insulting or more untrathful than the calumny now uttered against that considerable bodv of the workin classes who bythls Bill are to be admitted to thefranchise. (Cheers.) They say that this class of persons-61. to 101. householders- are opposed to our institutions. Well, we have had some quotations about Macaulay. (Eear, hear.) I recollect, In the discussion of 1832, Mr. Macaulay said, in answer to that:-" What a charge this Is against yoar institutions ! Is it against the Crown, or the Lords, or the Church? What is the institution which all the Pelpie that you are to give votes to by this Reform it are against?" It does not say much for the value, for the working, for the advantageconferred by these institutions If you can find 167,000 men living in houses between 6!. and 101. who wil immediately use the political power conferred upon them to pull down and destroy these institutions. (Cheers.) But they tell us another thing. We had a very long speech on t.his Point from Mfr. Whiteside. He is an Irish lawyer (hisses), and member for the University of Dublin. He had nothing very apt to say on the question, because what he had to say would have very much unsaid what he said last year (laughter); thereforehe-I wasgoing tosay " interested," only he did not (laughter), for it was not near so lively as if it had been something original from himself; but he at- tempted to interest the House by reading the main
			artion of a pamphlet on the subjeet of the late Builders' Strike in London; and he showed what dreadful fellows those masons and carpenters and bricklayers andnmasons'labourers are. (Laughter.) Well he did not appear to remember that all this class of persons who live in houses so as to be enfranchised under this Biil have now the franchise in the metropoltan boroughs, and one has never heard of any great harm that they have done there, because I believe the metropolitan members, in there attention to the businesss of the House, in the regularity and fidelity of their votes, are not exceeded by any other class of members returned to the House of Commons, But it Is too bad, and I protest against the House of Commons, especially Mr. Whiteside and his friends, blaming the working men because they have trades' unions. It has never yet bean proved that trades' unions, or that strikes, are always bad. (Loud cheers.) I dare say, In nine cases out o ten, or, it may be, for aught I know, in 99
			oIL os iuu, a semee wolua nave oeen oesrer avoiaea. .us a strike is the reserved power, and, if I was a working man I should never say that I should surrender my right (cheers), in combination with others, to take such steps as are legal and moral for the advancement of my interests and the interests of those who worked with me. But, if these strikes be sometimes, or often, or mostly bad-and that, I think, all classes of persons, in allproba'olity, would agree to-still the House of Commons and Mr. Whiteside's party are not the persons to upbraid the workingmen with whatthey do upon this matter. The House of Commons was itselE a great trades' union froml815 to 1846. (Cheers.) You know what was the shibboleth of county members,- "wheat at so much, barley at so much, oats at so much;" and, as one of them wished to be minute in the profession of his faith-one of the members for the North Ridig of Yorkshire-he was for establishing a proportionate price for new-milk cheese. (Laughter and cheers.) Now, we com- bined against this system; we " struck." (Laughter.) Why nature herself, constant and beneficent as she always is -natsre *' struck" against this inhuman system; the very harvest rotted in your fields; and, as tn old time the houdmen of EgypJt were liberated by means of the plagues oE Ept, so famine, fever, and an exodus greater than that which Moses led were necessary, and came and succeeded in strik-ing off the manacles from the industry of the people of this kingdom. (Great cheering.) MIr. Rylands has referred to the state f opinion in the House, and the manner in which this Bil istreated. I have seen more of It than he has seen, probably. I hope he wiUl come there some day and see it. (Cheers.) And my opinion is that Mr. Dlsraeli, and probably some others of his colleagues, would be glad even that thts Bil should pass, and this question, so far as may be, should be put out of the way, and not obstruct their battles with their old antagonists, the Whigs. But the Tory party is evidently somewhat divlded upon it. That party is not so obtuse as it used to be; It is not so united in resisting everythIng, and there are members, Intelligent and moderate in the{r views, who would he very glad, I believe, to see this Bil
			passed. What they will do, when the strain of party obli- g ations upon them, I know not, but I think, in their hearts, they would wish this very moderate measure chould succeed. Behind the Government there sit some men who go by the name of " Old Whigs ;" somo of them are caUed
			' Old, old Whigs." (Laughter.) They are very good men, as things went 30 years ago, but they don't appear to have made much progress since that time. I would not speak of them with irreverence, remembering how much the: people of this country owe to the party to which they are sincerely attached. They are somewhat afraid of this Bill, for they have got now to that time of life that they are afraid of almost everything which they have nlot looked at from their childhood. (Laughter.) But there are some Liberals, who are not Tories and not Whigs. but who sit down at our end of the House. Some say that the Bill is not enongh, and therefore abuse it whenever they have an opportunity, and Eome would ik-e it a little different one way or another, I have been long enough in the House of Com.mons to find out that it is very difficult to get any measure just to your liking ; but I am so anxious to go on somewhat, and to give thepeople a feeling of confidence in Parliament and in Go- vernment-to open a door by which multitudes of good men who are now excluded may come in, or hope to come in- thart I don't look at this BiUl, examining every particular word of it, so as to discover where I can find fault with it, or where I can give myself an excuse for opposing and for cia- maging it. (Elea.) I am rather willing9 to give credit to the (Government for what they have offered, and to urge them in an honest spirit to take care that it is made no worse in its passae througsh Parliament. Let this session boe memorable at least for thi-that the
			wall of partiton is thrown down; that we ara no longer two nations in this laud, but one nation, united by one interest, acting under the same constitution and the same laws, made for us all by those who do, to a snore con. siderable extent than at present, represent us alL goud cheers.) Some of our opponent. say that 'here is no danger now in throwing out this Reform BiM; that the Deople don't came about it, that they will not have it, that it is not enongh for them, and that there- fore they will not fight for it. The very moderate men never fight for anything (laughter); and therefore it is said, "We may do just as we ioke with the BilL" These men-these political simpletons (langhter)-are looking forward, I suppose, to a time when you wil have two or three deficient harvests, deficient cotton crops, bad trade all over the country, great excitement, and great anger. They want to widen the gulf that separates classes-to deepen it now. They think that hereafter they can bridge it over and heal up all the wounds and diseases which their present con- duct may canse, I say that this Is not states- manlike to the country,-that it is not loyal to the Sovereign,-thatbit is not safe for the interests of aa reat and populous nation like this; and I will have no part in a policy like that. (Loud cheers.) The working classes ar mo- derate; theyare not desirous of tumult; they wouldwish that Parliament should give that to justie which may, sometime or other,be extorted from their fears. But I warnthese gentlemen against the policy they arepursuing. They askthe great body of the unenfranchised to come to the door ; they open it a little, give them just a glimpse inside, and admit a very few select men picked out some way or other, and then alamthe door in thefacesof therest. (Cheers.) I say that that is not a wise course, and that if it be pursued, there is an opposite com-se which it will behove the working classes to take. They have petitioned long enough; they havepro- claimed their grievances. The remedy has been prom by successive Governments, and the Monarch from the Throne has uttered over and over again from her lips that the char- ter of England's liberty was about to be extended to a wider circle. I say, if Parliament thus chooses to shut that door in the faces of the working men, the course I would advise them to take is this:-Theyhave tradeslunlons,they havesocieties multifarious all over 'he country in all the boroughs. I would have the leading men of all these societies to meet. I would have them for one twelvemonth-longer would not be nocessary-appomnt delegates from every society to take steps by which the opinions of this g,reat extruded mass should be known, and by which they would tell Parliament t,hat, while they are perfectly calm and perfectly tranquil, and will continue so before the law, that stil they do not in- tend to be put off with pretences of one kind and another, and baffled and cheated for ever of the just expectations which have been held out to them. (Great cheering.) I mentioned that the treaty was looked on with coolness by a large party in the House of Commons. It was the up- rising of the commercial classes throughout the kingdom that gave the great majorities in favour of the budget and of the treaty. Neither of them were liked any more than the Reform Bill is liked. Now, the treaty, though it is passed, may stiU faU of its effect, and the Reform BiU may fall to be passed through Parliament. Let me point you to a parallel case In the history of this country-a parallel of a remarkable and most instructive charaoter. I have said that, In 1784, Mr. Pitt brought in a Reform BilL As a curiosity, compared to what we are doing now, I will state one or two of its provisions. He proposed as the easiest way of getting rid of the rotten toroughs, that the country shold buy them from their owners; that is, pay them certain compensation if they could persuade them to give them up. The Bill proposed to buy up 36 of these

			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Slr,-I have read several lettern in your columns objecting to my balance-sheet. I have long since ceasel to expect that T can convince people against their will. When I pub- lished my first balance-sheet, showlng an apparent losla everybody believed in it, and agriculture rejolced, lNo,
			that the fruits of Improvement have resulted in a goo4 profit, agriculture Is unhappy and full of disbelief.
			I am not surprised at this, becauso the history of pra- gress has ever been one of warfare against oldaestablisbed prejudices. I shall nevertheless continue, by every men in my power, to stimulate ournatlonalagriculturalim- provement, imowing that in so doing I am supported (anda
			great comfort it is) by the good wishes and approbation of vise and thoughtful men.
			We certainly ehould all regret that in this age of intel- lectual progress so many can be found who doubt the neces- sity for, and profit of, such investments as the drainage andi deeper cultivation of our wet, stiff, cold clays, the better shelter for our live stock, the economic n of steam machinery, and many other things whir.
			cannot be carried out without a considerable invest. ment of capital. The miserable condition of our vast ex. panse of those clays (15-16ths of which, accordlng to Mr. Bailey Denton, are still undrained), is painfully visible frout every line of railway, binding the tenants in porerty. humility, and discontent; and yet I am told over and over again by such practical men, " Water won't go through our soil."
			I pass freqnently by a stiff-clay undrsined farm whhich has had five tenants in five years, and has either ruined or Impoverished every one of them, and yet the ono remedy wanting-deep drainage-is stil unapplied. Seelng, then, a multiplication of such apathy or miscalculation on the part of landlord or tenant, or both, am I to be blamed for awakening public attentlon for such sins of omission, so de- trimental to the community at large ?
			My conscience tells me that I am not to blame.
			I can, therefore, afford to pass by without anger the petty nibblings of fractional or prejudiced objectors.
			I do not consider it necessary to vindicate the generzl truthfulness of my statements.
			I am. Sir. vour obedient servant.

			Co-srv mos OF ScoTTisEs ROYAL BDuns.-The annual meeting of the Convention of the Royal Burghs of Scotland was held at Edinburgh on Tuesday and Wednes- day, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh presiding. On the motion of Mr. Duncan M'Laren, it was resolved that the Convention instruct the Annual Committee to petition ire favour of the Bill now before Parliament for extending the franchise In connties to occupiers of 101., and in burghs to ocnupiers of 6l1 rental, and at the same time to urge the claims of Scotland to a larger proportion of members, on the ground that, whether as regards population or taxation, or both combined, it is at present in- adequately represented in coimarlson with England ansd Ireland. In closing his speecn Mr. M'Laren said there was a new argument which he had that day heard urged bya friend in favour of an increase of Scotch mem- bers, and that was the good It would do both to England and Ireland. Hs friend had looked over a return of aU the petiltons to Parliament alleging bribery and corruption at elections since the passing of the Roforna Bil3, and he found only five of these petitions emanatlng from Scotland, wbile in one year 95 bad been sent in from other parts of the United Kingdom, and in every new Parliament there were from 50 to 60 sent in. The fair inference was that therm was far more downright honesty exercised in giving votes in Scotland than in England, and the effect of giving more seats to Scotlandwould be to give amore healthy tone to tho constituencies and the representation of the UnitedlKingdom. The motion, which has been annually carried for a number of years, praying Her Majesty to appoint a Scretary of State for Scotland, was on this occasion negatived by 27 to 22. The provost of Kirkealdy remarked that the creation of such an office would be a clear waste of the public money - for if Scotland required a Secretary of State for itsehlf England, with six times the population, would require sx, and Ireland would need at least two. The Convention re- newed its annual petition for a reduction of the duty on fira insurance. It was agreed to instruCt the Annual Committee to petition in favour of any Bill which might be Introduced into Parliamentfounded on thereport of the Comnisrion on Roads in Scotland.

			FOREIGN INTELLGECE; I
			FRANOE.
			(FROM Ou1R OWN CoiBEsPoND'Mr.)
			[A portfon of the followlng appeared In our econd edition of ste!d..-1
			PARIS, THursDAY, APRI 12, 6 P. r.
			The MonieurT continues t* publish addresses to the Emperor of the French from various districts of Savoy, breathing the most eanest desire for annexa- /don to France. Not much variety 13 observable in thesa domestic products, and one may detect in their fine sentiments the same " fine Romanhand."
			The precursor~ sent many months ago to Savoy i:o prepare this "1 spontaneous " burst of annexation enthusasm appear to have well executed their mis- slon. The Monifeur announced eight or ten days ago that 3L Auselme Petetin had got the Cross of the Legion of Honour. M. Anselme Petetin is the writer who published a pamphlet in August last advocating annexation. The same honour will, doubtlees, be conferred on a fair proportion of
			the signers of the addresses. Yet, in spite of these agents, the annexatfon might hava been doubtful but for a hint that, if the Piedmontese Govern. ment did not fulfil its engagements within a spedi- fled time, the French army of Lombardy would occupy Florence. The drama wll exhibit more of the piquant before it reaches its dnouemene. The popular will is to be consulted, and the annexation submitted for approval to the Piedmontese Parlia- ment. Does any one suppose that, after the addresses with lists of signatures that appear in the Momiteur, and the occupation of the country by French troops, much regard will be paid to the " popular will," or even to the decision of the Turin Chambers? WVhy is the ordinary course, first consulting the people and then seeking the ratification of the Chambers, pre- vious to occupation, inverted?
			The feeling excited abroad by these things is not unnoticed. However the journals may rejoice at the enthusiasm of the Savoyards, and sneer at the hardihood of Switzerland standing up for her neu- trality, there are some misgivings as to the real dis- position of foreign nations. M. Thouvenel has 'thought it his duty to give assurances to those Go- vernments of the moderation and friendly intentions of the French Government. The consequence, I fear, is, that thefeelingof uncertainty which existed before baa since then increased; for, justly or unjustly, the more these Governments hear of moderation, the more they apprehend that the contrary is meant. The affair touching the Helvetic Confederation has produced a certain disquietude (however dissembled) in Austria, uneasiness in Germany, and irritation in Switzerland; what it has produced in England it is needless to say. This is so dearly seen, that it has been thought necessary to put forth zome state- ments in order to tranquilize the public mind abroad. The ordinary channels for the circulation of these statements say that the Swiss Confedera- tion is perfectly satisfied; that a certain portion of territory on the southern shore of the Lake of Geneva is to be added by France to the neutralized provinces, which, however, remain with her on the same conditions as they were with Piedmont; that, according to the Nord, "an Envoy Extra- ordinary of the British Government has pro- ceeded to Berne, and, in an interview with the Prezident of the Federal Council, expressed the opinion that Switzerland ought to content herself with the recent concession of the French Govern- ment, which augments by some kilometres, on the left bank of the Lake of Geneva, the extent of ter- ritory already neutralized," and that in Switzerland public opinion is most favourable to these arrange- ments.
			Of the truth of this I can say nothing. That the Imperial Government will have it3 way, and that Switzerland must submit, is very probable; but I am positively assured that the Swiss Legation in p?aris has received no information on these matters, either from its own Government or from the French Foreign-office.
			The Director of the Bureau of the Press at the Home-office declares, I am assured, that he is not the manager of the Patrie and (J7ondituionnel, as statea. I, of course, accept as true this declaration made in his behalf. In order, howrever, that the public who read the Patrie may not in future refer its blunders or its misstatements to his department, I would suggest that the denial of his not being the manager, and of having no connexion or control over it, should be published in an official or semi- official paper. This would remove the error from the minds^of the public. It would also, I have no doubt, relieve the Minister of the Interfor himself from the annoyance of having such statements as those, for instance, which accuse England of getting up Carlist rebellions in Spain, &amp;c., attributed to his department, or to any branch of it. I repeat that I accept the denial given on behalf of the Director, but, unless something like what I suggest be done, the public who read the Patrie, and are simple enough to believe it, will know nothing about the matter.
			Accounts from Brest announce the departure of the frigates Sibylle and Isis for New Caledonia. The frigate Bayonnaise is being prepared for sea at Cherbourg-her destination iB the Pacific Ocean. The corvette Artemise and the brig Agile are about to sail from the same port to protect the French fishermen in the North Sea. The gunboat Comete, built by M1. Armand, of Bordeaux, for the conveyance of troops, has arrived at Brest. She mounts four guns, and can accommodate 1,000 troops. Her ulterior destination is not known. The steam-frigate Vauban has sailed from Toulon for Genoa.
			The principality of Monaco, which it is said is about to be annexed to France by virtue of a con- vention concluded with the reigning Prince, was Eounded by the Emperor Otho, m the year 968, in favour of Count Grimaldi, whose descendants possess it at present. This dynasty Is consequently one of the oldest in Europe. The reigning Prince, who bears tao title of Charles III., was bo in France in 1828, and remained here nAtil the death of his father, in 1S64. He was known by the name of Duke de Valentinois, and married the Princess Antoinette de Merode. The Prince of Mlonaco passes the winter at his palace at Mlonaco, and in the summer he inhabits the magnificent chateau of Mar- chais, in the Department of the Aisne, the ancient residence of the Dukes de Guise, which he pur- chased from Count Achille Delamarre for 1,800,000f. It is stated that the Prince is to be created a French Senator. His father,and grandfather were peers of France.
			A letter from Nice of the 8th inst. announces that at 5 p.m. last Saturday afternoon the National Guard relieved the Sardinian troops posted at the Villa de Orestes, inhabited by the Empress Dow- ager of Russia. All the other military posts in the city wero subsequently given up to the National Guard. The military band of the 2d French Regi- ment of Chasseurs performed in the public gardens that day. A great number of the inhabitants of Nice followed the military band throutgh the streets, crying, " Vire lt France r' " Vive V'.Ernpercur !"
			I have received the following letter from Bucha- rest, dated April 3:-
			" There have been several debates in our Chamber since It was constituted, of which the object was partlcularly to blame the Ministry for the erroneous interpretation they attached to the convention, and for having illegally in. fluenced the elections.
			" The Minister of the Interior was beaten on every ques- tion, and no v finds that he does no' command the majority he expected.
			" It was reported that the Minister of the Interior had resigned, but nothing coultd be more erroneous. On the contrary, he clings tenaciously to office, and, thanl;s to bis intimacy with M. VasilliM Aloxandri, who pases for his protector with Prince Couza, he may! maintain himself for a long time In his place; end, indeed, niobody woulcd be sorry if he did so, if he would employ his administrative talents judiciously and impartially.
			" Ir:nce Couza has been for the Ils three days at Jassy, where public affairs give him more tronble than those of Wallachia. The Government has committed so many acts of nepotism in aloldavla and the Prince has placed so many of his friends in office that he has provoked a coalition of the chiefs of parties-Gregory, Stourdza, lavoyent, Pano, &amp;-c.-and a very serious opposltion has been organized oven ag,inst the person of Prince Cooan."

			SARDINIA.
			(FROB&amp; OUR Ow2 COBBEPOTDENT.)
			TURLN, ApRm 10.
			I am aware how sick every English reader must be of the question of Savoy and Nice. I know how loth every sensible being is in a stirring commu- nity, to dwell upon or revert to evils past cure. But the sacrifice of those two provinces, and especially of Nice, is attended with such aggravating circum- stances that the press can never be too minute in its particulars.
			The Provisional Governor of Nice, Lubonis, has put forth a manifesto by which the feelings even of the most apathetic persons in this country have been outraged.
			The King, In his speech, says he has "stipulated" a treaty. Stipulxted, in Italian, is not condluded; and in the same breath, in fact, His Majesty in- forms us that the negotiation is stilL subordinate to " the suffrage of the people" and " the consent of the Parliament." Before any appeal to the people or any discussion in the Chamber occurs the King withdraws his troops and his Governors, and Savoy and Nice are invaded by the French soldiery. All this we underatand,-right is of no avail against might. Piedmont cannot go to war with France. The Emperor decrees not only that the two pro- vinces should be invaded, but also that the King's word should pass away; and the provinces and the King's credit may be lost without repimng, so we have it at least in our power to ahow that we yield to overbearing force alone.
			But the flagitious part of the transaction is yet to come. The Piedmontese functionaries are recalled from Chambery and Nice; the King-we do not see by what fatality compelled-consents to prolong the .exercise of sovereign sway in those trans-Alpine dis- tricts. He does not say to his ally, " Tak-e the two provinces, and do with them na you think fit ;" he does not hid the new ruler to send his own offlicers to administer the Duchy and county in his name -to go, as he lists, through the vain mockery of a popular vote. He consents to do the dirty work himself to the very last. He appoints new Gover- nors-Savoyards in Savoy, Nizzards in Nice, " that the wishes of the population may not be said to be biassed by any extraneous influence." Lubonis is a Nizzard-a man of honour, known for his upright character. The two other persons making up a triumvirate with him are, indeed, notoriously attached to the French interests; but Lubonis is neutral; nothing but fair play are we to look for- ward to under his auspices.
			And nowhere we have Lubonis's proclamation:- " All uncertainty as to oar destinies is at an end. By a treaty of the 24th of March last the valorous King Victor Emmanuel has given up Savoy and the territory of Nice to France. Bat the fate of a people must not be the exclusive result of the Sovereign's wifll. The magnanimous Emperor Napoleon and the loyal Victor Emmauuel have expressed a desire that the treaty of cession should ba made valid by the PoPular consent."
			So far so well; but now. for the sequel:-
			" Before the august word of the King all uncertainty as to our f atore Is dispelled. All opposition must break and become powerless against the interests of the coantry aad the feeling of duty. Nay, more, it would meet with an insuperable obstacle in the very wishes of Victor Emmanuel. Let us bhsten to confirm with our votes the annexation of our country to France ; let us become the echo of the intentions of the King; let us rally round the standard of that great and noble nation which always commanded our sympathies; let us range ourselves round the throne of the glorious Emperor Napoleon III.; let us surround it with the fideUty characteristic of our country-the fidelity of which, up to this day, we have given such luminous proofs to the dynasty of Victor Emmanuel."
			Thus, after an appeal to the people's loyalty to induce - them to fall off from their allegiance, drowning thus the kid in its mother's milk, the Provisional Governor goes on with more in the same strain, and the proclamation ends-" Vixa la francia! VIiva l'Imperatore Napoleone III."
			I wish I could convey to you the twentieth part of the alarm and disgust this offical effrontery has created among the people here,even among those who swear by Cavour. "Whyexposethecountryto such gratuitous indignity ?" I hear repeated on all sides. In the meanwhile, the vote in Savoy and Nice is to come off on the 22d, and, as I have aU along been surmising, the Minister wiU con- trive to dodge the Chamber of Deputies for these three or four days, and only allow the discus- sion, if any take place, to be brought forward after the King's return from Central taly, vwhen few men will have perseverance enough to rake usp an incurable grievance, and wihen, if anything like a serious ou?tcry is set up, the " only possible" MIinister will silence his adversaries by making thhe approbation of the Treaty of Cession a "Cabinet question."
			TURIN, AwaRIL .0.
			SAIRDINIAN PARLIAMENT-HOUSE OF DEPUTT:ES,
			(Signor Zanolini, Senior Vice-President, in the chair.)
			The sitting opens with a crowded House; every- thing bespeaks the strong interest universaUy taken in to-day's proceedings. There is a numerous at- tendance in the gaUeries. Cavour, Farini, Mamiani, and most of their colleagues at an early hour occupy their places round the Ministerial tables. Some of the members of the extreme Opposition, esneciaUy Cattaneo, Sirtori, Guerrazzi, &amp;c., have nover yet made their appearance since the opening of Parlia- ment. Garibaldi is in his place, beside his friend Laurenti Robando.
			The business of the day is the choice of the per- manent sewgio, consisting of a president, four vice-presidents, six honorary secretaries (there were four, but the House decrees that there shall henceforth be six,besides many paid clerks), and two qu2stors.
			The election tak-es place by secret vote. First comes the choice of the president, by itself; then the various functionaries of the oflice by batches, ac- cording to their degree. The deputies are, by an eppel iomi,ol, called to lay their schede, or written votes, in the urn. The schedules are then talsen out by the senior president, ons by one, counted, and read aloud.
			The result of the first vote was as foUows:- voters, 218; absolute majority, 110 (or half the number of voters and one). Of these 94 votes were for the Mlinisterial candidate, Lanza; 68 for Ratazzi, the candidate of the Opposition; 44 for Buoncompagni, who had, however, declared in aU the papers that he withdrew from the contest; 6 votes feU to Minghetti, Cavour's factotum in the late revolutionary crisis; 2 to Cabella, the elo- quent Genoese advocate ; 1 to Garibaldi; 1 to Gual- tario, the historian. There was one blank vote and one was annulled. As none of the candidates had attained the absolute majority (which in this case was, as I have said, 110), it was neces- sary to proceed to a second vote. The first and second experiments are called "free votes," as every deputy is at liberty to give his suffrage for any candidate he likes. If these two votes lead to no definitive result-that is, if in both experiments neither of the candidates obtains the absolute ma- jority-then the Chamber proceeds to a " close vote, " or balnotaqgio, in which the contest lies exclu- sively between the two candidates who obtained the greatest number of votes.
			In this case a second free vote was tried- the voters were 219-absolute majority, 110. For Lanza, 129; for Rattazzi, 67; Buoncompagni had 20 votes; Cabella, 1; one vote was blank, another vas set aside as void. Consequently Lanza was declared to be duly elected president.
			The vice-presidents were then elected. Each member deposited in the urn a schedule, on which the names of four candidates were inscribed. The voters wrere 212-the absolute majority, 107. One only experiment w;as needed. The 3!inisteri21lparty ,
			or majority of the House, had aged upoh Touri candidates, who should represent the varous pro- vinces lately annexed to the kingdom. These were, Tecchio, a Venetian, representing Lombardy; Mal-
			mus, of MIodens; Minghetti, of Bologna; An- dreucci, of Tuscany. The votes feUl out as fol- lows :-Andrecci, 164- Minghetti, 156; Tecchio, 155; Aalmusi, 133. TAo othervotes were dispersed amongst other candidates. The four named were de- clared to have been elected vice-presidents.
			It will be easy to perceive how dull and tedious the work of these elections must prove, if I say that tho choice of a president and, vice-presidents took up the whole of to-day, sitting from 1 to half-past 5. To-morrow we shaU waste as much time for the secretaries and qunstors; and be it observed that there wvas not a man in or out of the House who was not aware that these audno other men had been agreed upon by the Government and the immense majority devoted to it as their candidates, so that all free and close votes wero reduced to a mere vain ceremony. So it is, however; the Italians have Ncl inoculated with French pedantic formalism, and the first month of a Parliamentary session, or not much less, must elapse ere either the deputies or the senators proceed to anything like real business.
			Something like a sensation was created by L,aurenti Robando, Garibaldi's FidusZ, ACItateS, who complalned that the minutes of his election, which were sent to Turin by post by his constituency (one of the "colleges" of Nice), had never arrived, so that his election could not be approved, ad he was empowered neither to speak nor to vote "now," he said, "that his unfortunate country stood in so sore a need of advocates in Parliament." The Chamber could not resist his pathetic appeal, but decided almost unanimously that the deputy of Nice should be allowed to exercise his rights as an acknowledged deputy, in spite of the rules and customs of the Rouse, which were al opposed to such a course. This is tantamount to a demonstration in favour of Nice.

			AUSTRIA.
			(FROM OU1 OWN CORRSPONDEMNT.'
			VIENNA, AI?rIL 10.
			It i9 generally reportedthat the immediate cause of the desperate act committed by Count Stephen Szechenyi was a domiciliary visit which he received towards the end of last week, but the unfortunate gentleman was not molested by the police after the 3d of Mlarch, on which day his papers were taken from him by M. von Felsenthal, the chief of the Vienna detective force. Among the writings seized on the day in question -were an unfinished political pamphlet and some letters containing remarks which were flattering neither to the Austrian system of government nor to its upholders, but the autho- rities found nothing which could furnish them with a valid excuse for imprisonina the illustrious lMagyar. Many persons of high rank and standing were in the habit of calling on the Count, and the Minister of Police daily received a list of the names of the persons who visited himn. In its account of the life and death of Count S. Szechenyi, the Ost-De.scAe Post attributes to him .IZin Blc auf " Ein RBckbfick," a work made up of violent and very coarse abuse of Baron Bach, the late Minister of the Interior, and I therefore feel bound to state that the deceased some months ago directed a mutual friend to assure me that he was not the author of the book in question. * The body, after having received the benediction of a priest at Ober-Dbling, wiU be conveyed to the family vault at Gross-Zinkendorf, an estate belonging to the Szechenyi family. It is to be foreseen that there will be a national mourning for the Count, who was the first person to develope the resources of Hun- gary. He was the founder of the Danubian Steam Navigation Company; he began the regulation of the Danube and the Theiss; he first proposed to unite the sister cities of Buda and Pesth by means of a suspension bridge, and he, by the force of example, induced his fellow-nobles to make Hun- garian their "every-day" language. The Count, who was a great admirer of the political insti- tutions of Eugland, always strongly insisted on the necessity of a complete revision of the ancient Hungarian Constitation. but he felt no sympathy for Kiossuth. It is believed here that the death of Count Szechenyi will produce a tremendous sensation in Hungary; and men in oflice are ill at ease. Eight months ago Count Szechenyi, who was then declared to be of sane mind, disposed of his property by means of a last will and testa- ment.
			Shortly before the funeralof M. vonrForinyak took place the Director of Police at Pesth expressed his fears that tbe public peace would be disturbed by the people, but he was told by the magnates that they would take aU the re3ponsibility on themselves. if the police were withdrawn fron the streets. M. von Prottma,rn kept his agents out of sight, and the peace of the city was not for a single moment disturbed. M. Charles von Vida, the proprietor and editor of tho Clausenburg HIagyar Fudr, was publicly tried a fewv days ago for having attempted to excite the people to sedition by means of a leader entitled " ScyUa and Charybdis." The counsel for the CrowD proposed as a punishment for the ofience loss of nobilitv, hard labour for 12 months, Day- ment of the costs, forfeiture of 500 florins of the deposit or caution money, and finally loss of the right to publish either the Maaqyar Fll dr or any other political paper. 'A. von VTida spoke ably in his own defence, but a speech made by Dr. Senz, the editor of the German SihenbUiirger Bote, produced such an impression on the Court-a quorum is always com- posed of five judges-tbat it acquitted the defendant. The counsel for the Crown will, however, appeal against the sentence pronounced by the lower Court.
			Nogotiations relative to the neutralized districts of S-avoy are still going on between the Four Great Powers. As this Government did not do battle in defence of Tuscany and Modena, is it likely that it wiU render any material assistaneo to Switzerland, a Power for which it feels very little (if any) sympathy? The Duke of MIodena intends to keep up his little army in Venetia, but it is not known to what end. On the 30th of March the Archduke Leopold left the Tyrol after having inspected the fortifications on the frontiers towards Lombardy, but he went to Verona again, in- stead of returninct to this city. The inhabitants of the fintschgau are in despair at the very thought of the destruction of the magnificent road across the Stelvio, but the Vandalism wil probably be committed, as two or three officers of Engineers are of opinion that the " Franzen's-llohe," the summit of the mountain, is indefensible. The Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany, who was at Dresden for some weeks, left for TUplits on the 6th inst., but he passed Easter Sunday and Monday with his parents at Schlackenwerth in Bohemia.
			The Cracow Czas (Times) has said nothing either of the reported attempt to take the lifo of the Emperor Alexander or of the advance of Russian troops to the MIoldavian frontier, and this silence leads me to believo that there is no truth in either rumour. The Czeas is the best-informed paper in Europe on Russian matters, and in great request in Germany, where the intelligence it brings is worked up into "original correspondence from the Russian frontiers."
			Count Rechberg is so much better that he can receive visits.
			During the war in Italy the Roman Catholic Church in Austria, which is enormously rich, con- tributed nothing towards the extraordinary ex- penditure of the State, and now it has taken no part in the loan. It has, however, largely con- tributed to the fund for the Pope and his Govern- ment !
			There was literally no business done on 'Change to-day, although the Bourse was closed during the Easter holydays.

			FRA.NCE AND SWITZERLAND.
			Tne ITdjpen4lanwe Belge has the following:-
			'It becomes more and more probable that no Congress will be held on the Savoy neutrality question, and that the difference wiUl be terminated by a direct arrangement between the two States more particolarlylnterested.Varions combinations are reported. They tend to maintain intact the cession made by Sardinla to France, giving, however, a gtmranteo for the safety of Swiss neutrality. That guarantee would consist in the concession of a stra- tegical frontier, which, without granting to Switzerland aU she now claims, would, nevertheless, be of a nature to offer her certain satisfaction, apart from all idea of terri- torial aggrandizement. It Is proposed to give her up all tho shores of the Lalke of Geneva and the elopes of the mountains which separate the contested provinces from the Valais, and to cover the passage of the Tote-Noire and another lmportant defile in a strategical point of view."

			SWITZERLAND.
			A letter from Berne, dated April 9, Eays:-
			"The Federal Coucil held two sittings to-day, nohich never occurs except on very urgent business, and which is consequently a symptom of the gravltv of the situation. The greatest anxiety is felt asto how the Great Powers silL really ac, as it Is knovcn that England, Ac *Bnstia, and
			Prassia are agreed on recognizing the rlghts of Switzerland, 'while, on the other hand, it is also known that the idea of a conference, demanded in the circular note of the 5th of April, Is not equauy relished by all. Grea activity iB dieplayed In the militarydepartment.
			" Sir Robert Peel, who arrived at Genevayesterday, is the obiect of great attention from the leaders of both political camps, who, however, may now bh regarded as one, as the Conservatives display at least as much zeal as their former opponents in maintaining the rights of Switzer
			lsnd."

			RUSSIA.
			A letter from St. Petersburg of the 9th inst. says that the corps d'anere under the commandof General Bezac Is about to be concentrated at Odessa, where his head-quarters are at present. It is further stated that the four corps d'aiwie placed on the war footing during the war in Italy have not since been reduced to the peace establishment. Prince
			ortschaloff, Governor of Poland, has arrived at St. Petersburg. He went there to take the Em- peror's cosnmands vwith respect to the conscrip- tion about to be levied in Poland. An ukase is shortly expected to appear ordering a levy of troops to supply the vacancies caused in the army daring the last four years, -when there was no con- scription enforced. The nvriter oI the letter adds that there never existed a more friendly feeling than at present between the Russian and French Governments. Letters from Bulgaria received at St. Petersburg announce that the prayers in the churches in that province are no longer repeated in the Greek language, but in the native tongue. This change does not please the Russian Government, wbicli expects shortly to unite all its coreligionists uuder one head.

			SPAIN.
			The 'Madrid journals of the Sth inst. have ar- rived. Ortega had been or' red for trial before a court-martial sitting at Tortosa ; but Elio was to be tried by a civil court. Ortega's wife and children had arrived at Barcelona from the Balearic Islands. The 27,000 duros, in gold seized in his baggage after his flight, are, it ap- peara, the property of the Government, they having formed part of a sum sent to him to pay for fortifications executed at MIahon. In addi- tion to sparing the life of the Carlist chief 15io, the Queen had ordered that a young nobleman named Sobradiel, who had accompanied him and been arrested with him, should also not be executed, in the event of being condemned to death. From a despatch communicated to the newspapers it appears that it was AL M1on, Ambassador at Paris, who, under date of the 3d, made l;nown to the Government that Cabrera had left LiverDool to join Ortega, and that the Count de Montemolin himself had passed through Paris for Cette, to embark for Valencia to join him. " )Kontemolin," added the Ambassador, " did not wish to go, but Ortega told him that the occasion was favourable."

			INDIA.
			COMrIHERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
			(F:om the Calcutta EwIllshman.)
			[Tho following app,eed in our second edit'lon of yes- terday :-l
			CALCUTTA, SATURDAY, 9A-CI 10.
			On the 23d nlt. a telegram from Galle brought us Lon- don intelligence of the 25th of January, and on the foUow- ing day news of the 20th was received, tid Bombay. Letters and papers of the maU were received by the steamer Bentinek which arrived on the 7th inst. On the 28th ult. another telegram from Bombay put us in possession of Lon- don news of the 3d uIt.; letters and papers of this date were broueht by tho Bombay express on the 5th inst. On the 5th inst. a telegram from GaUe brought us London news of the 10th nlt., and on the next day a telegram from Bombay had nows of tho 18th.
			PRODUCE MARIKET.
			Business continues to bo done only in fulfilment of ton. nagoe engagemnents. Tho small supplies of produce enable holders to sustain prices, but there is no animation in the market. We are stiUl unable to mention a single article of export that is not above home rates.
			IMPORT rserF.T.
			The beginning of the last fortnight ghowed marks of a revival in piece goods, but suddenly the long prevailing tight- ness of the money-market became greater, and this checked business to a high degree. lsot only have the transactions been very limited, but prices generally have receded a little. In this state of the market three native holydays have ocourred, during and before which nearly every kind of business is stopped. We have therefore to report a dull and quiet market, with a hope that aiter these holydays are over we shall see a general revival in piece goods, as also in yarns, wvhich are very quiet, and lower.
			Metals steady in demand, and in prioes we quote sheath- ing copper at 44-S.
			JOINr-STOCK SARES.
			The temporary dearnes3 of money in the Bazaar has not had any prejudicial effeot on the value of joint-stock shares, which generally are in favour for investment; the immediate exceptions are Bongal Bank sbares, and Bengal Coal and Calcutta Steam Tug shares. The Hon. James Wilson's announcement of a Government paper currency for all India secured to the publc as are the notes of the Bank of England,and the withdrawal of the privilege now enjoyed by the Bank of Bengal to Iseue notes, has materially affected the shares, and rates have nominally faUen 1,400r. per share. We hear of shares being offered at 4,500r. Coal shares have been sold at 1,6G5r., and there aro few buyers of Steam Tugs over 5OOr. India Generals are still the favourite scrip, and have boen'p]aced at 1,SlOr. each, or 810r. premium upon the patr value of 1,000r. Dock shares have changed hands! at S5Or., anld bonded warehouse shares are wanted at 355r. The Calcutta Atuction Company have declared their fourth half-yearly dividend at the rate of 12 per cent. per annum.
			GOVERNMENT SECURITI.
			The pressure for money in the Bazaar and the difficulty of obtaining accommodation from the banks have caused considerable depression in the several descriptions of Go. vernment paper, and prices have been seriously affected. The Five-and.a.Half per Cents. have been sold at from 8 annas discount to par ; the Five per Cents. from 5 to 5-8 discount; and the Four per Cents. at 18 per cent. discount.
			MONEY-MARET.
			The large amount paid into the Treasury for transfer before the closing of the Five-and-a-iEalf per Cent. Loan, and the difficulty of obtaining advances from the Ban'. of Bengl and the other local banks, prodnced a tightness in the money-market, which was greatly aggra. vated by large snms paid in to Government on account of the salt saies; as high as 20 per cent. was paid in the Bazaar npon good security; rates are somewhat easier, bnt stillvery high. The following isthe report of the Bank of Bengal for the week onding 7th of March, 1860 .
			EXCHANGE.
			Rates of exchange on London have remained, with some .=light fluctuation, at prevlous rates, say 2.1k to 2-1g for Bank hills, and 2-1.' to 2-1 for credits. Documents at 2-1g. The supply has been limited, but the difficulty of obtaining moneY in payment for imports has kept buyer3 out of the market, or the rate would nave been probably lo ver.
			FI=GlHTS.
			WVehave no change to notice in freights to Europe since the departure of last maiL Rates to Mauritius have advanced considerably snd to A merica also slightly. Rtates to France keep up very high, and no ships to be got, Next shins for Coelies to Maritius will be at n for higher rates, and for the West Indies and Tamaic3 ships are wanted yet for emigrants, but with very lttle chance of success, in the
			resencetof large requirementsof ships for the China ser- vice, v;hich denand contnumes. The i scaty supply of ton- e nasge and smnall number of expected ships wiUl not he able to supply present vwants; frelghts therefore may go up sitill betfore thc next mail leaves this port.

			MIITAlRY AND NAVAL IZNTBLLG1.JC.-
			His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, with General Sir Richard Airy, Geneal Mansell, General Craw- ford, Col Blngham, CoL Charteris, and Major Barnard, 2rrived at Dover on Thursday, after inspecting the troops at Walmer, &amp;c. Hli Royal Highness and suite dined and slept at the Royal Ship Hotel, nd yesterday morning com- 3nenced an inspection at the CastlelWestern Heights, &amp;c. The weather was not favomuable. His Royal Highness would remain at Dover also last night, and was to entertain n select party at dinner.
			Their Royal Hlghneeses the Dukes d'Aumale and de Liont- pensier, accompanied by the Count Villamanrique, and a auperior oficer of the Spanish army, went down to Wool.
			wich on Thursday, for the special purpose of inspecting Sir Wllliam Armstrong's rifled ordnance factory. The ilus- trious strangers entered the RoyalArsenal at 10 o'clock, in a carriage and four, and were received by Colonel Tulloh, Royal carriage department; Mr. Anderson, Royal gan factories; Capt. Boxer, Royal laboratory; Capt. Gordon, principal military storekeeper; and the officials of the esta- blishment generaly. A special order of admission had been t?ansmitted lo the heads of departments for their Informa- tion, inthe name of Count Villamanrique and three friends. Having inspected the entire establishment of the Arsenal, which occupied five hours, Including a prolonged visit to the gun factory, they accompanied Colonel Tnuloh to his official quarters and partook of luncheon, and left the Arsenal at 4 o'clock on their return to London.
			Vlce-Admiral the H(on. Sir Richard Dundas, one of the LordsCommisalonersof ths Admiralty, and Rear-Admiral Sir Baldvwin Walker, Controller of the Navy, yesterday vbited WoolwfchDockyard,andmadeaninspection of the armament and fittings of the new screw steam schooner Ranger, in Zeadiness for the pennant. The Ranger is the first of that cla3s of ships, and is fitted on a peculiar method adapted for warm climates, so as to insure the greatest amount of air ancdventilatlonu After their Lordahips' inspection of the Ranger, having been joined by Capt. the Hon. A. Coch- xane, they proceeded to the factory, and examined the new improved ships' boilar manufactured from the designs of the Earl of Dundonald. They afterwards went on board the steara corvette Bristol, in a forward state of constrac. tion, visited the rigging loft, rope walk, and various parts of the yard, and finally repaired to the testing-house, and witnessed a trial of the superiority of Mr. Lennox's new metal blocks for ships' rigging, which were tested againstthe old Admiralty wooden blocks hitherto In use. A 4A.-inch rope wsas used in the trial, and the strain having arrived at 25- tons, the Admiralty block gave way, while the metal one on being examined appeared to have suffered no injury. Their Lordships thereupon terminated their visit and re- turned to London.
			Surg. -Major T. P. Matthew, attached to the Staff at the headquarter3 of the Mfedical Department, Chatham, has rceived orders to proceed to Yarmouth to do duty at the invalid establishment formed at that station.
			Capt. F. W. J. Dugmore, 8th Foot, has joined the 1st battalion of the depOt of that regiment at Chatham.
			An order has been Issued from the Horse Guards to all corps at home and abroad, directing them to state in their monthly returns forwarded to the Adjutant-General any requiitions for arms, accoutrements, ammunition, clothing, and necessaries, which had not been complied with.
			The troops who arrived at Chatham on Thursday after.
			noon from India, having disembarked at Gravesend 1 from the hired East India troop ship South, Commander Robertson, were paraded yesterday morning for inspection at St. Mary's barracks by Lieut.-Col. J. F. De Telsaier The numberof men who disembarled at Gravesend was up wards of 300 of all ranks, belonging to the 7th (Princess Royal's) Dragoon Guards, 7th Royal FusUliers, 24th, 46th, 51st,and 52d(Light Infantry),G4th, TOth,7Sth(Hghilanders), 81st, 87th (Royal Irish Fasiera, and 95th Regiments. The foUowing officers arrived In charge of the troops:- Capt. Drummond, 5th European Light Cavalry; Capt. Johnstone, Her Majesty's 24th Regiment; Lients. Shepherd and Sitwell, 5th Earopean Light Cavalry ; Lieut. Boswell, 69th Bengal Native Infantry ; Cornet Redman, 7thDragoon Guards; and Dr. Macdonald. A party of nearly 200 non- commissioned officers, formerly in the service of the East India Company, arrived in the same ship to be discharged. Most of Her Majesty's troops are men whose term of service has expired, and there are scareely any invaUlds among them. The South sailed from Xurrachee on the 23d of December last, and was 110 days on the passage to the Thames.
			The hired transports Ellen, Secret, and Sarah, laden with vrar stores for Gibraltar and 3falta, yesterday sailed from Woolwich for their destination.
			A lengthy Admiralty circular was read yesterday on board the different ships at Spithead, and in Portsmouth harbour, the main points of which are as follows:-
			"On ordinary occasions no officer or man Is to be granted leave beyond 48 hours. The officers and crews of ships re- fitting may be granted a period of four days' leave at the discretion of the Commander In Chief.
			"On a ship arriving in England from a foreign sta- tion, officers were, and stewards may be, permitted to land to purchase any necessary refreshments during the day, but are not to sleep oat o! the ship.
			On the ship's arrival in England the offices and crew arfeto he kept on board until the work of dismantling is completed. All documents with regard to pay are to be transmitted immediately, and no portion of the crew are to bo alioved any leave under these circumstances, except under thesanction of the Commanderin Chief, and then not exceeding a pe tied of 24 hours.
			"On a sh7phbeing paldoff the leave sanctioned by their ordshipa is to hbegranted, and wvhen an extension is re- quired it must be obtained by the authority of the Com- mander in Chief.
			"Their Lordships expect, by the foregoing regula- tions and indulgences, that no man wiU he absent without authority when in receipt of his pay.
			All men absent without leave from a ship to which he belongs shall be immediately checked on the shipb8 books and pay stopped without he can give a satisfactory explana- tion which can be approved by the senior officer present.
			"All seamen going en leave are to be furnished with liberty passes, showing the date and hour of the day on wh ch their leave expires.
			"All seamen absent from their ships on tho da3y of sailing, fromrwhatever cause,areto e . q. intheships hooks, their pay and alotments immediately stepped, and a list of those men sent to the Accountant-General.
			"In all cases in which men are absent from their ships when s.ailing from a port they may be apprehended, or they may voluntarily Join a flag or any ether ship at any port. Their names, together with al charges against them as stragglers and deserters, are to be entered on the booka of such ship, and they are to be borne ouly for victuals, and to wait a passage to their own ship. The ratings of petty officers, in such cases, will be suspended, and they are never to be entered on board such flag or other ship with any higher rating than that of A.B., and they are not to be discharged as part complement to an- other than their proper ships without express authority from the Admiralty. On reaching their proper sFlps they will to received as part complement in
			ny ra3tin g that may be cpen at the discretion of the captain, but the '. q.' wilU never be removed, nor will arrears of pay be allowved, excepting In consequenca of strong explana- tions from the captain to their Ioriships."
			The crews oE the sLips at Spithead and in the harbour were last night granted 4S hours' leave, in accordance with the Admiralty circular, the chief points of which we have given above. It Is impossible to say whether tho Edgar's crew have received any leave with the rest of the ships crews, for so much mystery is observed with respect to this ship that no extent of reliable information can be obtained. It Is, however, certain that, from whatever cause arose the late disturbance on board, it was much more serious than has yet been made public. Rear-Admiral the Hon. F. T. rulham has visited the fleet at Spithead, and is in possession of the whole facts in connexion with the matter. Tlio gallant Rear-Admiral returned to tovn from Ports- mouth last evening. It is stated that the Marires on board the Ed,ar are to be replaced by a draught from head- nuartets.
			The Algiers, 91, screw, iCapt. George D. O'Callaghan, bas sent down her topgallant mxsts, topsail, and lower yards, and the crew on board are emuployed in over- hauling her rigging, &amp;5c. One of those cases which are now often witnessed In our naval ports, occurred at Portsmouth yesterday, when one of the Algiers' crew, a "bounty- man, was dischared from the ship for " incompetency" amid the derision of the crew. The Algiers is a well. manned ship.
			Major-General Bloomfield, Inspector-General of Artillery, and his aide-de-camp, Major Teesalile, C.B., are expected to visit the Channel Islands, next week.
			The lIowe, 121, was toweed on Thursday from the sheer hulk in Hamuoaze into the basin at Reyham Steam-yard, preparatory to her being docked snd coppered, &amp;c.
			The crew o' the screw steamship Nile, 90, Capt. Edward N.Barnard,in Plymouth Sound, were paid wages in advance on Thursday. Lady Milne, wife of Rear-Admiral Sir Alex. ander Milne, K.C.B., Commander-in-Chief on the North Armeric3 and West India station, was conveyed on board In the afternoon by the steam tug Zephyr. Lady Iilne takes passage in the NIleto the station.
			The Iron paddlewbeel steam surveying vessel Bann Master James S. WcUs, was taken into No. 4 dock In the Devonport Dockyard on Thursday to bs repaired and have her bottom cleaned and coated with composition.
			The triningship Implacable, 72, was put in commission at Plymouth on Thursday by the Commander.

She spoke, March 4, the English bark Queen of the Sea; 12th. the BaUarat; April 9th, the American ship Robert Pesl, and the bark Escape; and. on the lCtb, the Gem of the Ocean.

			K-w GARDESS.-The following information with
			regard to sonme new arrancgements at the Royal Pleasure Grounds and Botanic Gardens at Kew may be useful to the public at the present season. The pleasure grounds will be open to the pablic daily from the 1st of May to the 31st of October, from 1 o'clock p.m. (2 o'clock on Sundays) till sunset; the entrances are in the Kew and Rlchmond-road, by the Lion-gate andt by the Unicorn-gate, and on the river side by tho gIte adjoining the Bhentford ferry. There are communlcations opened between the botantc gardens and the pleasure grounds by gates in the bonndary fence. These grounds do not appear to be at present sufficiently known by the pblic. They occupy an extensive area between Keew and Richmond, bounded on the north by the botanic gar. dens, on tho south by the old deer-park of Richmond, on the east by the Richmond-read, on the west by the Thames. They weore in former ttmes the Royal private ehooting grounds; but they have lately, by the gracious permission of Hier Ma^jesty, been thrown open to the public duringw the summer months.

			IHSOLVfBNT DBBTOZS' COURT, April 13.
			__ - LN T}lE MAB T OF HEFHRY LAMNG.
			(Before the CUnixr Co'mmsio.-i-
			-.ims insolVent, a publlcan, 'who had lately kept the George IV. at Croydon, was opposed by Mr. Dowse, on the tart of James Banfeldd, a pedestrian, and spported by Mr.
			The comsplaint was that the Insolvent d cheated Ban- field out of 201., and had him to 42. law expenses, in gettig n ban-en verdict.l V November, Banfield walked on the insolvent's ground at Croydon 1,000 miles in 1,000
			half heurs. The extraordlinary feat day andl night, was accomplished in 21. days. On the k0th of Nohvember, a dinner was given in celebration, and Banfield was presentedi by the insolvent with a check on his bankers for 251. Of that sum 201. was considered to have been taken at the gate, and the insolvent presented 5?. on account of the custom
			brought to his house. Subsequently an action was brought against the insolvent, to whom the check had been returned, to recover that amount, on which the jury awarded 15b. as damages, and the costs were 421. 4s. Sd. The insolvent had
			been taken in execution, having about the time of the trial
			disposed of his publicnhsonusae whic h ad held for six years. The change preduced upwards of 1,700?., end all he received was 101. The point in the case was whether the defence to the action was a vexatlous proceeding, end the evidence now given was of a contradictory character. Ban- field alleged that he was to have the money collected. It mountd to 191. lSs. l0d, end was considered as 201. The insolvent gave a cheek for 251. and it was handed a day or two afterwards to the insolvent to take care of, as there were some bad characters In the house and this money might not be safe. Subsequently Banfield applied for the money and on the 12th of December a bill of charges was delvered amounting tol91.lSs.lOd.,andsubsequentlyoneto20l.lSslOd. An action was brought and resulted as stated. On the other hand, the insolvent alleged that Banfield was to pj the expenses and the bil' came to2. lSs. l0d. He deniea that he applied to Ban;fled to walk, hut Banfield declared that he bad appl'ied to him. He had walked before at the in- solvent's ground, in May, end received the collections, pay ing his expenses. The insolvent said ho had no bancer's account. e found a blank cheek which he filled up. He declated that the ceremony was gone through In order that Banfield's friends might further subscribe and that the check was to be returned. Banfield declared that he was to have the money and to place it in the bank for hiswel- fare.
			The CHIEF Coassmomeu was of oplnion that Banfield had spoken truth and that he had been unfairly dealt with by the imsolvent. It was not to he snpposed that a man was to labour in such a manuer for three weeks for nothing. Therefore, he believed Banfield's statement. The COURT gave a judgment of eight calendar months for a vexatious
			defence.

			BIUTT V. THE JUSTICES OF TIrE 1ANOVER-SQUARE
			DI V'ISION.
			This was an appeal against the refusal of the justices of the division mentioned to renew the licence to the King's Arms, in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square.
			Mr. Poland appeared on behalf of the respondents; Mr. Sleigh for the appellant.
			MIr. POL.AD said the justices below had felt it to bc their duty to refuse the renewal of this licence, as the appel- lant had permitted persons to assemble in his house avow- edly for the purposes of betting on horse-racing, after hav- ing been warned by the Chairman of the Petty Sessions on more than one occasion, and for which he had been con- victed by a police magistrate, and fined 501., under the Betting-house Act. From a knowledge of what was going on the police, under the authority of Sir Rlchard Mayne, entered the appellant's house on the 4th of April, 1859, and proceeded upstairs to a back room on the first floor, in the door of which was a pane of glass, on which was written, "Subscription-room, and there they found a number of persons-about 30-engaged in betting, and books relating to betting transactions were found upon most of the per- sons present, who consisted of professed bettiog men, gentlemen's servants and some few tradesmen. For this offence the appellant was convicted under the Betting-house Act, by Mr. Beadon, the magistrate, in the penalty of 501.. and two others, named Russell and Harrington, or Barring- ten, were also convicted, ho believed, en the same occasion. MIr. Sleigh appeared for the appellant, but no appeal w-as made against the magistrate's deelsion. The bench had warned all the pubUicans in the division that their licenoes would be ref used If these practices were carried on, and that they would not be allowed to transfer their licencs if they disregarded that caution, and this being considered by the bench below a very bad case, as setting at defiane, as it were, the openly-expressed determination of the magis- trates, they decided-and the decision was come to by a very fell bencb, and who were unanimous-tht it Was their duty to abselutely refuse this licence to the appellant. It was for this Court nowto determine whether the judgment they had given was a proper ons, and he (Mr. Poland) ventured to submit that upon a consideration of the circumstances the Court would confirm their decision. Ie would call the witnesses.
			Mr. SLroGu said the fact of the conviction was uncon- troverted, he admitted it.
			The AsesATxNT-JUDnu said it would be better for aU the circumstances to bh detailed to the Court.
			Superintendent Hannent was then called, Ile said be reduced an order of Sir Richard Mayne to enter Mr. Batt's house, and en the 4th of April he executed it. It was in the evening, probably aboult 9 'clock, He went upstairs to a room on thc first floor, on the door of whieh, on a pane of glass, was written " Subscrlptien-reem." When he entered the room he found the appwellant and 30 other per- sOPS. HTe asked him if he was3 Mr Butt he said he was, and witness told him he had Sir Richard iayne's warrant to enter the house as a bettng-house, and that he and al who were present mus't oonslder themselves in custody. Ho searched, and founcd a numbir of books on betting transac- tions, which he gave to the inspoctor who was with him (Webb), and took possession of about 61.0?. in money. There were 10 or 11 known betting men there, 10 or 11 servants, grooms chiefly (in livery), the rest were tradesrmen. Some of the books were given up, as they centained only ordinary memoranda, the betting books were deained, and were now in court (a nile of them was paroduced).
			By Mr. SLEIGJI.-Since the coniiciton the house had been well conducted, and not the least complaint had now to be made of It or of the appellant
			Inspector Webb was next called, and he sald he accom. panied his superintendent on the occasion and took from the landlord 6001., and the sums found on the others varied down to a few shillings or coppers. He found there In the room sporting books, Rufs Guide, handica lists card, &amp;sc., bearing the names of horses against which marks were placed; some of them were taken from the perons, others were found under Eeats, where they had been thrown when the pollee entered. He was present at the llcensing meeting hleld preious to this visit, and heard tho chairman caution the vietuallers, the appellant, of coarse, among them, that where betting Was allowed the magistrates would nether renew nor transfer a Eicence. It was well known that betting0 was csrried on in this subscription-room, as It was terme, and that persona Tesorted there for tbht purpose only. He produced the beolos taken in the room.
			PoEce-constable 298 A said he went to the house on March 28, 1859, In plain clothes, by order, and went upstairs to the subscriptIon-room. There were about 30 persons present, Bettsng was going on, and he heard 100 crowns laid to one about The Earl wrinning the Northamnptonshire Stakes. The talk, was all about betting, and the company were masking bets all among each other. Fe was In the roomwhen the SuPerintendent and Webb entered on the 4th of April.
			Mr. SsEIGH then proceeded to addrezs the bench on behalf of the appellant, and submitted that the Picence might be granted on every rinciple of justice. The licensig magis- trates havng rf used to renew the lience to the appeld lant, he hadc sought their sanction for transferring it on three occasions, but they had refused, as he (Mtr. Sleigh) believed, with some regret, as they fealt themselves hounid by the pledge given formally by t: rir chairman, that they would not transfer a lcence refuised to be renewed under such cIrcumstances. wIth re- spect to what the appellant had been convicted of, which the magistrate had deemed a violation of the law, if it were so, the law had been vindicated, the appellant ha paid his penalty of 501. ; he submitt-ed to it, and said he would come to this Court and askc them either to grant him the licence to continue to carry on this house himself, or to be allowed to transfer it to some one else. There was a highy respect- able person, Air. Pick, ready to tak-e it, if the Court would not sanction Mr. Butt continuiog to conduct the house, and what objection wvould there be to that, either in law or jus- tice ? Mr. Butt had been descrbed as a betting man, buat why should that be imPorted Into the case to prejudice them in that wyhich he was seeking ? Did not the highest and
			noblest in the land bet; and if sach speulations were ilegal where was the limit? Look at the Stock Exchange, the Corn-Erchange, the cotton-market, and aee the tran- actions carried on there. Not only there, but in almost every branch of commerce. The same term vrould apply to the Prxemier of this countary, or any other person, however high or noble, who went upon the tort? and why should it be applied to this sppellant, to prejudice him in this important quesion of his licence, when the same thtng was done openly and avowedly by hundreds and thousands of others? Thls man hadconducted hls house honourably and respectably for 10 years, yet he was brought within the Betting Act, which was passed to put down thosa betting ehops which unquestionablv were a moral pes.lence, where the young and inexperie;ood were lured to speculate not always with money of their own, because, forsooth, he was himself a man whointerested himself in making bets, and where was there a man scarcely who did not? By a forced construetfon of that Act the appellant had been bronght within its operation. He hsd suffered for it. The law, if he had broken it, had been justied'and vindicated, 2nd he now appesled to the sense of justice of this Court, in which thcelement of mercy as wel ought not to bo en- tirely overlooked, to give him back the licence which the justices below had deprived him of, so that he might con- tinue to conduct his houso as heretofore himself, of course without the betting. or of transferring It to some one eLse if the Court so wished it. The bench would bear in mind that this betting did not take place in publc, indiscriml- nately over the counter, but in a private room uptairs' on the door of which " Subscription-room" was written fo;g before Mr. Butt had the house, and that there was not now the least police complaint against either the house or the appellant.
			The AsssArNM JuDor then put the qnesllon, and the appeal was rejeoted almost uanaimously, the appellant to pay coste.
			21r. XSsIEnD caUed attention to the short time that had elapsed between the Issuin of the llst of cascs and the day ef bearing, and said that Wth respect to appeals on new licencesthe magistrates had not had ti,ne to visit tho houses to~judge for themselves as bo the requirements of the nelgh- bourhoods.
			After some discussion, it was resolved to postpone the appeals in the new cases for a fortnight, and to proceed with thoserelating to renewals.
			Mr. POLAND said he had to apply to the Courb in respect of the case of Nathaniel L3nghanin, who appealed against the refasal of the justices of the division of the Strand to renew a licence to him for the Cambrian Stores, Lelces- ter-square. Ee was instructed to say that 3r. Edwin James, who was in the case, was not fully prepared to proceed with it then, and there were ether reasons why it should he postponed, as it was necessary for further infornation to ho obt3ined.
			Mr. Serleant BAzTAcrE, specially retained with Mr. letoalfe, said there was another case In the list-that of Benjarmin Cant, and if the case of Langham were to stand over he should. wih that Caunt'6 ngt also. Langham's
			as Sirst in order, and he should ask the Court to take the cases as they stood-Langhain's first-for reasons which he need not then state, but it would be very desirable that Caunt's should not bo taken by itself, but follow that of l.angham.
			Mr. AsNc-OBUS, chairman of the Strand divlsion, said he coald not see any reason for not taking Caunt's apart from Langham's ; they were quite distinct cases.
			Mr. Serjeant BALL.1LVHN-E said, one had an indirect hear- ing upon the other and he should prefer that they should be taken in order, Langham's before Caunt's.
			A discussion ensued, in which it was saggested that these two cases should go over to the day for appeals on the now licences, which proposition was much objected to, and even- tuay it was decided that they should stand adjourned to this day week, and ho then heard by themselves.
			William Miller appealed against the refusal of the justices of the Hanover-conare division to renew a licence to the George, South-street, Berkeley-square.
			hfr. ffwrcAnvE said this licence was refused, the landlord having been convicted of two offences, co itted on sepa- rate occasions. The appellant was a very respectble man and the gambling of which he had been convicted had not been a syten. N had it beeQ continued. The poice re- portedveryfavourably,and, under all the circumstances, the iustices (for whom he appeared) thought they conld, consis- tently with their public duty, withdraw their opposition to the appeal and no doubt the appelant would profit by the warntng which thesase, the Court had decided wouldr afford to all intereated In each matters.
			The licence was granted.
			James Coasine appealed against the refusal of the Strand justices to renew alicense to tha Three Tans, in dosghtona- street, Clare-market.
			hlr. oeteclf appeared for the app seant, and Mr. meeno for the respondents.
			In thls case there had been a complaint or a convcltion about liquors being served after 11 o'cloek oDe Stunday night, X sergeant anda constabl of theo F division gave a history oE somethint concerning a stolen quntt pot, and ah woman being carried away dead drunk on a streteher at half-past 11 o'clock at night. The sergeant, as usual with the police, called the time " p.m.," and also talked about " cvivlians " as contra-dIsting,uished from the police, but his Statement was scarcely understood, though it oera- s(oned sosneentertainment. It having been Intimated that the justices did not wish to press the opposition, the Aseistant. Judge took the opinion of the Conrt, and the licence was restored to the appellant.
			These were the only cases in the list as to renewals (ex- cept Cannt's and Langham's), and the Court adjourned.
			The Agenda Paper for the county day has beenlIssued, and. it containsaesupplomeutal notice that the electionoEIn'spec. tore of gas meters, under the Sales of Gas Act, will not tak;e place on the day appointed, " in consequence of a cosnuuni- cation from the Board of Trade."

			POrICB.
			MAN.rserox-xous -Margaret Quill, 11, was charged vwith begging, and Catherinc Quill, her mother, wlth negleoting to provide for her.
			The circumstances of the case were of a somewhat peculiar character. Catherine Quill Is an Irlshwoman, who, according to ber own account, ha resided in London for 16 -years, and about three years ago was deserted by her husbsnd ; and who ever since, according to the accounts of others, has subsisted upon the earnings of her four childen (the girl now charged being the oldest), whom she systematically sent into the strests to beg. Time after time they were sent homne by the police, or conveyed to the union, but the mother as regularly sent them out again, after demanding them autho- rItatively If In the onion, until It was judged advisable, for the protectioni of the children themselves, to take them into custody and deal with them as vagrants. In this way they have all appeared at various times at the bar of this court, eometimes together and sometimes separately, the two younger onesbeing agpin eent tothe onion as the result, while thetwo elder were seatenced to termnsofi irisonmuentrangin from 21 days to twvo months ; and so the g~rlnorwMc1h1a1rged had been already convicted no fewer than 14 times. Her 14th con- viction took place about three wee-s ago, and on that occasion the mother wa su1mmoned, and voluntarily bound herself, under the Industrial Schools Act, 187, to provide for her daughter, Margaret Quill, for 12 months from that time, rendering herself liable to a penalty of 40g., with one month's imprisonment in default, In the event of the girl being again found committing an act of vagrancy In the city withiu the year. ln lees than a week, however, Mr- garet Quil was again apprehended for begging, In conse- aueneo of which a warrant was issued for the apprehension ol tho mother. With a good deal of trouble the pollee traced her to a low lodging-house, where, with her three younger children, sbe occupied a room, tho sole farniture of which wais an old bed onx the dloor and a single chair, and, while the childrena were oneo more conveyed to the union, she was brought to this court and charged wlth neglecting to provide for her chUd Margaret, according to the terms of her voluntary declaration.
			There had been an intention of sending the girl to a refor. matory for five years, hut, as the power of the Court to do so appeared to he doubtful on a strict construction of the motherowas finedal41,amnd, idn defanult otf p ent, ord ered to be imprisoned for one month. ym , e

			MAntnLBOuOuGsTRESrr.--Thomas Johnson, 38, of gentle- manly appearance, was charged before Mr. BEEADoN by Mr. Thomas Lolcester, an independent gentleman, residing st 1 Pelham-place, Brompton, with defrauding hlm, at various times since the early part of November, of considerable sums of money.
			Mr. Edward lEwis, of Marlborough-street, conducted the case against the accused, and, after giving an outline of a very extraordinary series of events, called In support of the same the prosecutor.
			Mr. Leicester then went Into a lengthy etatement,the sub- s,tance of which is as fellows *-e arrived in London from Southport on the 1st of November last, and on the follow- ing day met a man named Richard Hefford whom he had seen in the country before starting. lthey had a game or two at cards, but no money was lost. He readily, moreover, lent Hefford a sum of money, and a proposition was made that they should proceed to Woolwich, and they went. On board the boat the prisoner came up, and, getting into conversation with them, said he was going to vidt the arsenal. This was just one of the places they were going to themselves, and they an agreed to go together. Itwas found at Woolwicha they were too late, and thle ensuing morning was appointed. Cards were then proposed by Hefford, and they played at an hotel they ad. journed to at vinyl-cl-un, over which ho lost 201. or 30Z. Over the game the prisoner entertained them with somc. what of his history, in w;hich he informed them he had come from Wales on a lawsuit. A second time they all met, aud apain went to Woolwich, where cards, on the proposition of Hefford, ware again played, up to whlch Heflord 'who all along knew ho had money, had had 100 of hi. At that time he had 400l. about him; the night before he had 1,0001., but had been oleared out of (lost) 6001. At another house near the barracks he lost at cards, and had no doubt by foul play, be- tween 201. and 301. with the prisoner. The prisoner said his name was Johns, and as Johns he always after addressed him. At Scott's, in the Haymarket, the prisoner got of him 2.01 by "tossing." Within the last threo weeks he had lost at billiards with the prsoner In Regent-street 100L. It was at "one sitting" Hefford acting as the marker. Hefford had proposed blliards, and the prisoner seconded him, and tEus ho was led Into it, During th interval he had played with the prlsoner at biliards in Queen-street and lost. He had now found out that the pri- soner always let him come very nearly to the "wi nnng mark," but then suddenly " turned the tables," and he lost. He (prosecutor) had said on one occasion, before the pri- Eoner, he was going to Portsmouth, and directly after he got there whom should he meet hut the Prisoner, and cards were played again, with the usual result. He charged the prisoner with frae d in these transactions. He hada hundeds of him since he first met htm in November.
			MTr. Edwin Malcolm, 35, Grove-place, Brompton, manager to the Saloon Omnibus Company, deposed to seeing the pri- sonar and Hefford frequently together.
			Gordon, a detective officear, knew the prisoner as a con- stant companion of gambles ad sharpers, and sald he be- lieved he got his living among them~.
			Mr. BKADos.-Where do you reside, defendant?
			Defendant.-At 2, Cowley-place, Brook-street, Kenning- ton-road. I am In no business.
			Mr. Lewis, in asking for a remand, remarked that the pre-i sent was another illustration ofthe old adage, "POOls and their money aIre soon parted," hut the prosecutor (r. Lei. cester) had evidently been doped out of a large sum of money, From the day be met 'with thoe risoner, who had so

			i.B R}ELTEOUS DISSENSIONS AT ST.:
			GEORGEJIN-THB-BAST.
			Y,berday Mr. William John Thompson, the senLr tbnrchwarlen of the parish of St. George-in-the-East, appeared before lUr. Yardley to answer a summons which charged him with assaulting Mr. Charles Warren Adams, a 7oung gentleman who is a personal friend of the rector, and liastaken &amp;prominent part in the unhappy disputes arising eut of tho innovations introduced into the services of the church.
			Mr. Pddeaux (in the absence of Mr. Serjeant BaLantine, the senior counsel for the prosecution, who did not arrive mitil 4 o'clock) opened the case for the&amp;prosecution, and said the complainant was a young gentleman of good family, the son of the late Mr. Sezjeant Adams, and his (Mr. xrldeaux's) personal friend. The learned counsel went over some of the events connected with the unhappydlsputes In the parish of St. George and the fearfnl disturbance of S9anday evening last, with which the public are so familiar, and said there was a pre-determination to prevent the proper and decent performance of Divine service in the ehurch. Ile aocused Mr. Thompson of exceeding his autho- rity as churohwarden, and urged that the sole desire of the Xcev. Bryan KMing, the rector, was that the services of the church should beconducted in a solemn and religious manner, and withoutinterruption. Mr. Prideaux then stated the cir- cumstances of the assault as given in evidence, and accused Mr. Thompson of being actuated by private malice and SeIto against Mir. Adams, who had written ttwo letters to the olsurchwasden, demanding his authority for informing the Chancellor of the BishoP that he (Mr. Adams) had broken down the reading desk raiL. To those letters no answer had been returned, although the first was forwarded to Mr. Thompson on the lat, and the second on the 3th of MEarch. The defendant -had only acted ceoloura- lbly as churchwarden to gratify prsvate malice; and, if he even had a right to remove Mr. Adams from the altar where he was standig, he had no business to do lt Eo roughly as he had done, and was guilty of an excess.
			The evidence of the complainant, who was corroborated by Mr. Baker, an anny surgeon attached to the 3d or FaLsi leer Gnards, MIr. Morrison, a solicitor's clerk, and Mr. Lamert, went to show that in the course of the disturbancees in the pariah church on Sunday evening last TMr. Adams heard that the people were at the altar which since the removal of the choristers' seats, had been set apart for the choris. ters, and that some persons had got within the rais. Mr. Adams made his way to the gates of the altar to prevent any more persona enterig, with his arms crossed; while in this position several parsons attemped to enter the altar, sad among them was a labourlag man, a dirty man. He k ept thorn back. Mr. Themnponcaine upin a violent passion and said, " What business bave you hero? Where do you come from ? I wiLl base you out of this," seired him by the c ollar, and with the assistance of haUf-a-dozen other persona pushed him forward. AMr. Thompson aiso kicked him with I3B knee, and he was sent " flying," and "flew" into the arms of the beadle who led him towards the western end of the church, treated him very courteously, and released him.
			The witnesses all agreed that Mr. Thompson was very much exctted.
			It was asserted by Mr. Lamert, one of Mr. Bryan King's choriaters, that his surplice was torn in the struggle and con- fusion, and he fainted. A chorister boy received a blow on the head and was nearly killed, and was now labouring under concussion of the brain.
			In cross-examination by Mr. Howell, the witnesses ad- mitted they had been in the practice of passing through the pa-sonage, and being admitted into the church by a private entrance every Sunday, to take Dossession of preferential seats. They also admitted that the altar was decorated in an unusual manner for Easter day on Sunday last.
			Mr. Prideaux called upon the defendant to put In two letters addressed to him by Mr. Adams In March iast.
			Mr. Howell did not see what they could have to do with the case.
			Mr. YAscnDiEY.-I don't 'knowv. The abject is to showv zome Il1-feeling en the part of the defendant, I suppose.
			The two letters werw handed to the Magistrate by Mr. Thompson.
			(The letters were of the nature described by counsel. ?No answer had been returrned to them.1j
			The Rev. Bryan King, recotor of St. George's,wae examined at great length.-He oaid in consequence of the many df.a. turbanCes and the indecent conduct of the people I gave directions for the gates of the church not to be opened until 'the police camae. The police were late, and I directed the sextonL to open the gates at 22 minutes before 7 o'clock on Sunday evening the usual hour of opening the gates formerly was half-past 6 o'clock. I sent for the de- fendant soon afterwards to the little vestry, and said to him, "M3r. Thompson, there are people In front of the altar wbile the seats are empty. It is your duty to seat people." Mr. Thompson said, " I don't want to be told ny dutty by you. Ihave been kept waiting at the gate 10 3nsmutes." Some Sundays sinceI said to Mr. Thompson, " Yout may peass through the parsonaso and into the little vestry to gain admission to the church.'
			In cross-examination by Mr. Howell, the witness said that It was the duty of the sexton to assist the people to take their pews. I do no; mean to say it la the duty of the church- warden to be pew-opener. Since the police have attended the church, T have ordered the gates to be oDened on their arrival. My own personal friends come from&amp; a distance to preserve order and restrain violence in the church.
			In cross-examination the rev. gentleman said the altar was decorated in precisely the same manner last Sanday as It was on every Easter day, except that there were five bou- quets last Sunday, instead of four.
			The cross-examination was continued for a long time, and embraced al the lealing topices connected with the dis- turbances in St. George's Church during the past year.
			The rector concluded by stating that if the church- wardens had acted with firmness and determination the first day and suppressed the disturbances, they would not have been repeated. Ile was not In the church en the first day the disturbances took place.
			Mfr. George Allison, Inspector of the K division, ea2d he was in St. George's Church onSundaylast. e aMr. Thompson tphke thon him,and was notsinthe leastexcited at that time. A plce ws kpt fee etwen te pupitand the altar for thechoistrs.He awthecomlaianttryngto keep the
			Jn cross-exanination by Mr. Howell, the witness said the people crowded towards the altar to see the floral decora- tions and crosses, at which they appeared much displeased and Irritated. He believed Mr. Thompson did aU In his power to preserv-e order and prevent disturbances.
			By Mfr. YARDLteY.-Several persons had got Into the altar before Mr. Thompson approached it, and he imme- diately removed Mr. Adams and cleared them aU out of the apse or quasi-altar. Mr. Thompson made a general clear- amce of the altar. It was aU done by the chnrchwarden in- stonily. I saw no violence of manner and no excitement cu the part of MIr. Thompson.
			Mr. YAJP.DLEY gave a strong opinion that on the evidence cf the last witne.ss called by learned counsel the case against hEr. Thompson entirely failed. The defendant appeared to have done what the recter wished him to do-requested the people to take their seats and cleared the altar. Mr. Thompson did not remove Mr. Adams solely, but he re- moved everybody in the altar and cleared a space for the choristers.
			Mr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr.Prldeaux severally argued strongly against tho view taken by the magistrate, and contended that an assault had been committed and the churchwarden ought to be convicted.
			After a lengthened discussion
			Mr. HoweLU addressed the Bench on the part of the
			caurctwara-en, who, he said, was elected for the third time by the vestry on Easter Monday, and for two years had performed the duties of hls office to the satisfaction of
			is fellow parishioners and the public at lsrge. 1Mr. Thomp- son had been compUimented by the magistrates of that Court and by the public press fos the able manner In which he hsad performed his duties under the most trying circum- stances. 3r. Thompson did net collar or kick the com- plainant or use any violence. The vwitnesses severally de- daredl that the conduct of Mr. Adams wias calculated to lead to a breach of the peace.
			Mr. Henry Ashcroft, an elderly gentleman, said that hso really thought r. Adams was ont of hts mind an Sun- day evening, and thlat he shoved Mr. Thompson and several other persons.
			John Button, beadle of the parish of St. George, and a constable sworn in by the Commissioners of Police, said he beard the churchwarden call for the police in attendance to remove MIr. Adams from the altar-gates. He asked Adams to leave the place, and on his refusal took himn by the arm and led him away towards the rector's vestry, and said to him " I am very sorry, Sir, I bave the task of doing this, and laying hold of you." The defendant said, " Never minnd, I don't blame you or the churchwarden" When he returned to the communion Mr. Thompson was removing the people.
			lBy Mr. Serjeant Ballantine.-!r. Thompson did no' kek the complainant or collar him. I removed hlm from the nltar rails.
			Mr. YARDLEY summed up the case at cons{derable length. If Mr. Thompson had acted upon the feeltngs suggested and made use of his office of churchwarden as a cloak to gratify private malice, and assaulted Mr. Adams in the church, the case wsould have been one of very considerable aggravation, how- ever slight the assault. If it had been shown by strong evi- dence that had been so he should have sent the case to the Quarter Sessions; but, if the case were presented before a jury as it was presented to him, only one resudt would foDlow. There was no safe evidence that the defend- rat had been guilty of the nmean and improper act imputed to him ; and he should also fail In his duty if ho compelled Mrr. Thompson to be at the troible, expense, and Inconvenience of answerlng this charge at the sewsions, and also prolong and embitter the strife which existed. It was a new phase in the his. tory of these unhappy, these long-continued, irritating, tor- menting. despicable riots in St. George's parish that the person who, above 3ll others, ought to preserve order was charged vwith violating the sanctity of the church. He 3had more than once condemned the conduct of people who Indulged in miserable brawls and unjustifiable -rots in t-he church. but lie always took credit :for believing the churchwardens did all in their power fotmppress them, and he always believed 3Mr. Thompson w:s acting with perfect good faith, and acted with sound ind,nent and discrimination. It appeared to himn (Mr. XY.ar3ey) that it was done on the complainant's own notfon. He did not mean to say Mr. Adiams was antuated by improper motives, but he appeared to have overstepped the bounds of propriety,and to have taken upon Iisissli duties which more properly belonged to the church- wanden. Lf he had been in the churchwarden's place he ertainly w. uld not have entered into a controversy with such an jnipetuous young gentleman as Mr. Adams. He di ncut beliere any assanlt had been committed by the clsurchwarden on the complainant, and should therefore djsm,s3 the samnwns.
			Mlurmu.s of apsAt3nse followed the decision, wriich were speedily represed b,v the officers.

			TPHE BIGHT EON. JAMES WILSON ON]
			INDIAN CIVLE EXPENDITURB.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Mr. Wilson, in his budget spesel, when spaking of prospective retrenchment gavli it as his opinion that there was not only no rc,om for it in the civil establishment, but, on the contrary, that there was need of additional expenditure. "In no co-.ntqy of this world," said the right hon. gentle- man, "is a civil administration conducted at so small a cost." If the modest civil expenditure thus asserted have reference to the military expenditure, the comparison is evidently of no value whatever, since, India being a conquest of which we simply hold military occupation, the military expenditure must
			ecessarily far exceed in proportion the civil. If, on the contrary, the civil expenditure has reference to the rewards of the responsible functionaries who conduct the civil administration, it is very easy to show that the civil Government of India is the most extravagant that the world ever knew.
			The chief functions of the civil administration of India are carried on by a class of officers called " covenanted" servants, and these, present and absent, amount to about 1,000, and the number has not been increased for the last 40 years-in fact, in the same now with 150,000,000 subjects that it was with one-half that number; officers drawn from the army and an inferior grade of civil functionaries supplying the want. Their salaries are at present the same that were determined on near 70 years ago, when every one thought India a country of boundless wealth, and the sufficient proof of the reigning delusion Is to be found in the fact that holders of the monopoly of the patronage and trade of India at the time came under an engagement to the State (an engagement, of course, never ful6fied) to pay into the British Treasury the sum of 10,000,0001. for a new lease of 20 years. The patron- age of nomination to civil office was of course vested in the Directors of the East India Company, and the value of an appointment Is to be judged of by the fact that before a stringent Act of Parliament put an end to the public scandal, they were advertised in the London newspapers for sale, like an advowson, at 4,0001. apiece; and this was before furlough allow- ances and pensions had added to their value.
			A Parliamentary paper, published a few days ago, on Indian salaries will enable us to appreciate the value of MIr. WVilson's eulogy on the moderate cost of Tndian civil administration, and I shall here give a few examples from it. The salary of the Governor- General of India, including extras, is given at 37,8631., but this does not include the heavy ex- penses of himself and family in travelling (every Governor-Gcneral travels), all borne by the State, so that it is generally believed that the sumn total of his salary and contingencies is not short of 55,0001. This is elevenfold the salary of the President of the United States, and his office lasts a year longer. He is paid 5,0001. for his outfit and passage to India, which cannot now cost much more than that of any private gentleman, perhaps about one-tenth part of the alUowance.
			The salary of an Executive Councillor of India has been of late reduced from 10,0001. to 8,0001., and he has an outfit of 1,2001. Mr. Vilson is him- self an Executive Councillor, and, considering that he is In middle life, and has relinquished a good position, an ample salary, and fair prospects of ad- vantage at home, without, like others, a prospect of indian pension, I cannot think the salary excessive in his peculiar case. Bat, besides him, the Council consists of three other members, whose utility no living man can venture to affirm.
			Besides the Executive, we have a Legislative Council, consisting, besides ex officio members, of four paid ones, receiving each a salary of 5,0001., while their clerk has one of 3,0001. iMr. Wilson is an ex officio member of this Council, and his pre- sence with the special powers with which he has been invested by the Home authorities shows that at home the utility of the Council is at zero.
			But I have not done with the Councillors. Bom- bay and Madras have a pair apiece, each Councillor receiving a salary of 6,4001., while the Lieutenant- Governors of Bengal and the North-West Pro- vinces, with far larger populations to each, are found to do well enough without Councillors. The total cost of Councillors is about 80,0001. a year, and the Home Government, from all I hear, has come to the conclusion that in their multiplicity there is no wisdom, for it is contemplating a mea- sure to get rid of them.
			The Lieutenant-Governors of Bengal, the North- West Provinces, and the Punjab have salaries of 10,0001. each, which is about double the salary of a Governor-General of our largest colonies. These are recent appointments, but upon the old scale of expenditure. They have, moreover, retiring pen- sions, which no colonial Governor has.
			In subordinate offices there is the same scale of expenditure. The member of a revenue board in Beingal and the North-West Provinces has a salary of 5,000 . a year, and, as their number is five, they receive among them, therefore, as much as our First Lord of the Treasury and the four Secretaries of State. The agent for the opium monopoly in Behar has a salary of 4,2001. a year, a sum that would equal the salaries of seven collectors of the Customs or Inland Revenue in England. I admit, however, that in the case of this particular officer there has been of late years a great improve- ment in economy; for at one time his income was some 10,0001. a year, or, at tpe time, equal to that of an Indian Councillor.
			Indian political agents abroad, corresponding to our consuls, are p)aid on the same magnincent foot- ing. Thus the agent in the Persianl Gulf has 2,8001. a year, and he in Turkish Arabia 3,0001., tbe lowest of these sums beingT double the salary of a consul- genera-l, or even of a chkargi Wa,ffaiuies in South America.
			AR salaries in India are not, however, on so princely a scale, for we have some that are suffi- ciently humble; but then they are not held by a privileged order, but probably by some Asiatic Chris- tian or another. We have examples of this in the translators of the native langniages at Lladras. The translators of the Tamil and Telugoo languages have 3601. apiece, and be that translates two languages, the Persian and Hindi, the same sum for both. The transiators of the Canarese and MIalayalam have each only 3001., while the Director of Education has 10 times as much, although most probably un- equal to writing a single grammatical sentence in any one of the six languages enumerated.
			Now, I think it quite certain that, with our pre- sent better knowledge of India, and the conviction it must bring to every mind of ordinary reasoning powers of its being a very poor and not a rich country, the existing scale of salaries cannot be maintained, if India, instead of running us into debt and becoming a burden to us, is to be made to pay its own cost. Faith must be kept with the present holders of place, but to aU future aspirants due warning should be given that the rewards of Indian office must be reduced, to the level of those of other corresponding places in other parts of the worldL
			India, it should be remembered, is no longer the remote country it was when the existing scale of salaries was determined on. An Indian voyage was then rarely accomplished under six months' time, and it can now be performed with less discomfort and more economy in one-sixth part of the tlme, while some foreign necessaries and all foreign luxuries are at present to be had in India at one- half what they cost half a century ago. Mr. Wilson ought not to begin his c.reer of financial re- formation by deliberately hoodwinkinQ himself.

			TBE MILRDE;B s-lts MAD CIHEsTsm.-Yesterday Sarah S^holes, the daughter of William Scholes, and the stster of William Edward Scholes (the two men found mur- dered in har bedroom on the previous day), declared to a polceman that she had committed the murder. She said that her father and brother entered the room to beat her and she killed them in defending herself. She said she knocked her brother down with the walkingstick, and then throttled hium, and that afterwards she served her father in a simiar manner. Subsequently, before the magistrates, she denied that she knew anything of the matter. She appears to be in a state of Insanity, and, of course, no statement she may make at present can be relied upon.

			MR WISON'S BUDGET.
			TO THE EDIroH OF TE TIMESM.
			Sir,-If my old friend " J. (C." had not affixed those *nltials to the letter which you published yesterday I should have known It to be his by two marks, stamped upon all his writings plainly as" the broad arrow" upon a bolt of the Queen's canvas-firstly, a foli and accurate knowledge of the commerce and revenue of Singapore and Java, and, indeed, of every place within the limits of the Indian Archipelago; gecondly, gross misconceptions and blunders in respect to the corresponding affairs of continental India, and more especially the land revenue.
			Certainly, Mr. WFilson's speech, able and ingenious as it is, is open to some rldicule. I know Indla pretty well, and I have travelled through and sojourned in Belgium at least half-a-dozen times, and I cannot for the life of me see any greater similarity between the two countries than there is between Macedon and Monmouth; there Is the Scheldt in the one and the Ganges in the other. But it assuredly does not lie in " J. C.'e' mouth to ta- him with " mistakes cal- culated to excite the wonder of those who have made India their study," seeing that he has himself falen into errors quite sufficient to destroy one's confidence in his fitness to act the part of a critic of Mr. Wilson's financial scheme.
			There is, indeed, one contradiction in 3 J. C.'sP letter so gross and palpable that it requires some of that charity which " belueveth all things" to induce one to regard it as a mere mistake. He is anxlous to detract from Mr.Wilson's position, that the exports of India have greatly increased of late years; and therefore states that, "even from the value of the Indian exports, such as it Is, has to be deducted the tan on opium, not less than 4,000,0001., which is, of course, no more an export than our own tea and sugar duties are English imports." But half a column further on he states, with far more truth than consistency. that. " in so far
			as the opium revenue is concerned, he is quite right, for the tax is not paid by the Bindoos, but chiefly by the Chinese;" evidently meaning by the reservation, not that the Eindoos pay any part of the tax, but that the Alays and others slightly assist the Chlinese to that end. Nothing, however, Is easier than to show that the opium Is an export from India to the full extent of its value; for the purcbhsa money paid by the merchant in Calcutta, at the monopoly price, and the duty paid by the exporter at Bombay, are merely advances, to be afterwards repaid in fall, with no small additions, by the Chinese consumer; and every farthing of the proceeds, including, in one immp, cost of pro- duction, the revenue drawn from the drug by the Indian Government, and the profits of the merchant and the ship- owner, either comes back to India directly, or by the circuitous route of England, to which it is sent in the shape of tea or silk. This is something more like a substantial increment to the wealth of India than the additional price paid by the English consumer for his tea and sugar, on account of the import duty, Is to that of this country. How could "J. C." have been bold enough to attempt such a transparent mystification?
			But the land-tax is "J. C.'s principal stumbling block He says that Mr. Wilson strikes ont of the Indian taxation the entire land-tax ; In regard to which, he proceeds, "he is right, but in theory only, in so far as the settled districts are concerned, in which real landlords alone exist; a sentence not very easy to be construed. "Bnt the land- tax," he goes on, though he has just admitted the opposite doctrine to be lright, but in theory only," (precisely what our friends the farmers used to say about free trade), "but the land-tax, of whatever descrip- tion, is a real tax., for the State has not created the fand from which it is derived, and whlch, with- out the labour and interest (?) of individuals, never wonld have come into existence." And he then proceeds with the argamentum ad invid fam, " If the theory be good for exact- ing a nominal 2s. in the pound In England, it is equaUy good for taking the whole 202.-a fiscal doctrine which the noblemnen and gentlemen would hardly approve."
			Now, I am afraid that" J. C." is one of those who don't choose to understand the real character of the land revenue of Indzh. I rejolce to see that, on the other hand, Mr. Wilson not only understands the theory, but proposes to carry his knowledge Into practice. But he who runs may read and comprehend the facts of the case if he wi1L The simple truth Is, that the zemlndar or ryot (call him what you will) who pays rent to the Government In India can no more be sald to be taxed in respect to such payment than the farmerwho pays rent to his landlord in England. The difference between the two countries Is this :-We all know how matters stand at home. In India, by far the greater part of the rent of land has
			never, from time immemorial, been private property. It has always been the fund from which, with comparatively small exceptions, the whole of the expenses of the Euccessive Governments have been paid. The man who inherited or purchased land knew, as his fathers had known before him for thousands of years, that he acquired it eubject to a very heavy rentcharge; and though " J.C." talks (he must know better) of our "giving the proprietor only a periodical lease of his own property," and that " this arrangement has rmined many of them, made them disloyal, and the partlicipators or abettors of mutiny and rebeUion," the said proprietors no more regard the payment of revenue -when not excessive-as a tax or a hardship than a man in this country who holds land under the Crown, a corporation, or a colege, considers it to be a grievance that he is not the owner of the soil in fee simple, and that he has to pay an- nually a heavy quit-rent, or a still heavier fine when a life drops. There is no more real analogy between the land-tax of England and the land revenue of India than there is between a horsechesnut and a chesnut horse.
			But it must, says "J. C.," be " a real tax, for the State has not created the fend from which it is derived." Cer- tainly not. It is not the province or within the power of a State to create funds. But, if there be one truth in political economy more certain than another, it is that rent is the creature of society, for which the State-though it may become a tyrant and an extortioner-is properly only the steward and administrator; and what " arrangement "-to use"J. C.'s "own term-can be more reasonable and equitable than that, in a countrywhere rent has never been appropriated as private property (except as regards a smai portion), this society-created fund, which may be caUed a spontaneous gift of nature, after every person engaged in raising the fruits of the earth has been repaid both for outlay and toll, should be applied by the State, as the common trustee, to the purposes of societv, to defray the expense of armies, courts of justice, police (thiose necessary evils), or for roads, bridges, canals, and other objects of public utility ? How is it, &amp; priori, more unjust (though homebred Englih- men are used to a different state of things, and " J. C." panders to the preindice), that rent should belong to society in general, and be applied to general purposes essentialy necessary, and to supply which taxes must otherwise be raised, than that rent should belong to Lord A or Squire B., and that the whole commanity should be saddled with customs, excise, atamp duties, legacy and succession duties, and a property-tax of lId. in the 11. 9
			In fact, In India-as " J. C." ought to know, as he says that he has made that country his study, and thlinks that he is, therefore entitled to wonder and laugh at Mr. Wilson- the rent of the land, beyond a certain fraction, belongs just as much to the artisan of the viUage and to the merchant shopkeeper of the town as it does to the man who actuaUy tiDs the soil, or to any class, or aU the classes, more immediately connected with it. The real pro- prietor of the rent (not, mark you, of the land, which is as much private property as it is in England), is not the person whonm' -J. C." dresses up for the enoce, to steal, in this masquerade, the synspathies of the squirearchy of England, but the whole people of India, represented by the State as their trustee.

			HORRIBLE SUICIDE AT HIxGrsGATE.-OR Thursday afternoon, shortly before 4 o'clock, as some undertakers were rettrning from the Hlghgate Cemetery down Swaine's-lano they were suddenly alarmed by a tremendous report of fire- arms, and, on looking in the direction whence the re- port came, they saw the body of a man lying by the side of the road with his head literally shattered to atoms, no single vestige of feature remaining. Near the body lay a large horse-pistol, the barrel of which had exploded. It Is be- lieved that the unfortunate man had loaded the pistol to the very muzzle, and then disebsrged the contents Into his mouth. The body was placed in an undertaker's hearse and brought down to the dead-hoase of St. Pancras Workhones, where it remains for Identification, which can only be effected by the clothes and articles on the deceased's person. His dress consisted of a black surtout coat and wrapper, the onter of petersham or beaver cloth, with black velvet collar, black cloth double-breasted waistcoat and trousers, black patent leather " Balmoral" boots (nearly new), a blue figured and crimson stock. The shirt is of the new flannel material, striped black or brown and red; a white linen collar marked " C. Crane, No. 10," and white socks with blui
			stripe, also marked " C. Crane, 3'" On his person were found a card, with an address at Chelsea ; four deplicates, one for some trifling article pledged that morning for a shilling near Golden-square ;' a knife and razor, percussion caps, powder, bnllets, &amp;c., but no money. The body awaits an inquest.

			BRISTOL SUGAR-*aRKE;T, April 13.-The demand continues steady, especially for pan descriptions, and a fair businmess has been transacted here this week at about former rates. Refiners' produce has been in good demand, but rather lower prices have, in some instances, been ac- cepted. Rum more saleable, and business to some extent has been concluded in Demeraras at 2s. per proof gaRon.
			STEA31SHP-asuILDINQ ON THE CLyDa.-Several handsome new steamers have just been launched by builders in tho Clyde district. Messrs. T. Wiugate and Co. have turned out a paddle steamer named the Comercio, and In- tended for passenger traffic on the north coast of Spain. The Cromercio is 140 feet in length, and a pair of engines of 70- horse power are now being placed on board. Mesars. Wil- lam Denny and Brothers, of Dumbarton, have launched a screw yacht named the Margaretta Stevenson for Mr. AT. C. Stevenson, of Quebec. The yacht Is intended to be employed as a tender to Her Majesty's surveying ship in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and she is being engined by Messrs. Tulloch and Denny. A screw steamer of 500 tons has been launched from the building-yard of Mr. A. Denny, of Dumbarton. She is intended for the Glasgow and Londonderry trade, and will replace the Eagle, lost last winter. She has beennamed the Falcon, and is being fitted with 90-horse engines.
			THE SocIAL EvIL.-The efforts made by the gentlemen who originated the midnight meetings with a view of reseuing the unfortunate creatures who subsist by prostitation, and to raise them from their fallen state by means of opening reformatories for such as felt disposed to forsake their abandoned mode of life, have been hitherto very successful and encouraglng. On Thunrsday morning a ser- mon was preached in Bloomsbury Chapel by the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon on behalf of the society. The chapel was crowded, and the preacher was energetic in his appeal to the public for their co-operation and support. He pointed out very clearly that a great sin lay at the door of the male sex, aud that many a man who would consider it a disgrace to be seen by his fellows in the company of a poor fallen woman had been the seducer of some of those who now nightly wandered our streets. He pitied that man who could show no pity for the faUen, and he trusted that no effort would be spared on the part of the promoters of the Society for the Rescue of Young Women and Children to establish the institution on as extensive a scale as possible. Numerous applications had been made by those unhappy creatures who were agonized at their sunken state for ad- mission to a reformatory; but it was to be regretted that the very limited state of the funds shut the door against many of them. MIr. Spurgeon appealed to the congregation to show their sympathy by a liberal collection, which was responded to very satisfactorily. Upwards of 771. was given in support of the cause, for which the society is very grateul.
			PROGRESS OF GOVERMmET WornSs AND PUBLIC BuiLDINGS iN; 1859.-The repairs of Royal palaces cost during the year ending March, 1559, 47,23S?. 19s. lid., against 22.034Z. 12s. 4d. in the preceding year.

			QROBGB BOSM.%
			Vho vwas George Rose ? We find his name con- stantly occurring In the correspondence and bio- graphies that relate to the commencement of the present century, sometimes peering forth in the public history of the same period, and always turning up as that of au important personage. Everybody speaks familiarly and confidingly of
			George Rose. Walter Scott wants to find, out! something, and he applles to George Rose. Mr. Pitt is perplexed, and he must consult George
			Rose. The King wants the use of a house on his 1 road to Weoymouth, and he applies to George
			Rose. Lord MIarchusont lookss out for an executor,I and he fixes upon George Rose. The Duke of Niorthumberland w ants a lift from the Government, and he tries to secure the good offices of George Rose. Lord Auckland has set his heart on getting a peerage, and he unbosoma himself to George Rose. A sailor wanting his prize-money relies on the favour of George Rose. Lady Hamilton, urging her claims to be rewarded by the nationfor her service to Lord Nelson, deDends on the exertions of " her dear, good MIr. Rose." Everybody knows George Rose except the poor reader, who, as he takes up memoir after memoir of distinguished people, is for a long time at a loss to make out who is this ubiquitous being, who seems to be as mysterious as he is important. He knows every- thing, sees everything, does everything-the facto- tum of the universe, the intimate of every class, from the King in his madness to the sailor begging in his rags, a confidential sort of man with whom we all bank our secrets and our wishes. Who is he? 'What is he? Ancd how is it that he is always turn- ing up when he is wanted, and then vanishing with- out our being able to discover anything of himself ? We see in him a judicious, cautious, quiet, little man-always important but never obtrusive, always right but never troublesome, apt inbusiness, but apt also in silence. He has such a clear head and such a faculty of business combined with discretion that he inspires unusual confidence, and in whatever circumstances placed would, no doubt, have had troops of friends around him. But it so happens that he is the Secretary of the Treasury-he is Pitt's righthand man for 20 years, and there lies the secret of his influence. He is one of theworkingbees of office who put every- thing in train and do all the drudgery. Pitt wants to know the quantity of tea in bond-he sends for George Rose. He thinks of putting a war-tax on private brewing-he consults George Rose. He is anxious about the corn crop, and makes Inquiries of George Rose. He wishes to arrange the terms of the next loan, and must have the opinion of George Rose. For 20 years the Premier who, the greater part of that time, was not only Premier, but in some respects also the entire Government, had these confidential relations with George Rose, and thence grew confidential relations between other parties and the indefatigable Secre- tary. The post which he occupied, if it was a subordinate one, was yet of enormous importance when held continuously for nearly 20 years under the most powerful Prime Minister that we have had since the days of Walpole. Pitt was often inacces- sible; he was a bad correspondent; his mind was absorbed in publc affairs; he was op- pressed with care. If one could not get at him, the next best thing, was to get at the Secretary of the Treasury, and the " dear, good Mr. Rose" was the patent letter-box and concealed ear-trumpet to the Premier-the mediator, the adviser, the giver of hints, the friend indeed to the friend in need. We want the biograply of such useful characters. NVe want to see how the nmachine of Government goes, how the great wheels work into the little wheels, and how curious cogs and levers which are out of sight play an important part of which we take no account. It seemns as if from the biography of these hardworking useful men we should know more of the actual state of affairs than from memoirs of more imposing personages, who are concerned only in great results, and are not always mixed up in the small details from which these grand results follow. We therefore open these memoirs of a man the most distinguished of his class-one who had ex- traordinary opportunities of knowing all that was going on, and shedding valuable light on transac- tions that are by no [means clear; we open these memoirs we say with great expectations.
			Our expcctations have been disappointed. Per- haps that very quality of discretion which made George Rose so necessary to his friends effectually precluded the possibility of any ex;traordinary reve- lations. He was a man that sucl.ed in every thing and let out nothing. le got a story, he bottled it up, but he never again took the bottle out of his celar. His Diaries perfectly reflect the man. He wrote these Diaries for the use of his children, but he anticipated theprobability of their falling into other hands, andhe took care to avoid any unnecessary disclosures. He is prolix, he expresses himself in roundabout phrases, he is mysterious, he avoids anecdotes, he retails no scandal, he never coramits himself, he gives arguments rather than facts. We already know almost all that he has to tell us-and in his journals we are regaled not with new matter, but with ex- tremely judicious explanations of the reasons why this occurred and why that did not occur, explana- tions, which in most cases are quite unnecessary. Along with the Diaries is published a great mass of correspondence of the genuine official sort. The greater number of these letters are not written by him but to him, and relating for the most part to public questions do not throw much light upon them. Official people get into the wav of writing not letters but epistles-heavy, sensible, voluminous composi- tions into which no ray of wit penetrates, and in which the idea is embedded like a needle in a hay- stack. In the whole of the correspondence here pub- lished there is but one letter which is at all pleasant, and shows that the writer could enjoy life as well as transact business. Itis written by Sir William Grant from Paris towards the close of 1815, informs ]Vr. Rose that there are no less than four Masters in Chancery at the moment in the French metropolis, and quotes Jekyll's saying, that when the Duke of Wellington discovered them he took them for an- tiques stolen from England, and insisted on having them cased up and sent back at the time of the general emia1Uage. Every other letter in Mr. liar- court's two volumes is on the business of the nation, and appears to be written with official pens, on official paper, at official desks, by gentlemen with powdered hair and in Court dresses, who commence their correspondence by referring gratefully to " your communication bearing date the 3d inst.," and who end it by an assurance that they are the most humble, the most obedient, and the most faithful servants of the person they are addressing, it may bo a very close friend and ally. We have an enormous mass of correspondence here which we can only read with amazement, not knowina why it is published. It would be difficult to say why the greater part of these letters should be published, even in biographies of the persons who wrote them. It is impossible to way why they are published in memoirs of Mr. Rose. It is true that for the most part they are addressed to Mr. Rose, but that is a strange reason for publish- ing them in a work devoted to the Secretary of the Treasury,when wedonot evenobtainat thesametime the answers which he wrote. We have lettersof Lord Macartney and of Captain MIackintosh to Mr. Rose relating to the China question. We have all the letters of Lord Percy begging for some appreciation of his merits from the Government. We have a long correspondence of Lady HEamilton's regarding Nelson and Nelson's daughter. We have letters of the Princess of Wales and many more. It is very pleasant to reflect that MIr. George Rose was on such confidential terms with such distinguished persons, but this is all that the letters prove. We hope it is not treason to say that persons of distinc- tion can write very stupid letters. The present series is singularly barren of useful information, and the editor has committed the mistake of imagining that because the originals are valuable as autographs they are therefore valuable for publica- tion. Perhaps, if he were better acquainted with the history of the period over which these Diaries and correspondence extend he would not have fallen into such a mistake, and would have seen that his materials are threadbare. A writer who tells us that Canning was ready to desert his colours and join the Grenville Mlinistry can scarcely be ac- quainted with the fact that Canning peremptorily refused to join that Ministry unless accompanied by his party. A writer who supposes that Sheridan's saying about the Whigs building up a wall for the express piurpose of running their heads against it refers not to the events that caused a dissolution of the Grenville MIinistry, but to the events that kept the WVhigs frora office on the death of Perceval, has

			made a mistake in onle of the most notorious of facts. We could mention other dips, but we prefer to thank Mr. Harcourt for at !est not troubling us with many reflections. If hia work displays no great] acquaintance with the secret history of the period to which it refers, it is done nearly as well as this sort of work is generally done; md, ff we are not much edified by the information which the editor baa to give, we are at least grateful that he gets through his work as fast as possible.
			Who is George Rose? we agan ask, and our readers wills perhaps, feel a greater interest in him if we name some of his descendants before we speak of his parentage. Sir Eugh Rose, who won golden
			hopinions in the late Indian campaign, and who is spoken of as the successor of Lord Clyde in the com- mand of the Indian army, Is his grandson. Sir
			roGeorge Rose, fatherof Sir ugh, and for many years our representative at the Court of Berlin, wcas his son. another soniwas tilliam Stewart Rose, who wrote Letters from the North of Italy, addressed ,o Eenry Eallam, and who, spite of his father's Toryism, had a literary intimacy with MIoore and Byron. The Georgeo Rose whose correspondence is n ow before us w.as born in 1744, somewhere in Scot- land, his father belonging to the Roses of Eilravoc, in Nairashire. Probably the family w ere not very wvell off, for at the age of four he was adopted by his uncle on the mother's side, who was then living at HRampatead, and was making his way as teacher of a school where young Rose was educated. One of his daughters, who contributes some menoranda to the present work, states that her father was for a short time sent to Westminster School, but Mlr. Rose in his autobiography makes no mention of tbis. He was at an early age sent to sea, but after thiree or four years of the navy he discovered that he had not much chance of promo- tion, and on the peace of 1763 he quitted the ser- vice. He steered one of the boats from which the troops, commanded by the Duke of Alarlborough, were, in 1758, landed in Cancale-bay, and, had Mlr. Thackeray been aware of the fact, he would pro- bably have made use of it in the account of that exploit which he has given in the Virginians. On returning to England young Rose found himself in great perplexity. His uncle was dead, and the bequest of 5,0001., which he expected to inherit from him, was nowhere to be found. He could obtain no trace, either of his uncle's property or of his uncle's wmill; and he had to look to friends for assistance and advice. The one who seems to have done most for him was Alexander Strahan, who was at this time considerably ad- vanced in years, who took him into his house, and who introduced him to Dr. Johnson, lume, mrs. Macauley, and other celebrities of the literary world. It was probably by Strahan's advlco that George Rose now devoted himself to the study of records, and through Strshan's influence that he was appointed a clerk in the Record-office. In 1772 he was made Keeper of the Records, an office which he retained to the last. In 1777 he was appointed Secre- tary of the Tax-office, and was frequently consulted during the latter part of Lord North's Administra- tion on business connected with his department. When Lord John Cavendish became Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Rose suggested to him a mea- sure for the consolidation of the Customs, which Pitt afterwards adopted. We see him thus gradu- ally rising into confidence, until at last we hear of Lord Shelburne sending for him to obtain from him some information relating to the revenue, and at the end of the conversation asking him what were his future views. Rose replied that he was anxious to obtain the reversion of the office
			of Clerk of Parliaments. "'Good God M 3Ir. Rose," said Lord Shelburne, "have you not more ambi- tion ? " To show his own estimate of Rose, when he becamne head of the Administration he at once offered the Secretaryship of the Treasury to the mn- ambitious Secretary of the Tax-office, and it was reluctantly accepted, for it implied the giving up of a moderate certaintv for a splendid uncertainty. Mr. Pitt, who was Chan;cellor of the Exchequer in the Shelburne Administration, had many opportunities of seeing George Rose, and afterwards a cordialitywas established between them, when both determined to break with Lord Shelburne who had brought them together. In the end of 1783, when Pitt entered upon his first Administration, G1eorge Rose was again appointed Secretary to the Treasury, and in this post he was of essential service to the Heaven-born
			Iinister, perhaps, of all others, the man whom he trusted most. It is said that he it was who first conceived the idea of putting down smuggling and improving the public revenue by diminishing the duties exacted at the Cnstom-office; that he produced an enumeration of the inhabitants of the island, and demonstrated the immense in- crease of the population; and that he it was who placed the propertv of Friendly Societies under the protection of the laws. Whatever be his merits in originating measures,there can be no doubt as to the excellence of his business habits. Always indus- trious, always punctual, always minute, always col- lected, and always happy, he was a most valuable assistant, and exercised a vigilant control over every detail that came before him, which was of immense value to Pitt, who was sometimes apt to overlook details in thinkling of results. In this post. at the right hand of " the pilot who weathered the storm," he remained for 17 years; and when he returned with his idol to office in iS0t, it was to become Vice- President of the Board of Trade and Joint Pay- master of the Forces. On the death of Pitt and the overthrow of his Cabinet, Rose, of course, went out of office and remained in Opposition during the reign of "All the Talents." The following year, with the Duke of Portland, he returned to place, being made Treasurer of the Navy, which office he held up to the day of his death, in January, 1818, when he was suceeded by Mr. Prosperity Robinson. It was on his being appointed to the Treasurership of the Navy, in 1807, that Lord Palmerstonentered upon office for the first time in a post which had some con- nexion with that of Rose, for he became a Lord of the Admiralty. W5Vhen the Duke of Portland resigned and Perceval succeeded, Canning was grievously disappointed that Rose consented to remain in office, and did not ratler choose to follow the fortunes of his friend. Porceval, on the other hand, desired to reward the adhesion of Rose by giving him the Chanicellorship of the Exchequer, a post which he declined, knowing that in the absence of Perceval he would have to lead the House of Commons, a duty for which he felt himself incom- petent. He preferred to remain Treasurer of the
			Navy, even though at the same time, to his great disgust, Croker was appointed Secretary to the Admiralty. "HBe is an honourable man, I believe, and certainly has talents, but," says Rose, in his mild way which means an im mense deal, " there is a something belongina to him that males me much regret the selection." It was perhaps a pity that an arrangement could not have been made to secure Rose as our finance Miinister, for be knew more about the subject than any other man in the House of Commons, and he was most anxious to reduce the public expenditure and introduce various economical reforms. Had he been more confident of Iss own pow-ers he might have figured more prominently in history, and we should not at the end, as all through his career, have the echo of Lord Shelbumre's criti- cism in our ears, " Good God! Mr. Rose, have you not more ambition 7" As it is, we see in him but a zealous subordinate-a man who did his work thoroughly, but was afraid of responsibility- an honest, hard-working, thoroughly reliable muan, -who commanded success but never tempted for- tune. Of his private life woe know almost nothing. From the tone of his autobiography and diary w;e might indeed conclude that he had no private life, and that he was a calculating machine. It is by the merest chance we discover from the present volumes that he was married, that he had children, that his whole heart was given to them, and that they were devoted to him. He pushes forward his eldest son with the greatest anxiety, he is aelighted when people praise him, he is especially delighted when the King praises him because he is so like his father in the qualities of his mind. It is with difficulty that we glean these few particulars of his private life from the mass of less interesting, although more public details. Rose was very retiringa; and we cannot give a better instance of what he was in this respect than by referring to tbe part he took in assisting to pay the debts of Pitt. About 12,0001. were subscribed by Pitt'e friends to help him out of his difficulties, Rose and so many more giving I,000O. each. Pitt made a memorandum of this on his deathbed, mentioning the names of all -who had subscribed 1,0001., with the exception of Rose, for whom he substituted another name. Probably it was the result of his own delicacy with Pitt, but he naturally felt mortified that he wras the only one of the great statesman's intimate friends whose reg7ard for him as displayed in this wasy was unknown.
			It is quite in keeping with such an occurrenIce,
			and with the whole character of George Rose, thab although his name appeasm on the title-page of the presnt worlk, it is there only by courtesy. We have Georgo Rose's autobiography, his diary, his letters, the letters of his friends; but it is scsrcely
			an exaggeration to say that George Rose is nowhera t in these volume_. He appears but as the satellite of Pitt. He shines by Pitt'3 liaht; that he live3 seems to be a favour of Pitt's. It is Pitt's policy that is discussed, Pitt's savings that are quoted Pitts wishes that are respected. The reader oi thisworkwill not get many newfacts to illustrate the career of the great statesman, but if anybodywould liketo understand the sort of influence that Pitt ex- erted over his contemporaries we could recom- maend him to no publication that would show this more vividly than the present. We see here the tremendous pressure of Pitt on every man who came mnto contact with him. All his friendi loved him ; they could not help loving him. They never saw him out of temper; he was alwayskind, forbearing - he never thought of himself; hethoughtorlyof ther public service; but his mastery of everybody around himn assuprme. Hehwastirresistible; he dido hat. ever he liked with them; they were it his hands as clay im the hands of the potter. At times we might even call this deference to the Premier slavish, did
			ve not l;now that there was notbing slavish in
			the men who showed such deference. Let us call it rather something magnetic, some- thing magicaL WVhatever it was, Pitt had only to lift up his little finger and oppositio ;was hushen before him; he had only to lay his hand on a friend's shoulder, and that friend wa2s clean gone for ever. He made no attempts of this kind-als that he did came naturally and without effort. He rather neglected society, he was a bad correspond- ent, he was not much troubled if people thought him a little rude; even those who kinew him intl- matelywere inclined to complain of Pitt's inattention to them and to fear that their god did not care for them. It required but a word and every one was at Pitt's feet. There 7as somethmig miraculous, about the man. When the Coalition ibnistry was formed it seemed as if he were shelved for ever, andi would have to take his blue bag and return to the bear. In an incredibly short space of tlime tha Coalition ras blown to pieces, and Pitt, a mere youth, was at the heaid of a Government which he conducied in the House of Commons with consum- mate ability through 17 most anxious years. Thera was that nbout him vhich, apart from his abilities,
			drew friends to him-wle refer to his perfect un- selfishness and to a sweetness of disposition wrhich nothing could sour. With regard to his disin- terestedness and integrity, it is notorious that ine period of corruption, when he miht easily havea made his fortune, he made no provision for himself, while for the country he abolished all con- tracts vrhatever, all purchases by co mmission, all private distributions of loan, and every other species of money influence.
			Apart from the fact that in thess memoirs we have in a general ray pourFrayed very firidly the immense force with which Pitt dominated over asU
			his friends, the various papers now published cannot be said to convey any remarkable information. One point they confirm, indeed, w hich scarcely needed confirmation-namely, the fact of Pitf'spacilic in- tentions with regard to France. It is perfectly clear, in documents with which every one who has studied the history of that period must be farmliar, that the policy of this country was strictly a policy of non-intervention. Whatever the more rabid Tories might have uttered-and these no doubt gave expression to foolish hopes, just as rabid democrats gave expression to foolish desires of an opposite kind-the language of Ministers was consistent in deprecating a warvwith France on the ground of French opinions. It was stated in the strongest terms that it was no business of ours to interfere with the internal arrangements which the French people might chooso to adopt for their Government; that it was no wish of ours to invade France ; that if we resorted to war, it would be only as a defensiva measure to save our dominions and to nrntect
			our allies. But Wzhig historians and 1Radical orators, wisbing the former to find excuse for the miserable position in which Fox found him- self when he opposed the war, and the latter to condemn war altogether, as the pastime of aristocrats waged at the expense of a suffering and reluctant people, are disposed to reply,-" These were but public professions, which did not represent the real intentions of .iUnisters. Your Pitt and your Gren- viDe might prate of peace, but did they really wish it?2 They might talk of non-intervention, but did they reallymean it�. They might boast that they were fighting against the revolution not as revolution-only as aggression, hutt was not the end of the war the restoration of the Bou-bons " It is almost useless against such arguments to show that again and again Pitt offered to make peace with Napoleon and leave him in undisturbed possession of the French throne, provided he would consent to the ancient limitations of the French territory. The true reply is to be found in the private letters which passed in all confidence between the leaders of the English Government. If Pitt's pacific views were not suffliciently clear in his public acts of 1792, when he repealed taxes and reduced the naval establishment, they are explicitly stated in his letter to the Marquis of Stafford (Nov. 13, 1792), when he expresses a hope that " some opening may arise which may enablo us to contributo to the termi- nation of the war between different Powers in Europe, leaving France (which I believe is the best way) to arrange its own internal affairs as it can." Pitt's anxiety to conclude a peace in 179(6 was so marked that the King observed of the rmission on which Lord Malmesbury had been despatched with this object, " I am extremely glad the business is in Lord MIalmesbury's hands, and not in those of a friend of ours (meaning Pitt), who would have begun by yielding up everything." The more we read of Pitt's private correspondence and hear of his private feelings, the more we are convinced of his perfect honesty, see that his public measures were a reflex of his secret convictions, and are assured that he was not saying one thing and meaning another. There is scarcely any difference between the Pitt of public life and the Pitt of private life, the orator who rose in St. Stephen's to pro- pound a policy, and the friend who, as he passed the port wine, felt stil that the helm of the State was in his hands. 'e ask any candid man to compare Pitt's policy and patriotism with the policy and patriotism of Fox as revealed both in his publc speeches and in his private letters, of wlich the following is a characteristic specimen. "The truth is," says MIr. Fox in a letter to Grey, "I am gone something furtherinhate to the English Government than perhaps you and the rest of my friends are, and cer- tainly further than can with prudence be avowed. The triumph of the French Government over the Engish does, in fact, afford me a degree of pleasure which it is very difficult to disguise." It is not won- derful that the man who entertained such sentI- ments found himself before long in painful isola- tion; he lost his party, and he never recovered the influence which be throw away in forgetting that if he was a WVhig he was also an Englishman. He had a policy which he concealed, as well as one which he confessed. Ho was in a false position, and the greatest homage to the Pitt policy that could be rendered was that which Fox: rendered on his deathbed when he declared thal peace with France was impossible-that war was inevitable.

			TonAcco s- A TEA-srr3.-A very serlons case came before the city bench of magisttes on Wednesday last. Two young fellows-John Palmer, a mll. wright at Mr. Bell's, and Matthew Martin, In the employ of Mr. Nelson-went intothe Lion andLBmb Inn, in this city, on Sunday afternoon to get something to drink, or to *ro the girls. They were in the kitchen, and it was abont tea- time. After putting the tea-kettle npon the fire, one of tho sErvant girls went upstairs to clean herself, and during her absence the prisoner Palmer lifted the lid of the kettle, and dropped somne twlst tobacco Into the water. Ten persons had their tea made of this poisonons and dls- gnsting mixture, and in consequence thev were all severely attacked with sickness and vomiting. The case of the land- lady, Mrs. Uilburn, was very serious-to fse Mr. Mllburn's words to the magistrates, " They thought she would have died." Happily the chUdren got milk that afternoDn, other- wise this exceedingly foolish joke mlght have had a fatal end. Mr. Milburn resolved to prosecute the prisoners. When tbo law books were bronght out, however, end wvhen It was found that the case was not withln the jurisd!ctlonof the Bencb, hatmnstgoto tbe assizes, and that the prisoners were liable to be imprisoned for years, Mr. MIbuTn said be would not push things to that extremity. He had no reason to suppose the young men had done the act through malice, and ho hoped that It would serve as a caution to tbem. The mayor, in dlsmilIng them, said they were under a great obligation to Mr. Milburn for his for- bearance, and polnted out the critical position they had brought themselves Into by their slly fresak.-Carlial Ex- ainincr.

			SOLRBY.MA-RTand C1T'YITNBLLIGEB.NR.
			TXESDAY EVUN7G.
			The quotation of gold at Paris is about at par, and the short exchange on London is 26.15 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with tho English Mint price of 3L. 17s. 10d. per ounce standazid, it appears that goid is about 1-10th per cent. dearer in Paris than in London.
			By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 422k per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13.3, per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the Engglish Mfint price is therefore at about the same price in London and Hamburg.
			The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 108i to 108 per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the ex- change is against England. But, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the
			transmission of goold between the two countries.I
			The English 7inds opened this morning with a slight tendency to improvement, which w.as sus- tained at the close after a short temnporary re- lapse. Consols for money were first quoted 94a
			to J. They then declined to 941 to i, but ulti- mately returned to 94i to 9 for moneyf and 941 to , for the account. The general operatons were unimportant, Mloney was in good demand at the Bauk and elsewhere. In the Stock-Exchange hov'ever, short loans were offered at 3. to 4 per cens. Reducel and New Three per Ceits. left off at 927~ to 9?": Bark Stock, 224 to 226 ; India Stock. 218 t^ " Indfi^ Five per Cents., 105; the P.'.pea 56per - v' 1 to 104; Five per Cents. tc
			; India:_. * 6a. discount to pa.r; an. quer-biUs, 8s. to 12s. premium.
			A fair business has been transacted in foreiga stocks, and pricea generaUy remain without altera- tion. Turkish Six per Cents. were last quoted 754 to 761 ex. div. old, and 61i?, to i new,; Mexican, 21 to ';- and Brazilian Scrip, i dis. to par. Dutch Twvo-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 66; Brazilian Five per Cents. for the account, 984; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Scrip, par; Chilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., SGk; 31exican, for the account, 21a and 4; Portuguese, 42 ; for the account, 42k; Russian Three per Cents., 641; Sar- dinian, for the account, S3 j3; Spanish, 46.j; De- ferred, forthe account, 35 and 34-; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 5 7 and 76. ex div.; N7ew LXoan, 61k; and for the account, 61.
			The final price from Paris this evcning was 69f. 9Oc., showging no alteration.
			In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generaly exhibit a further slight advance.
			There was no withdrawal of gold from the Bank to-dav.
			The Peninsular and Oriental steamer Massilia, to sail on Thursday with the Bombay mail, will take 2,0001. in gold for Alexandria and 26,0001. in gold and 219,9651. in silver for Bombay.
			The Calcutta exchange to-day shows an adverse movement of about 1 per cent., the quotation being 2s. 1id., but at Shanghai there has been a decline to 6s. 41d., showing a favourable turn for this country equal to nearly 2 per cent. At Hong- kong also there has been a decline of about X per cent., the present rate being 4s. 9id. Shipments of saltpetre were restricted, the prices from this side not prosenting an advance sufficient to cover the in- creased rate of export duty. Disturbances among the ryots in some of the districts of Lower Bengal had arisen in connexion with the indigo question, the ryots being unwilling to fulil their contracts for supplying that article, owing to other crops being more remunerative, and to their having ascertained that its cultivation cannot be legally enforced.
			The adjudication of the new issue of 2,650,000!. 6 per cent. debentnres of the colony of Victoria is to take place to-morrow (Wednesday). The mini- mum price has been fixed in the colony on a scale
			to vary according to the quotation of Consols, and;. there are consequently a number of sealed papers from which a selection is to be made, the range being adapted to any price of Consols between 90 and 96, and a distinct paper being allotted for every half per cent. variation. Hence, to-morrow the paper that will have to be opened will be the one marked from 94 to 94�.
			The accounts from the east of the state of the markets for manufactured goods are not such as to inspire confidence in the entire soundness of the enormous trade at present carried on from this country. It is alleged by experienced merchants in London that, according to their latest advices, cotton manufactures from England cannot be sold except at a loss of 15 per cent. at Bombay, 10 per cent. at Calcutta, and 7 or 8 per cent. in China, and, moreover, that there has been no real profit on any such goods shipped hence during the last six months. Looking at the fact that the consignments now going forward are on a scale larger than has ever previously been known, these assertions must create great disquiet. They admit, however, of qualification in a very important man- ner. Although the buyer of M1anchester goods for exportation to India and China may expose himself to the losses in question, it does not follow that the MIanchester manufacturers who ship on their own account may not still be operating at a profit, since a sacrifice of from 7 to 15 per cent. may fail to absorb the entire gain between the current price of their goods and the cost at which they are actually turned out. The speculative shipper, therefore.
			who buys the goods at a quotationi includingtthe manufacturer's profit, is mainly the person whose transactions are to be contemplated with anxiety. Can it be shown that the condition of the markets is not such as is alleged, and that goods bought in Manchester will not only bring back full returns after paying freight, commissions, discounts, and all charges, but will also yield a fair remunerative surplus ? The ma,gnitude of the matter is such that a more momentous inquiry was never raised in the commercial world, and if the answer should be unfavourable we shall be driven to the suspicion, or rather to the conviction, that the lesson of 1857 has already been discarded. Happily, if the prices in India are, as is believed, even now suffi- ciently high to cover the prime cost of the manu- facture, the trade will yet prove to have caused no absolute impoverishment to this country; but the visions of unbounded profits which at present dazzle all who contemplate the monthly totals of our cotton exports will inevitably be dispelled, and the crash must faU somewhere. It will be shared, perhaps, partly by such of the manufacturers as may have sold their goods to speculative mer- chants on six months' acceptances, partly on such banks as may now be congratulating themselves upon the extraordinary revival in the discount busi, ness of the country, and partlyon tbe general public, who may as yet see no reason to distrust any of the new and dashing gentlemen who are rapidlY rising up into the position of great promoters of Eastern commnerce. The temptation created by the compe- tition for bills by the various banking establishments under the system of allowing interest on deposits; the facilities afforded by the long dates over which Indian transactions are spread before their actual results are brought to the test; and, finally, the advantage which the system of friendly assignments and windings-up under inspection give to every ad- venturous character who may have the adroitness to carry on business for two or three Years on a
			scale that will admit ot private appropriations and marriage settlements, are considerations that may excuse a suggestion for vigilance even at a moment when the whole country is revelling in a sense of prosperity. The repetition of the fact observable in 1857, that, vwith all our wonderful trade, the ten- dency of our bullion returns shows that we are spending rather more than we earn, while the advance in the rate of discount has no perceptible effect in checking the demand, coupled with the circumstance that the note circulation duriig the past twelve months has been frequently 10 per cent. in excess of its normal amount, are signs of some exceptional influences. which, at all events, are wortby of attention.
			The following relates to the two great Canadian railway companies -
			i Sir.-I have read your warning that notwithstanding the bright statements held out by the direc'tors, your readers should regard rather as "anxious speculateons" than as "investments which cannot faU to increase greatly in value " their shares in the Grand Trunk of Canada and Great Western of Canad3 Railways.
			" Surely yon mnust be informed as to the particulars of the agreement of peace between these two companies when you express misgivings of its long continuance. If so, yon would render a real service to the shareholders by publiabin" and explaining them. At neither of t.he recent ;meetlngs"have the directors given a single detail en this point. i1lumear, however, has circulated an outline, and, if it is correct, I cannot help thinking that the conditienzs Vill prove In operation so exceedingly keen an d grasping on ione side and so exceedingly the opposite en the other, sO I absolutely destitute of that substantial fairness whihch alone
			can make such agreementsperminent, that Itcanmot possibly endutre.
			Your statement of the Grand Trank annual liabilities does not reach the truth; one Item you have probably omitted Is 31,5001. for the rent of the line in Michigan, which it is proposed to lease at 7 per cent., notwithstanding the agreement of peace, under the terms of which, when operated and analyzed, I have a very strong sspicdon all the net earnings of that line, if any such there be, and all or nearly 5111 the p,rofets o� the grand Trnnlc line west of Toronto wiD find their way into the treasury of the Grt WVestern Company.
			" If what I hear be true, tbs agreement is a thorough curiosity from Its oneided char.cter. Is it too much to say that the shareholders of both companies ought to have been consulted before it became a contract ? One thing it proves (if It proves anything), viz., that of the two parallel hues from Toronto toDetroit (230 miles) one only need have been made. Hight not one of them he even now shut up fora few years, to the great saving of workingexpenses, and a0l the traffio be conducted over the other?
			" Yours, &amp;.,
			"A SHAREHOLDER IN ONlE OF THE CO01
			PANIES."
			In the first clause of the new Stamp Act, which relates to foreign bils of exchange, there is some obscurity as to the meaning of the words, "All such bills as shall after the passing of the Act be first negotiated-" but, according to the authorities at Somerset kouze, the intention of the Act is, that any foreign bill which arrived in this country and was stamped by the holder previously to the passing oi the Act, and of which proof can be given, will not be subject to the new duty. UJnder a differont and erroneous reading of the Act manv bill which did not require the noMw duty havc had additional stamps placed upon them; and, as in some cases they amount to a considerable sum, it is hoped that the Stamp- office will allow for F'-ih stamps, upon the exhibition of the bills, accompanied with evidence of their having been dulv stamped prior to the 3d of April.

			STATB OP TRADB.
			LEEDS, APRIL 10.-The markets in the cloth-halls to- day have been of a quiet character, and a comparatively limited amount of basiness has been done. Not only have the Easter holydays kept away some buyers, but the weather yet smacks so much of winter that goods lately purchased for spring wear do not pass very rapidly into use; hence new stocks are not required. Good plain blacks, firm union cloths, and the higher priced fancies, with rifle cloths, are in most request. The manu- facturers continue in full work, and the operatives are re- ceiviaz fair wages. Stocks, although they have rather in- creased of late, are within a moderate compass. Wool, both for clothing and combing parposes, is firm in price, and the local brokers are doing a fair amount of business,
			MANCHESTER, 10TIr.-The demand for goods con- tinues rather inanimate, and prices are without change since last week. In some cases, where contracts aro nearly worked out, there is less firmness, but in most departments the feeling seems a little more cheerful than it was. Tele- graphio accounts from Calcutta to the 22d ult., and from Bombay to the 23d, report an itmprovement in the demand at both places, and in some cases an advance in quotatloen. This has caused a slightly improved inquiry for those markets, and a stiffening of p rices. The came has been the effect with yarns for the East. In other respects, though the de. mand for goods and garns is fiat, prces cannot be quoted lower. Buyers for the Continent continue to hold aloof, owing to the polities1 uncertainty. The following is from the circular of Messrs. G. Tracer, Son, and Co.:-
			To-day's market is ratber quiet, and with bat Uttle business doing. We cannot quote say change in prices. but In some few cores they are rather weater. India goods. however, remain firm, and improved advise are reported from %ombay and Ohine."
			Messrs. J. Slagg and Co. report as follows
			" There has been a better demand for India shirUtngs to-day, owing to the recelpt, by telegraph. of improved accounts both from Bombay aud Calcutta; but the amomunt of boniness In them has been much meotristed by the extreme prices asked. For other descrlDtlona ths demand couttcues very iuantmate, as buyers, generaUy, are holding back In expectatlon of a slgbt decline In prices."
			ROOCHDALE, 9r. -There was but a poor market for flannel to-day. Saxonies are In fair demand, but Welsh and Lancashire flannels are, as usual at this intermediate season, tnt in slow request. GeneraUy the manufacturers are well employed, but orders on hand are not large. Nor in wool has there been much done to-day. Prices, how- ever, are steady, holders declining to make any abatement from the currency of the past suonth.

			A1tCHITEC=TRAL EXIIBITION.-The annual exhi- bition of architectural models and designs at the rooms in Conduit-street was opened to the public last nlght. A large and brilliant assemblage of ladles and gentlemen in evening dress crowded the galleries. The number of contributions Is not so large as in previous years, but in point of quality the exhibition may be said to reach the average standard. It certainly does not exceed it, and the names of seve- ral well-known architects wilU be missed with regret from the list of contributors. Mr. Scott is represented only by a few photographs of his drawings for the new Foreign-office, and Mr. Thomas Allom exhibits his designs for the Manchester Assize Courts. There are masterly dravwings by Mr. Di,by Wyatt, beattiful etchings by Mr. Street, and designs in almost every style and for aiost every kind of building by other eminent hands. It may be mentioned that the committee have made arrangements for the delivery of a series of interesting andinstruetive leotures during the present and ensuing months. The arrangement of a Roman consular house, the battle of the styles, the com- parative progress of English and French architecture, the application of Gothic architecture to civil and dom]estic buidings, and the dsscoverles of the Rsdrsam expedition, are among the subjects to be handled by able and competent lecturers. It will not be the fault of the committee if the present season do not prove a satisfactory and "-ofitable one -satisfactory to themselves 3nd proftab nd toftable o- feesion.

			RLWA Y INTELLIGENCE.
			DTrlTnAT, AND ENN\TISK BN.
			An extraordinary meetlng of thls company was held on Saturday in Dublin, for the purpose of considering anagrce- ment for lesslng the Loedondeny and Fmnnisillen Railway; the Earl of Erae in the chair.
			3Mr. MaCRosRY read the agreement nuder whiech the lease ws to be made, which provided for the payment to the Londonderry and lEnnskulen Company of a yearly rent of 20,0001. a-year, and If, after the 31st of December, 1882, the gross recedpts on the two lines, exclusive of the Clones and Cavrn. branches, should exceed the sum of 95,000t. for the year, then 20 per cent. of the excess would be added to the rent until it amounted to 33,0001., but it vas not to exceed this amount; and it was also stipulated that the rent should be paid weel-ly, clear of all deductions except income-tax.
			The CaaIRmN, in movlng a formrl resolution approving the agreement, and authorizing the directors to carry tho same into effect, stated that the directors were anxious to take any blame if there were any, connected vith taking the lease of the ion donderry and Enniakillen Railway. Ho was, in fact, most anxious to carry out that arrangement. He then explained the advantages that would probably ariss from the vworking of the two undertaldngs as one. The arrangement had been agreed to by the share- holders of the Londonderry and Ennisidllen Company, and it only required the sanction oE theDandaldkand EnnisheiUen shareholders to complete the agreement between. the two companies.
			The motion was seconded by Mr. GARTLAYD, and alter some explanations, was carried unimously,
			The meeting then2 separted.

			THE STEAM TRANSPORT AfELBOUR2IB.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-MIy attention has been directed to a letter in your impression of this date, referring to the screw steamer MIelbourne, chartered by Government as an hospital ship for the Chinese expedition.
			Asthat letter contains a number of isis-statements, I trust to your well4kmown impartiality to give insertion to this reply. So far from her not having been properly in- spected, both in hull sand machinery, before she started on her voyage, I beg to state that she ,as thoroughly over- hauled itevery rospect under th immediate supervision of thoe surveyors of the Board of Trad, and by the Admiralty authorities at Deptford.
			Yourncorrespondent insinuates that theo mchinery was at starting in so deectiv condition that she had hardly reached the Nore before It was discovered she was in en in- esaworthy condition; but that en attempt was tmade dur- ingthe course of a week to enable her to proceed boer voya,e. The real facts are that a defect in the airpump rod was discovered, but of so trilIng a nature that Messrs. rennie and Sons, the engincers, were enacbled to repairit in about 18 hours, and the ship proceeded on her voyage in the moat perfect state of efficiency, as is clearly proved by her having made the rnn to St. Vinhcnt in 14 days against headwinds, end the fearfnl gales which prevaled during the month of January last.
			In the extract ot the letter from one of thel eitary officers on board, furnished by your corr.epondent, ho states, under date of the 17th of Febrdary (12 days after leaving St. Vincent), that a stoppage occurred, "aEter which it gradually dawned upon us how thankful we should be that bursting boilers had not yet blown us into oter-
			ido not 'wish to impute deliberate malice to this gentle- man, whoever be may be, but I can hardly be wrong in ex- pressing the wish that he had boen moro aesurate in gascer
			taining the cause of the stoppage which occnrred before writimg in this strai. Thu truth is that the steppage was
			in no wayudependent on the boilers, which are in perfect order, but was aused by theo giving way of the intermediate crank shaft,-an accident that was solely occasioned by the stress of weatherathe shiphad previously undergone. Thu telbourne being within three days' sail of Rio Janeiro, it was considered more prudent by the Admiralty agent on beard to bear up for that port, where the crank shaft wuas repaired, and in the course of a few days she proceeded on her voyage under steam.
			This plain statement of fsts owill enable your readers to form their own judmlent upon the conclusion of your cone- spondent's letter, where he says, "aif the lives of our troops are to bc imperilled in such ships as the Melbourne, and if we are to touch at the Brazils cn route to Singapore, our education has scarcely been completed."
			As broker of the ship, in which capacity I consider it to he my duty to address yen, I affirm that the antecedents of the Melbourne in the Government service have been highly favourable. During the whole of the Crimean war shJ per- formed her work most efficiently, and for the past twoyears,
			aulgwlhpriod she has been almost constantly em- ployed by the Admiralty as a troopship, her various char- ters have been carried out without the slightest mishap or delay, and I am warranted in stating in a manner which has elicited the highest approval of the Board of A dmiralty.
			I do not wish to conceal that en accident has oscurred to the machinery of the Melbourne which neceessitated her touching at the Brazils en route to Singapore; but 1 do say that it is most unfair to impute ineffiCiency to the ship, and almost criminal negligence on the part of the autho- rities, because of en accident which is known to bo of fre- quent occurrence even to perfeetly new steamships, and which no human foresight could have prevented.
			I remain. Sir. your obedient servant.

			GxOLoGE' AsooiroN-The committee of this associatlon, having determinedaupon conducting a serles of excursions to different places of geological interest, a largo numaber of the members availed themselves on Moncday last of the facilittes afforded by the South-Eastern Rallway Com. pany to vislt Folkestone, with a view to examine the strata of this particularly interesting part of tho coast. The party was under the gaidanco of the president, tho Rev. Thomas Wiltshire, Professor Tennant,and others. They spent seve- ral hours on the shore investigating the chalk, greensands and gault, and procured a considerable number of the cha. racteristic fossils. In this manner the peculiarities of the above named formations were practically brought before the student, affording him a more correct idea of the rocks and their contents than ho could gain by the perusal of a library of geological works.
			THB ElwBLETox MuRDB.-The mystery which for some time shrouded the horrible murder committed at Embleton a fortnight ago bas now bsen dispelled by the confession of George Cam, Mr. Fearon's husbandman, that he was guilty of the foul crime. Susplcion pointed to Cass from the first, as, according to his own account7 confirmed in some of its materlt points by other wItnesses, he was about the house near tho very timo when the murder vas committed. SD far, however, the case vas only one of suspicion, there being no positive evidence to implicate hbm, for although the clothes which he wore on the day in question had been sent to Pro- fessor Taylor in order that certain suspicious looking spots might be anaylzed this point had not yeb been concluded. Cass Was therefore Lept under the most strict survellane, day and night, until last Frlday, when Mr. Dunne, the chief constable, deemed it his duty to direct his appre- henslon. As soon as it became Imown that Cass was to be apprehended the greatest excitement was manifested at Cockermouth and the neighbourhood. Mr. Dunne left Cockermouth, accompanied by some of his officers, at an early hour, and many persons had then gathered on the road to Embleton in order to see Casm as be was taken to the station. Cass was apprehended and brought to Cocker- mouth in a closeconveyance. Crowd3 of people had by this time gathered along the route, and an occasional boot as the carriage passed showed how great was the sympathy for tho girl, and the detestation in which the peopeI held the horrible crime which had been perpetrated. The pri- soner was lodged in the lock-up. At about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening ho expressed a desire to see
			the chief constable. Mr. Duane went to him, wvhen
			Cas told him that he wished to make a statement abont the murder. Mlr. Dunne sent immediately for Mr. Waugh, tho magistrates' clerk, and his assisL-int clerk and in thepresence of these three gentlemen, Cass confessed that he had mur- dered Ann SewelL E[e sad that when he returned from tho field for his mare, the glrl asked him something about mend- ing her clog for her. He would not complywith her request ; she therefore called him names and threw the tableknife at him,tbehandle of which struck him on the face, under theeye. He threw it back at her and it struck her throat and cut it. She then told him that since he had gone so far he had better fintsh it and murder ber altogether. He seized the knife again, and setting npon her committed the foul deed with which he now stands charged. It siso appears from tho prisoner's confession, that after he had murdered the girl ho robbed her. A sovereign and s half-crown have been found along with the girl's pmuse, the two latter bearing marks like blood stains. The balf-crown was obtained from hIrs. Johnston, the landlady at the pubaero.se at Eag]esfield whereLt e prisoner and his father spent a shilling of it on the Wednesday anfter the murder. The sovereign was found in the possession of the pri-oner's mother; and the purse wns discovered bmried 12 inches belowr the ground at SosgtU, Bramley Moss, near I,owe's Water. From this it would seem that the murderer had rifled the box of his victim while his hands were still wret with her blood. On Saturday the prisoner was brought up before the Cocennrouth magla. trates:-General Sir II. Wyndham, Mr. T. A. foskins, the P.ev. E. Fawcett, and Mr. John Steel, h-P'. Mr. Donna formally charged the prisoner with wilful murder, and zpplied for a remand. The prisoner was remanded until Thursday, by which ti.no the coroner's inquest will probably be dosed.

			LOIVDO.LV, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1860,
			At the Mansion-house dinner on Monday the Duke of CA.x3TRIDGE made some very true remarks, with his usual energy of expression, on the pecu- liarities of the British Army. There is no esta- blishment, no service, so unique; and it is hard to say whether foreigners or people at home are more mistaken as to its true character. At the very opening of the matter lies tbe strange paradox, touched on by the Duke, that we are not pre- eminently a military nation. It is true in a sense, but the moment one begins to reflect one sees that it can only be in a sense, and that not a real, or important, sense. In the first place, our Army is the only one of any 8ize consisting wholly of volunteers in the world. Other nations may have pet services, regiments recruited by volunteers from the rest of the army, or mere guards of honour. But in our I Army, as well as our Navy, every man is a volun.
			teer, and there is not one who has not enlisted from preference, from a sense of fitness, or otber reason of his own. This army, the freeest in the world, does also much more work, for its numbers, than any other army in the world ; is in the face of more foes, encounters more risks, aud has more actual experienice of war, than any other army. It is spread through either hemisphere and in every zone ; it fringes e%very continent and is scattered through a hundred isles; it is always on the ocean ; it is ever traversing some of the greatest rivers in the world; its hosts ascend some of the most famous mountain ranges. Though the entire British army could be reviewed in the Champ de Mars, yet, like a drop of some brilliant and powerful dye ia a large vase of water, it largely contributes to the aspect of all human affairs. Every- where in a few days' sail you may reach the British flag; everywhere its protection is within a month's call, and in a fewmonths moreits substantial succour, or overwhelming vengeance, may be obtained. The British sentry confronts tribes of savages and civil- ized empires. Thriftily meted out, as its efficacy permits and its paucity requires, it is here a solitary post, there a garrison of 5,000 men. Its want of numbers is supplied by perpetual motion. S9are loco nescit. It is here, there, and everywhere. As it cannot be always at hand, it must ever be in reach, and by double diligence make one man do the work of two. Taking in the mass, and con- sidering the service done, ours presents the largest front, and does most work, of all the armies that are now, or ever were. The Austrian army has not a soldier out of Europe; France is choked with her own army at home, but has no other work for it except the defence of her unprofitable position in Algeria and one or two smaU colonies. She is obliged to make work for her men at the expense of her neighbours. The British volunteer Army and Navy encircles the globe. It is only by turning a terrestrial globe round and round and up and down that one can fully realize the extent of its position and the vast- ness of its ordinary work.
			This peculiarity is brought home to our very eyes by the difference between the aspect of this metropolis and almost every other. Paris looks half inhabited by soldiers. Zouaves and other soldiers lounge about the great thoroughfares, and cluster like swarms of bees before the entrances of the barracks and other public buildings. They are everywhere, strolling through the gardens, sitting in the caf6s, half filling the omnibuses, attending the spectaclcs, looking up from cellars or down from attics, marching to and fro, and morn, noon, and night beating the incessant drum. For al they show themselves so much, you are always told in a whisper that there are two thousand here, or four thousand there, in some building, which either looks like a barrack, or, as often, like a public office or an asylum. As it is at Paris, so is it at all the large towns of France, besides some considerable camps here and there. It is this that gives the military look to the nation, and no doubt has its effect in ex- citing that military enthusiasm which renders France so lively an element in European affairs. But, unless the subjection of France itself is to be considered the work of this army, it is singularly destitute of regular employmernt. It is a vast engine with nothing to do. The Pyramid of CHEOPa to enshrine one mummy, the Palace of Versailles without a tenant, and one of our own three-deckers built to rot in harbour, are the only parallels of the French Army, unless it can be so fortunate as to pick a quarrel with a neighbour. Such is the appearance, such the 'work, of the grandest of French institutions, and that which in Paris equals the splendour of its shops and the gaiety of its entertainments. We would put it to any Englishman visiting Paris for the first time whether the Army is not the most prominent feature. At home it is as remarkably the opposite of this. We may safely say that the greater part of our three million fellow-citi- zens, unable as they are to go far from their work, seldom see one individual redcoat from one year's end to another; nay, may easily live 10 years without seeing as many soldiers together. There are sentinels at about a dozen palaces, exhi- bitions, and other publi buildings; and so rare are they that they are themselves part of the show. At certain hours of the day the ceremony of re- lieving guard is watched with as much interest as a sham fight. There are some barracks, with yards or parade grounds, where soldiers in undress may be seen at drill. The West-enders, if they are much in the streets, may occasionaDy see half a regiment on the march, or a troop going with a large band to escort HIzL MIAJEsTY to a Levee at St. James's. Perhaps the military event of the day is the per- formance of the band in the Colour-court at that Palace; and once a-year something of the pomp and majesty of glorious war may be seen on the Parade behind the Horse Guards:
			but, as it is not everybody who can fre- quent the exlibitions, sally out early to hear bands, be always in the streets, or confine himself to the chief thoroughfares of the WVest-end, so it is not one in ten of the whole population that can be said to witness the demonstrations we have described, and 'without them London is as unmartial a city as Mr. CODEDY or Mr. BRIcGT himnself could Dossibly desire. This is quite as true of al the provincial cities and towns, in England, at least. One may travel across the island and never see a soldier. In most places he is as great a novelty as a Hindoo in co3- tumo, or any imaginable exotic. Yet this Army, which is not seen, which presents nowhere the least idea of force, or even of substance and com- bination, is part of the strong anatomy and hard substance of the British community. It imparts confidence, it inspires respect, it sur- rounds the institutions, it adorns the Throne, it kindles patriotism, and, slight and scattered though it be, it is the depi t for the supply of innu- merable stations through 50 dependencies, including fortresses wrested from jealous States, and empires won from warlike and still insurgent populations. There nover was an army, not even that of the Roman Empire, which had to guard so vast a territory, which had to undertake so many difficult tasks, to cope with such perils, and which, after all, was so purely a volunteer force as ours.
			Such being the true character and position of the British Army, the Duke of CAaBIIDGE urges the necessity of keeping it in the highest state of efficiency that our resources will allow. We can never pretend to be so much at peace with all the world but what surprise may be near from some quarter or other; and the place we have assumed among nations does not permit to us the undignified and extravagant course of recover- ing from repose, and preparing in a hurry. The lessons of the last 20 or 30 years, fertile in panics, all tell in favour of a high state of efficiency. W e have to eke out the comparative paucity of our numbers with all those aids which the progress of art requires, and which our wealth happily places in our power. A British soldier is precious. He has come forward of his own accord to risk his life in the service of his country. For this he has re- jected good opportunities, and renounced domestic comfort, for the present at least. He must be well paid and kept. lVhen fully trained, he may be considered a most costly possession. Such a man, not easily replaced, and having to do the duty of several men, should have every aid that art and material can give him. He deserves the best
			weapons, and with such a man it pays to have them at almost any price. A regiment of such men are worth many batteries of Arm- strong or Whitworth guns, and a whole arsenal of rifles. They are worth highly educated officers, well prepared for the service, and supplied with every inducement to devote themselves to it. We expect much from such men; we depend upon them; we go out like the warriors of sacred or classic story, with few against many. Perhaps we do not safficiently take into account the inevitable waste of war, and the many causes which may tell against these few, and reduce the odds, already so much against us, to a still more terrible disparity. Late events have reminded us that we have no con- scription to fall back upon, no reserve except what we may obtain by a new appeal to voluntary patriotism. WVe have now the Militia and Volunteer Rifles for such an emergency, the whole of theni not equal to the reserve or new conscription which any foreign Minister can call up by the stroke of a pen. Of these the Volunteers are men with a place and duties at home. Such men are not mere food for powder. They are not men to be marched on to fill a ditch with their dead bodies, or to take off the first edge of the enemy's sabres. We have no soldiers of this quality. Ours are aU picked miien, and we must make the best of them. So we must prepare ourselves for ample army estimates for many years to come, as long, at least, as we are the nation we have been, possess our present Army, and find it so widely extended and with so many foes, far and near, ready to occupy the ground from which it once recedes.

			Far be it from us to hail with pleasure any attack on the liberty of the press in a foreign country. WVith the system of warnings and sus- pensions we have no sympathy, nor can we look upon a State prosecution like that of M. DE Mo.NTA- LE3MERT as anything but a stretch of power. But it is certainly within the right of a Govern- ment to give an official contradiction to false news or mischievous insinuations, and consequently we may permit ourselves to congratulate the Emperor of the FRENCH, for his own sake if not for our own, on the rebuke he has administered to the Pays and the Patrie. These papers have for some days been engaged in spreading the absurd report that the insurrections which have simul- taneously, but with very different objects, broken out in Spain and Sicily have been fomented by English agents, and that they are, in fact, the work of the English Cabinet, which desires to em- barrass the victorious ISABEL and the patriotic FRANCis by rousing legitimacy against the one and revolution against the other. iMany persons will be surprised that we should attach the smallest importance to theso efforts of a miserable envy. They will say that as long as they can remember not a month has passed without England being charged by the Continental press with delinquencies just as absurd as this Carlist rising, and that this country has always been con- tent to let the slander fall to the ground with its own weakness. The spite of a Parisian journal they may think is no more to be taken up seriously than the assertions of a publichouse orator that the British Cabinet is in league with Russia, and receives regular remittances of imperials from St. Peters- burg. This estimate is, however, hardly correct. The English public, accustomed to the light of publicity and discussion, can hardly realizo the ignorance and credulity of the Continent. It is only from occasionally meeting and talking with a Frenchman or German or Italian that we can learn what even educated men are willing to believe about us. The selling of wives in Smith- field has hardly ceased to be a stock inci- dent of dramas the scene of which is laid in England, and politically we are sup- posed to be tormenting the Irishman, the Ionian, and the Hindoo, with the one object of deluging them with manufactures. That prints like the Pays and the Patrie, whiclh on other sub- jects are sane enough, should publish such ravings as have appeared within the last few days is not a matter of surprise when we consider that the great majority of their readers are as ill-informed as themselves on the subject of England.
			As regards the King of NAPLES and his revolted subjects in Sicily the opinions of Englishmen are weU known. We do not intend to interfere in the quarrel, and we certainly have not promoted it; but if ever the Sicilians were to get the better of the Royal troops and establish their independence no one among us would break his heart. It is very different with Spain. The public of this country have always been favourable to the cause of Queen ISAnELLA, which has been, on the whole, the cause of liberty. Though HER MAJESTy'S Government may not have proved aU that was desired, yet the difference between Spain with even such a constitution as now exists and Spain such as Don C.ARLOS and his priests would have made her is infinite. Oar critics on theother side of the Channel would find it difficult to point out a single act of the British Government which has shown a wish to disturb the QUEEN in the possession of her throne. In spite of many provocations, and a generaly unfriendly de- meanour, arising from no other cause than that dislike which ill-conditioned minds feel towards those from whom they have received benefits, the British Government has never wavered in its support of the present settlement in Spain, and of ISABELLA'S rights in the few dependencies which remain to the Spanish CRowN. The Consti- tutional Government in the mother country and its authority over Cuba have always had the warmest sympathy of this country; and, should a priestridden faction overthrow liberty at home and lose the richest colony in the world, the fault will be none of ours. The French press has always accused us of a selfish policy, and it may be admitted that in defending the Spanish CrowvN 50 years ago we had in view partly our own safety. This same policy bids us still labour for the independence and greatness of Spain. Although we may discourage such enter- prises as the war in Morocco, yet the peace and prosperity of the Peninsula are to us, perhaps, the most important Continental question.
			These considerations, however, though evident enough, seem never to occur to the prejudiced minds of our French contemporaries. 'he Continent at this time is, perhaps, more disposed to do jus- tice to England than has been usuaUy the case. The wise, moderate, and statesmanlike course adopted by the Government in recent transactions has not failed of its effect. England stands before the world as the friend of peace, and the friend of liberty and self-government. But there is enough of the old leaven remaining to give the insinua- tions of the Pays and Patrie some currency; and we may accordingly express our satisfaction that the French EMPEROR should have reproved the promoters of these false reports. No one better knows than the Emperor NAPOLEON the spirit and the aims of our present policy, and he cannot but recognize the fact, that if we oppose some of his designs while assisting him in the execution of others, our conduct in both cases is regulated by a wish to see the Continent enjoy that repose which is essential to its prosperity, and for which it so much longs.

			At every production of the Navy Estimates we are reminded that " steam is in its infancy," and i the fact is impressed upon us by a very disa2ree-
			able process. WVe are Compelled to provide enor- mous sums for the nurture and sustenance of our steam force without ever arriving at the happy period of economy and relief. In fact, to judge from the last ten years' experience, the expense will be perpetual,-that is to say, we shall never find a steam marine as cheap as the old sailing navy. It is not merely that the work of construction or conversion is constantly going on. That process would come to an end in comuse of time, thongh it has been truly a tedious one; but the truth is, that even when the British Navy has attained the standard of expansion delineated by Sir Joax PAxrGTroiN a short time ago, it will still cost a far greater SUmU for its maintenance than would have been needed in years gone by. The elements of cost, indeed, appear in every direction. Mhat with the in- creased size of our vessels and the value of the machinery which they contain, the original charge of a ship is often more than doubled. A 50-gun frigate of the modern build costs four times as much as a vessel of that rate in NELsoN's time. Then comes the con- sumption of fuel-an enormous item; then the wages of the engineers, and the wear and tear of engines; and last, though not least, the rapid dilapidation of the whole fabric under the new system of propulsion. NVe have touched upon this topic once or twice before, but the subject is so important that we commend it afresh to public consideration, especially as a recent event w-il place it in rather a striking light.
			Last week five stout steamships of the Channel squadron anchored at Spithead on their return from Lisbon. They had encountered boisterous weather, no doubt, but we certainly were not prepared for the report that they had all suffered such damage as to require considerable repairs before they could again proceed to sea. From the description given of their condition it appears evident that they suffered not merely as ships, but as steamships. Had they been sailing vessels of the old character they might have beon longer on the voyage and less efficient maen-of-war, but they would probably not have received such injury as to send them into dock. NEmsox used to talk triumphantly of the manner in which his ships could buffet the gales of the Mediterranean without carrying away a spar; but NELSOx's vessels had no steam-pipes to be carried away, no funnel-casings to be torn, and no condensers to be cracked. WVe suspect, too, that they would have rolled far less heavily and with slighter strain, while the current outlay upon each would have been much less considerable.
			We expressly call attention to this example because it illustrates the chief point of our present difficulties. When the great dockyard mystery was investigated last year, it came out that the principal expenditure in our national establishments was upon repairs. The construction of new ships was quite a secondary concern, and was, in fact, provided for out of the surplus or margin left by the charges of renewing and refitting. That was the way the money went, and these formidable charges are enormously increased by a system of propulsion which is not only costly in itself, but which shakes the ships to pieces besides. Indeed, we seem to be getting from worse to worse, for the vibration of the screw is said to be more destruc- tive than that of the paddle. WVe are therefore incessantly at work in repairing damages, and a few days at sea in heavy weather is enough to send back our stoutest vessels with fresh demands upon the resources of our yards.
			Let the reader just consider how terribly these accumulated conditions must tell upon the current charge of the lNavy. A ship in these days costs much more to build, much more to keep going, and lasts, probably, not half as long after all. Un- luckily, we hardly know the worst in this latter respect, for our steam marine is still too young to have shown its average of casualties ; but it is only too evident that such wear and tear as we have described must soon terminate a vessel's career. This is an answer to those who institute numerical comparisons between our naval force at the present day and that of S15. The money spent on the Mersey steam frigate would have built three old-fashioned 74's. The cost of such a fleet as we possessed at the close of the Revolutionary Wars would, if raised to the modern standard of charge, be ahnost beyond computation. We possess, in reality, a fleet which is infinitely stronger than the fleets of former days, though its power, as regards ships of the line, is concentrated in a much smlaler number of vessels. The finest squadron ever taken to sea by Co=c- WOOD or JERvYis would have been blown out of the water by the five ships which were so damaged in a voyage from Lisbon.
			AR this outlay, in short, is forced upon us by a single condition of the first necessity. The great object in a ship of war is, as the Secretary of the American Navy defined it, to place a gun in pre- sence of an adversary, and withdraw it, in the shortest possible space of time. There is the principle wlich governs the whole system. For the sake of this object we fabricate machinery, con- some fuel, and shape the hulls of our vessels on the newest and most approved models. A ship which can steam 15 knots an hour will infallibly be more than a match for one that can steam only 12 ; in fact, the slower vessel would lie utterly at the mercy of its more quickly- moving adversary. Even here, however, the pros- pect is somewhat uncertain, for no vessel can always rely on her steam power. The most roomy and commodious specimens will only carry fuel enough for 10 or 12 days' consumption, so that on a long cruise, or in a protracted blockade, ships must resort again to their sails, reserving their steam for critical periods. And what, under such circum- stances, would be the plight of our modern vessels, with their heavy armaments and ponderous ma- chinery ? Would they be able to brave storm after storm like the lighter and more buoyant craft of fifty years since ?
			The inquiries thus suggested are, perhaps, not very agreeable. It is unpleasant to reflect that we have embarked upon a system which is costly in the extreme, which will probably never get much cheaper, and which yet, in some respects, may prove less convenient than that which it super- seded. But there is no help for it. A sailing vessel could not keep the sea against a steamer for half an hour, and it must always be recollected that what is a burden upon us is a burden upon other Powers also. In the end it comes to this- that war, including the preparations against it, will be a more costly business than formerly, and perhaps, therefore, will work out its own cure. When the Secretary of the Admiralty told the House the other day that a naval captain of his acquaintance was perfectly astounded at the cost of his ship for a single year, he gave the key to the annual charges of the Navy. There was the unit of cost. A ship is incredibly expensive, and yet is always getting out of repair. Something, we firmly believe, is to be saved by better principles of management; but we shall never altogether escape the large expenditure and inevitable waste which steam power involves.

			A Bill to Amend the Procedure and Powers of the Court for Divorce and MIatrimonial Causes has been introduced into the House of Peers by the LooD CHNCELLOR. It is exceedingly short, con- taining but six sections. By the first authority is given to the Judge-Ordinary to exercise powers
			now vested in the Full Court, at the same time that he is to have the option of calling in the assistance of one of the other Judges, at his oun discretion. By the second section the Judge- Ordinary may direct any matter to be heard by the Full Court; -while, on the other band, either party, if dissatisfied with his decision upon the question of granting or refusing a new trial, may appeal to the Full Court. and their de- cision is final. It is provided in the third section that where, as at present, there is a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the decision of the Full Court there shall be a like right with regard to the decisions of the Judge-Ordinary, sitting with or without a coadjutor, and acting under Lord CA3o,xra.'s new Act. The fourth section is unim- portant for our present purpose, as it is merely directed to a better regulation of the times of sitting of the Full Court; but to the fifth we would cal more particular attention. Here it is iin cfxteso, for it is short enough to admit of precise cjuota- tion :-" Where only one of the parties to any "matter before the Court shall appear it shall be "lawful for the Court, if it shall see fit, to order "Hsa BMAjsTY's Proctor to instruct counsel to "argue before the Court any question in relation to "such matter, and which the Court may deem it "necessary or expedient to have fully argued." This is, in its entirety, the section upon which we are about to offer a few remarks. We will, in order to exhaust the contents of the Bill, simply record the fact that the sixth section extends the powers
			of the Court with reference to settlements of a wife's property -when she has been divorced on the ground of adultery. The powers given by the formerAct (20th and 21st of VicronRA, cap. 85, sec. 45) were already very large, and constituted, per- haps, the most remarlkable example existing in our system of English law of the unsettlement and resettlement by public authority of settlements solemnly made between private parties. The LORD Cn.A^cELro now proposes to add fresh vigour to these powers, transcendant as they already were; and the section, no doubt, re- quires careful consideration and discussion. For the moment, however, we confine our attention to the provisions of the fifth section, quoted above, which refer to a smaller although a very important matter.
			It is obvious enough to any one who has attended the sittings of the Divorce Court that one of the great difficulties-perhaps the greatest diffi- culty-with which the Judges have to deal in administering the new law is collusion between the parties. Nor must it be supposed that this difficulty is greater under the new than under the old law; nothing is changed except the scene of the struggle, and the greater number of the collusive applications. In the old days judgment in a crim. con. case was allowed to go by default in the Common Law Court, and when the parties were confronted in the Sheriftfs Court for the assessment of damages the leading counsel for the husband was interrupted by the leading counsel for the adulterer after he had pronounced a few fiery sentences. The learned gentlemen put their heads together for a f;ew seconds, apparently in earnest consultation, and it was then announced to the Court that the parties had come to an agree- ment for damages at "so-aud-so." The scandals were not ripped up, and so the first act of the judicial farce was brought to a conclu- sion. Before the Ecclesiastical Court the marriea pair simply joined issue upon the question of a divorce a nwnsd et thoro, and if the husband had the discretion to leave the matter in the hands of his legal advisers, and all points of recri- mination or palliation were silenced on the wife's side, there was no great difficulty about getting a decree there. It was not until the case was brought before the House of Lords that there was any real opportunity for examining into the probabilities of coUusion. As many of our readers as ever gave any attention to this unsavoury subject must well remember the reports of such cases before this high tribunal -with which it was our most disagreeable duty to furnish them when the season of the year for the discussion of divorces came round. Some- times the collusion was cletected, more frequently not. So it has been, and so it ever wiU be, wherever the suippressio veri-a sharper and more efficient weapon even than the suggestio falsi-is placed in the hands of unscrupulous suitors. The old Law Lords were keen enough in the matter, and they had their own experience at their baclks as to what they had done themselves when they were counsel iu similar cases ; but still it can scarcely be said that they succeeded in exposing more than a small percentage of the fictions which were presented to their notice. On tho whole,
			it seems probable that the machinery of a single Judge, who gives the whole powers of his mind and his exclusive attention to the considera- tion of such matters, is more ik-ely to prove efrec- tual than that of a tribunal where the attendance of the Judges was voluntary, and where they could give none but the most passing and perfunctory attention to this particular class of litigation. There is, unhappily, no doubt that collusion exists in many undefended cases, and the parties are notoriously not very scrupulous as to the meaus they employ to rid themselves of the intolerable burden of each other's presence. The law of the land, however, is that an absolute dissolution of the marriage bond shall only be granted on certain conditions, and as the penalty for certain well-defined acts. With this end in view powers are given, as wehave seen,by LordCO,A.irnE's new Bill to the Judge-Ordiuary, who in undefended cases may require the QuEa's Proctor to instruct counsel to argue any points which the Court may think worthy of fuller examination. Tho counsel so appointed is pro temp)orc a public servant-he appears for the nation, to take care that the law in matrimonial matters, as settled for the public advantage, is not infringed. In order to avoid the expense of permanent maehinery for occasional objects, and not to call it into play upon insufficient occasions merely to justify its own existence, discretion is left with the Judge- Ordinary as to whether counsel shall be called upon so to act at all. All this seems to be fair and reasonable enough, but a question has arisen as to what shall be the machinery which the Judge- Ordinary is to put in motion whenever in his opinion a case has arisen which requires that the Court shall take unusual precautions against fraud and collusion.
			The CmsscErLou's new Bill points out the QUEES'S Proctor as the officer who is first to be set in motion by the Court, and, as far as the public are concerned, the selection seems reasonable enough. Such an officer exists; he discharge3 under the Probate branch of Sir CRanSWELLT C1xsswL's jurisdiction like duties in certain matters connected with intestate estates; he was familiar with the business of the Court under the old system of Divorce; he has ha2 abundant opportunities of following it up under the new. At the same time, he is not over- whelmed with occupations of the most distractina and various kinds, like the Attorney-General, for example. The Attorney-General cannot give even the most transitory personal attention to a very large proportion of the business which is thrown upon his shoulders. The counter-proposition, how- ever, to that of the LORD CHMANCLLLOR is that the words " the QUEEN'S Proctor" shall be struck out of Lord CAINPnBEta's Bill, and the words "the At- "torney-General" be substituted in their place.
			If it be objected that tbe Attorney-General is already overworked, the reply is, that though he cannot at- tend to the matter himself, he can do it by deputy. We may remuarkt, however, that the public will Iderive no particular advantage from the fact that the Attorney-General is put in possession ~of a little extra patronage, to be distributed among his subordinates. On the other hand, in the QUErN-'s Advocate-who, we may further remark, takes precedence of the Attorney-General, and whom the Q-uzzN's Proctor would naturaUy instruct-we have an officer who would certainly be able to devote a teasonable portion of his time and attention to the matter. All things considered, then, and as the choice would seem to He between the Attorney-General's subordinates and the head of a branch of the profession especially devoted to such business, we are bound to say that Lord CAMIPFELL seems to have arrived at a very wise decision, after having given the matter due consideration, and, no doubt, after having taken the best opinions on the subject that he could procure.

			SPAIN AND AIOROCCO. i
			(Fzpolf OUR SPECIA.L CORn1-.nr*'T-)
			SPAN-SH CAMP, N-EAR TETUAIN,
			MAncH 29.
			The action of the 23d inst. had for one of its most remarkable features the desperate valour exhibited by the DMoors, which at least once during the fight eeemed not unlikely effectually to counter- balance the superiority the Spaniards owe to dis- cipline and artillery. They have often fought viell before, but it was hardly to be expected, under all the circumstances, that they should have fought best at the last. When we remember that theyhad been invariably defeated during this four months' campaign-often, as I believe, with less damage than their careful, deliberate fire inflicted on the victors, but on some other occasions,certainly,vwithveryheavy loss-that they had not a single triumph to look back upon as a precedent for hope, nor a single gan to oppose to the Spanish artillery, which, wsith that prodigality of fire that distinguishes it,crushed them with shot, shell, and rockets; remembering aU these things, I say, one must regard with admiration the fact that on Friday last they showed a dash and determination even greater than they ever before displayed. They came down upon the Spaniards and fought with them hand to hand, and more than once, especially in the village on the left, in and around which some of the hardest fighting of the day took place, drove them back by the weight and accuracy of their fire. In the afternoon, when their beat positions had been taken, anid they felt themselves losing ground, their resistance grew feebler ; but in the morning it was of a very formidable character, and I have reason to believe that at one time Prim, who did the lion's share of the fighting, was rather un- easy at the aspect of affairs. More than once, as I mentioned in my last letter, it was only by throw- ing himself into the thick of the danger and inspirit- iag his men by his voice and example that he averted disasters that might have been serious. The Spaniards, while extolling the valour of their enemies, would naturaUy bave it to be inferred that their own has been on all occasions superior; but they cannot deny that in this last action, as in that of CastiUlejos, the Moors pressed them hard, and
			even compelled portions of their force to recede. Prim's moral influence with the troops is great, and he was fortunate in having about him several very cool and determined officers. The skill displayed in the plan and conduct of the battle is considered, by competent judges, not to have been extraordinary. Few battles are fought, however, in which some mistalkes are not made, and of course the blunders leave the more credit to the soldiers and regimental officers who triumph in spite of them. The cavalry was, as usual in all this war, indifferently handled, and sacrificed without corresponding advantage. A squadron of Borbon lost about half its numbers by being placed in a position where it could not act efficiently, and where it was ex- posed to a heavy fire. Under such circum- stances the bravery of the men avails little. Another squadron was so unlucky, when charging, as to ride over a portion of the Catalan volunteers, some 30 or 40 of whom theystretched, sorely bruised, upon the ground. The artillery fired an immense deal, and repeatedly covered and repaired short- comings. One six-gun battery distributed no less than 400 projectiles, and I have no reason to believe that it was more generous than its neighbours. The Spaniards, who are morbidly sensitive to foreign criticism, are sharpsighted and acute critics of themselves. Among various Nvitty epigrams and doggrels that have had currency in camp during the war is one which says that in this campaign the artilery has been the " indispensable," and the cavalry "the victim." Nothing could be truer. I am far from depreciating the many excellent qualities of the Spanish infantry, which 1 have repeatedly set forth and extoUled; but it is unquestionable that on various occasion3 in this war it would have gone hard with it but for the support and protection of the artiUery.
			In the action of the 23d the Moors showed more previous plan and concert than had previously been usual with them. They were seen moving steadily up from different directions, and taking up deter- mined positions. Not content with holding these, they advanced upon the Spaniards with unflinching boldness, and early in the day they were mixed up and fighting at close quarters with the infantry of Echague's corps. There were many instances of extraordinary intrepidity, and even of desperate throwing away of life, in the course of the contest. I think I have already mentioned an attack made by a handful of M4oors on a whole battalion, withi wvhich four or five of them were bayoneted. In one of the villages, the possession of which was so sharply contested, a horrible conflict took place. The rush and cane-built hovels were blazing, and Spaniards and Moors fought amongst them, struggling to throw each other into the flames. One young Ensign, after using his revolver, was seized by an athletic Moor and tossed into the midst of a burning hut. His men rescued him, grievously burnt and nearly suffocated by the smoke. The Moors, -when their ammunition was expended or their arms were broken, gathered stones from the ground and hurled them at their opponents. A foreign officer told me that he saw a tall, well-mounted Moor ride deliberately down, sabre in hand, upon 10 or 12 Spanish skir- mishers. Hecut at one of them, but the man made a movement, and his shako only was struck from his head. The Moor then seized him by the collar, dragged him a fewv paces, and tossed him to a couple of men on foot, vwho appeared from among some brushwood and forthwith cut off his head. A captain of cavalry, when riding alone to take an order, was attacked by a single Moor on foot, who, however,
			got the worst of the fight, for the officer killed him with his sabre. A great many of the Aloors were armed with English muskets and bayonets-old flint muskets, bearing the Tower mark.
			Although the temperature of the day on the 23d inst. was far inferior to that of the 25th, vwhich was here like a hot summer day in England, still the heat was considerable and the sun at one time oppressive, and the Spanish infantry deserve much credit for the manner in which they supported the fatigues of the action-fought chiefy over uneven and hilly ground-loaded as they wvere with their complete kit and with six days' rations. For patient endurance and cheerfulness under hard- ship of all kinds the Spanish soldier is not to be surpassed. I cannot go so far as some of his enthu- siastic countrymen, whom I have heard declare him to be the best in the world, nor do I think such ex- aggerated laudation shows much wisdom on the part of those who indulge in it; but that he has many sterling qualities, and is of the stuff of which first- ra'e soldiers are made, there can, I think, be no doubt whatever upon the mind of any impartial foreigner who has had opportunities of observing his behaviour throughout the very trying campaign now happily brought to a close.
			The whole of the army is now encamped on the ground it occupied before the 23d inst., with the exception of Ech.ue's corps and the 1st division of the reserve, which marched this morning for Ceuta. Headquarters occupy the old spot taken up on the 6th of February, after the occupation of Tetuan-a spot then so rural, and fresh, and p'Ic- turesque, but where the verdure has now been worn off the earth by much tramplng of men and horses, wvhile the pleasant shade of numerous trees has been sadly sacrificed to the necessities of camp cookery. Even the princely oak that formed the prime ornament and landmark of the elevated meadow has fallen a victim to the axe, and its very
			roots have been converted into a huge fireplace. I The orchards have suffered much. The breath of early spring has covered the upper branches of the figtrees with tender green, but from most of them, lopped anid barled aud mule-gnawed as they are, but little fruit can be expected. A considerable strip of orchard and shrubbery, to the right of the sea-front of Tetuan and very near the walls, has been devastated by fire. When the army moved forward on the 23d,-Ieaving in Tetuan and in' the forts near the sea garrisons so slender that that they would have been in danger had O'Donnell passed the Fondach,-the Moors, from the mointains on the right of the Guad-el-Jelu, came down and crossed the river, and infested the road between the shore and the town, firing upon the latter, especially at night, and showing great audacity. It was a remarkable change from the time when a single traveller might pass from Fort Martin to the city without the smallest risk of molestation. Already, for some days before the march of the army, small parties of marauders had begun to haunt that route, lurking on the further side of the river and firin- across sometimes ford-
			ing it to rob and murder a lonely muleteer or straggling soldier. The presence of a few cavalry pickets, however, sufficed to render such depredations rare, but the moment that the army marched for- ward the Moors appeared in greater numbers, and with increased boldness. Nearly the whole day of the 23d there was firing aU along the road, several persons were killed and wounded, property was abandoned by canteenmen and othera who fled for their lives, a cart and 10 mules were carried off by the Moors, and a squadron, dispersed in patrols, was more than once obliged to assemble and charge the enemy. On the 24th the same thing went on; the wounded from the previous day's battle could be taken down only under a strong escort, and when this returned, taking up ammunition and reinforced by two battalions that had just arrived from Malaga, it had to fight its way through. At night the Mlilitary Governor of Tetuan, and other officers who went the rounds, were fired upon from a very short distance as they passed along the battlements. So it was thought necessary to thin the luxuriant orchards that grow close up to the walls, and afforded cover to the Arab sharpshooters. It was a pity, but it could not be helped, and the flames crackled amvng the peacb, and almond, and fig trees. Fortunately, this deplorable destruction was soon checked, for next morning arrived the news of peace, brought by Colonel Sarabia, Chief of the Staff of the Basque Contingent, who was quickly followed by those hardy mountaineers and by the whole of Rios's division. Within the town, during the two days' absence of the army, the Moors had sbown great insolence and hardi- hood. A soldier was murdered in the street, and an officer, who imprudently paused for a moment in a lonely corner, was stabbed from behind. The wound was not severe, and he turned and fired two shots from his revolver at the assassin, who, nevertheless, escaped unhurt. The terms on which peace had been concluded were at first some- what misrepresented by public rumour. It was said thatTetuan was ceded in perpetuityto the Spaniards, and thejoy of the Jews was great at this, for there Is nothing they dread more than the return of the Moors, who are said to have uttered fearful threats as to what they would do to the Hebrew population when they should get back the city. The poor Israelites were soon undeceived, and their counte- nances fell. I presume they will have prayers put up in their synagogues for a long protraction of the Spanish occupation, and that the Morocco Govern- ment may never be able to raise the 4,000,0001. sterling it has pledged itself to pay in redemption of Tetuan.
			During the last three days we have been suffering from a visit of our old enemy, the Levant wind, which has so largely contributed to aggravate the many privations and miseries of this African cam- paign. The steamers had to leave the coast, and yesterday and the day before no post came in or went out. Last night there was a complete change, it is now blowieg half a gale from the west, a steamer is off shore. The mails were sent down early this morning, and we hope soon to receive the three that are here due.
			The following has been issued and printed in camp:
			GENERAL ORDER OF THrE 25TH MARCTr, 1S60, T TIaE
			C.Urr OF TIHE SIERRA OF BENISIDER.
			"Soldiers,-The campaign of Africa, which has so greatly raised the glory and the name of the Spanish army, has ter- minated to-day; the results of the battle of the 33d have shown the Moors that the struggle was no longer possible. They have begged for peace, accepting the conditions they previonsly refused. Muley-el-Abbas, Imperial Prince and Generalissimo, has come to our camp to sign its preliminary bases.
			" AU the difficulties opposed to us 'oy an inhospitable country, without roads, vithout population, without re- sources of any kind, during a most severe winter, and while the terrible scourge of cholera augmented our sufferings and thinned our ranks, have failed to vanquish your constancy, and have found yon ever contented and disposed to fulfil the noble miesion confided to you by your Queen and your country.
			" That mission is accomplished. Two battles and 23 combats, in which you have invariably conquered a nume- rous, valiant, and fanatical enemy, taking from him his artil. lery, tents, ammunition, and baggage, have revenged the ontrage offered to the Spanish flag.
			"The indemnity in territory and in money which the Moorish Government binds itself to give to us compensates the sacrifices made by our country to revenge the offence received.
			" Soldiers! I shaU always' remember with noble pride the traits of valour and heroism of which I have been wit- ness. Reckon at aU times on the sincere affection of your General in Chief.
			"LEOPOLD O'DOINNELLt.
			Thls must be admitted to be a very becoming proclamation, saying no more than the truth, and totally devoid of that tendency to exaggeration and bombast with which Spanish commanders have sometimes been reproached.
			It is said that after the action of the 23d a num- ber of the Moorish tribes departed to their homes, and that even some of the regular troops declared that they would fight no more, so that Muley Abbas had no choice but to accept the terms imposed. Since the sigoature of the treaty the MIoors have testified an earnest desire to fulfil it with good faith, and also to comply with its clauses as soon as possible, in order to recover possession of Tetuan. They have told some of the Spanish Staff that the money for the indemnity is aUl ready, and wil very shortly be paid-all in silver, so that it wiul require a prodigious number of mules to trausport it. I confess myself rather incredulous of this immediate solvency. Several hundred Moorish horsemen are now distributed in the plain on the right side of the river, to the south of this camp, their duty being to maintain order among the neighbouring tribes, which have shown themselves disposed, notwithstanding the peace, to help themselves to the mules and cattle of the Spaniards. The night before last a good many shots were fired into camp, somne of them very close at band, but the MIoorish troops have orders to treat all offenders summarily-i. e., to cut off their heads forthwith-so that better order is now likely to be maintained. The camp, too, has been in great measure cleared of the crowd of Moors, both black and vwhite, who swarmed to it on Monday and Tuesday, partly, it is probable, from curiosity, but also vith the view of sell- ing espingardas and other weapons, for which there is now a large demand among the Spaniards. It is considered a further proof of the haste the Moors are in to get rid of the invader by complying vwith the terms of the treaty, that they have already appointed agents to that end, and two of them left
			tave theretore instituted further inquiries, both of commanding officers of corps and of members of the medical staff, and the following is their result. The beef in tins should be used as soon as opened and not kept till the next day, for it becomes soon spoiled after being exposed to the atmosphere, by the exclusion of which it is preserved. Persons who are advocates of it's use when eaten at once admit that within 24 hours after being opened it undergoes a perceptible change, which doubtleas affects its wholesomeness. A good deal is said to depend also on the mode of cookery. A portion of its preparation, as I am informed, consists in com- pression, and this in great measure destroys the gelatinous portion of the meat and renders it unfib for conversion into soup and bouilli-the French pet-au-fet, the Spanish ptchero or cocido. An in- telligent and experienced medical man, who during this campaign has had abundant opportuni- ties of studying the subject, tells me that the best manner of preparing it is by frying, with a little oil or lard, but without any sauce or gravy. Thus cooked, with the addition of salt, which is deficient in the prirnary preparation, he is of opinion that it is wholesome food, and not easy to distinguish from fresh beef, except that it is a little stringy. The same authority observed to me that some persons conceive a repugnance to the tin-meat, and that with such it is likely enough to disagree, and this may account for the belief, which I know to have been prevalent at one time among a portion of the soldiers of this army, that it gave them diarrhoa. It is further to be remarked that one lot of the beef (a few hundred cases, I believe) turned out badly, owing to some defect in the preparation or unascertained cause, and was admitted by the contractors not to be the proper thing. When it is good the crevices in the solid meat should be full of jelly, in lieu of which, in the tins in question, there was a watery liquid, and the flavour was not wvhat it ought to have been. It is generally understood and admitted that these pre- served meats should not form the soldiers' daily food, but should be varied by other diet. Here the army have rung the changes upon preserved meats, fresh meats, and bacon-this last chiefly British, and of excellent quality. A very large part of the provisions of this army (both for men and horses) has been sinpplied by English houses, and I must in justice add that the Spaniards express themselves extremely satisfied with the manner in which they have been served. Indeed I was gravely assured, this very morning, by a Spanish brigadier (whom I suspect, however, to be secretly addicted to the enemy-that is to say, to the English) that the merits of streaky bacon and fragrant hay and crisp biscuit have gone some way towards diminish- ing the just indignation excited by the barbaric partialities of the British Government, and by the countenance, assistance, and direction afforded to the BMoors by " El Senor Dromenay"-as some of the papers print the name of EHer Britannic Majes- ty's Consul-General at Tangier.
			SPANISE CAMP, OUTSIDE TETUAN, Mimci 31.
			Picture to yourself a narrow tongue of high ground jutting out for some distance into the vaUey from the base of a bold round hill, just as from an aged dwarf oak, the earth at whose foot has been worn away by time, a sturdy limb of root stretches itself above the surface of the soil. The hill is mottled with gray stone and dark green herbage; the upper end of the ramification or buttress that springs from it is diversified by clumps of cactus, form- ing irregular hedges round fields that lately were orchards, and round vineyards that sadly need the dresser's care. Its lower or foremost end Is worn to the colour, although not to the smoothness, of an English high road on a dry day. At about 100 yards from its extremity, and just in front of a scanty screen formed by four or five dilapidated olive and fig trees, stands a marquee of moderate dimensions, surmounted by two smal flags of the Spanish colours, and flanked by a gray sentry- box. Rtight and left of this, the habitation of the Commander-in-Chief, stand the tents of the aides- de-camp, and, from tbese, tbere extends forward a double line of tents, forming a broad street, and occupied byhead-quarters' staff,and by the numerous
			omcers and a tew civlians attached thereto. Starting from the entrance of O'Donnell's tent you pass those of the chief of thestaff, of thecommanderof theescort, the governor of the camp, the Commandants-general of artiUery and engineers, the post-office, the medical staff, &amp;c., and you reach the extremity of the little plateau, where it dips suddenly and rather precipi- tously into the vaUey. From this point you have an extensive view in all directions. To your right rear stands the Alcazaba, with the cemetery below it, the large white tombs of the Moors looking at a short distance like a smaU town; between the fortress and the city wall is a round green tumulus, its fresh colour contrasting agreeably with the dazzling glare of Tetuan's houses. Truly that city is as the whitened sepul- chre of the Scriptures ; from without, seen in the sunlight, it is like snow or frosted silver ; enter it, and on every side your eyes and nostrils are offended by filth, squalor, and misery. At its southern side passes the river, through a narrow ravine between the city and the mountains, which thence stretch down to the sea and form the southern boundary of the valley. Downwards, from their barren summits, on some of which a little snow is still discernible, your gaze passes, gladly re- posing on the lower wood-clad slopes, until it reaches the smiling plain, with its green mea- dows and rich orchards, with every here and there a hamlet nestling among fruit trees, or the white countryhouse of some affluent Tetuanese. The course of the river is for the most part concealed by high banks and thick foliage, but occasionally in its windings the eye catches its bends, shining like silver plates. To your left front are the Spanish forts, Custom-house, and Martin, and then come the eea, the Spanish squadron, and a little fleet of transports. Quite upon your left the view is inter- cepted by a rising ground close at hand, upon which stand the tents of the 3d corps, but above this eleva- tion you catch a glimpse of a more distant and con- siderable one, surmounted by the old tower of Djeleli, so often referred to as forming the centre of the principal Aloorish camp when first the Spanish army entered the valley of Tetnan.
			It is 5 o'clock in the evening. A fierce westerly gale sweeps down the valley on the other side of Tetuan, over the town and through the camp, raising clouds
			this camp this morning, with General Echague, for Ceuta, to mark out the limits of the Spanish terri- tory around that place. The main line will be the bottom of the ravine that Intervenes between the redoubts and the Sierra Bullones.
			I have lately had my attention called to the subject of the beef preserved in tins, which has been largely used for rations by this army durino the late campaigns. I find that some of the Spanish superior officers do not agree with the remarks I made several weeks ago with reference to the suitableness of such food for soldiers in the field, remarks founded on personal knowledge and inquiry. They have not found that it was distasteful to the men under their command, or that it produced the tendency to diarrhoea which it was unquestionably considered to have done in the portion of the army with which I was at that time encamped, and in numerous individual cases that came under my observation. The subject is an im- portant one, not as regards this army, now about to return to Spain, but because the food in question is likely to be largely used by the armies of other nations, if it be wholesome, by reason of its com- pactness and facility of transport, in campaigns where fresh meat is not always obtainable. I
			of dust and bi2L'ing odours of no fragrant quality from the carcaseS oi PS coupnle of camels which for some days-little to the credit oi the police of the camp-havebeenputrefying ina field between usand the city. In the absence of more exciting occupation, many of the inmates of the head-quarters camp are taking a stroll up and down the street, and gaining an appetite, the conversation for the most part turn- ing, as you may easily suppose, on the probability of a speedy return to Spain. The veriest novice, sud- denly set down in the middle of the promenade, must detect the fact that he is among men who have gone through a hard campaign. Patched and thread- bare uniforms, countenances tanned almost black by sun, wind, and rain, faces] haggard from dis- ease that has but just departed, here and there alimp or a slung arm, combine to tell a tale of recent hard- ships and combat, vwhile the freshness of certain em- broiderieshints thepromotionthey have won. In the centre of the stree', with rapid step, strides up and down the taU figure of O'Donnell, the collarof his blue overcoat turned up about his ears to keep off the sharp wind and annoying dust. On his right hand is a short man, with prominent nose and a some- what careworn face, on whose cap are the insignia of a lieutenant-general. This is Garcia, the Chief of the Staff. On his other flank walks a burly, jovial- looking general, talking with much animation and occasional gesticulation. It isRios, commandingthe 4th corps, and who made the flank march on the right on the 23d inst. Suddenly an aide-de-camp hurries up to the General-in-Chief, and points in the directionof the plain, at the same time making a rapid com- munication. Some of the Moorish marauders who lurk about the foot of the mountains south of the valley and in the ueinhbourhood of the road from
			the shore to Tetuan, have seized a couple of mules and are hurrying them off to the hills. They are plainly to be seen passing over the fields and through the orchards, and in a short time they will be out of reach. O'Donnell's voice is heard, loud and shrill, as it becomes when he is angered, giving di- rections for the instant pursuit of the robbers. The General is not in the best of humours, for he has been pestered and disgusted by innumerable appli. cations for promotion and decorations, for which, now that the war is over, an extraordinary avidity is exhibited. His tone admits of no delay. Car- bineers. civil guards, and several officers spring to their horses, and scamper down into the valey, making for a ford a considerable distance towards the sea. There is one much nearer to Tetuan, but they do not know it, and they ride east along one bank of the stream, while the Moors hurry w'.t along the other. The depredators, per- ceiving themselves discovered and pursued, re- double their speed, and their wild burnous-draped figures are seen scudding across the country at an extraordinary pace for men on foot. An officer on a gray horse is foremost among their pursuers, far ahead of the others. A party of Iufantry quits camp at the double, and makes for the nearer ford. From the platforms of head-quarters the whole scene is plainly discernible in the rays of the sinking sun, and the sight is animating and interesting enough. The chase isvigorously kept up. Thegrayhorse reaches the ford, dashes across, and turns to the right. The Moors are far ahead, but the horsemen are swift and there is still an hour's daylight, it wiU yet go hard with the stealers of mules. The countryis swampy and broken by hedges, and the horsemen are scattered aU over it, now plashing through water and throwing up thousands of glittering drops, then forcing their way through orchards and thick plantations. The gray keeps the lead, followed pretty closely by about a dozen others; the rest are far behind, aud will hardly be in at the death; here a saddle has turned, there a horse has faUlen. The country is more and more wooded, and fugitives and pursuers are frequently lost to view. Meanwhile, the active infantry, a part of the Generars escort, have crossed the ford, and are pushing across country at a good five-miles-an-hour pace. There is a shot, and another, and another; several fonlow. The MIoors are but six or eight; but, driven to bay, they show fight. It is get- ting dusk, and it is dinner time; there is little now to be distinguished, and most people turn into their tents, and apply them- selves to the discussion of stews, which it needs a campaigning appetite to stomach. In another half hour, or little more, there is again a stir in camp, and a rush to the tent doors to seek its cause. A young captain of cavalry rides up the main street, followed by a handful of dragoons, whose horses reek with sweat; in the midst of the soldiers come the culprits, three wretched looking Moors bound wrist to wrist, the face of one of them covered with blood from a wound in the head. They are hideous-looking barbarians, whose counten- ances alone would qualify them for the gallows, and who evidently suspect, judging from their down- cast looks, that, some such fate may be in re- serve for them. They are led up to the tent of O'Donnell, who shows himself at its entrance. The officer makes his report. "NNada, nia ! fus- larlos !" cries the Commander-in-Chief. The prompt mandate is, however, modified. The prlsoners are sent to the guard-house, and will be disposed of in the morning. Theparty of robbershad resisted despe- rately. One of them had fiercely assailed the rider of the gray-an officer of gendarmes-cutting at him with his goomia, but the blows were par- ried and the striker cut down. Three or four Moors
			were killed fighting; of the prisoners brought in one is likely to find little mercy, for the muleteer deposes to his having been active in depriving him of his beasts. It is most likely, however, that all F three will be handed over to the commander of the Moorish cavalry, which has lately been stationed some way to our left for the purpose of restraining the irregularities of tho Kabyles, and protecting the Spaniards from petty mC'estation. In that case their lives are not worth much, for Moorish justice is rapid and discriminates little, and the proba- bilities are that the poor wretches? heads will strew the ground before they are 24 hours older.
			Such petty incidents as these are all that now vary the monotony of camp life, or that are left for me to record. The war is over, and speedy departure occupies everybody's thoughts and wishes. The Mlarquis de la Concordia's brigade of ArtiUlery is embarking, a part of the Engineers are about to embark, a large number of officers have obtained leave to go, and, within a day or two, will have sailed for Cadiz or Alicante. As usual in such cases, there is much lamentation about the difficulty of conveying away horses, most of which have to be left to go across to Spain with the cavalry. As for selling them here, it is out of the question. Mules are more easily disposed of, although at wretchedly low prices, to the Jews of Tetuan, who, notwithstanding the joy they displayed at the entrance of the Spaniards, have not felt sufficient gratitude to pre- vent them from making all the money they could out of their deliverers, and the general feeling in camp seems to be that if the Moors quickly return and again despoil them, the Israelites will have got no more than they deserve. Meanwvhile, the old curse of cholera still makes itself felt, especially among the recently arrived por- tion of the army. The three thousand Basques, who are camped near the shore, on the swampy sand-flat near Custom-house Fort, are euffering con- siderably. The poor fellows have had but a small share in the glories of the war, but, unless they speedily depart, they are likely to come in for a fair amount of mortality. Two battalions of them were engaged on the 23d, being, I believe, with the bat- talion of Tarifa, the only part of Rios's corps that wavs actually engaged. They are a fine body of m-n, many of them of mature age, and who pro-
			bably served under Carlist or Cbristina banners doring the civil war. Their commander, General LatoOIe, is a remark-ably soldierly loDking man, with a striking countenance and full gray
			beard.
			Of the whole army General O'Donnell is, perhaps, the man who feels (or at least testifies) the least desire to depart. It was generally thought that, peace once made,he would be sent for from Mladrid, where it is believed that his presence is required for political reasons. As yet, however, there are nr, symptoms of his moving. To a number of the officers attached to his staff, and for whose services he has no longer occasion, he has given free leave to betake themselves to Spain, a permis- sion they are not slow in profiting by. The young Count d'Eu has been telegraphed for from Madrid, where his aunt, the Duchess of Montpensier,now Is, and will sail to-morrow or next day for Cadiz. The Velasco man-of-war steamer in taking in a quantity of artillery and ammunition. A number of officers will go by the same opportu- nity, and many others by the Torino, now lying off Fort martin, and which will soon leave for Cadiz. Baron Clary, the French officer who was at thesa head-quarters, has left, and the other foreign officers either have gone or are on the point of going.
			I am informed that a medal is to be given for the campaign in Morocco, similar to that which England gave for the Crimean war, with the head of the Queen of Spain on one side and on the other a list of all the actions fought. These are 23 in number, but many of them were mere skirmishes, or at least very trifling affairs. There has been a great deal of promotion in this army of late, and will probably be more. A1 the major-generals out here have been made lieutenant-gonerals, a large number of brigadiers have been raised to major-generals, and a host of colonels have added to the threea stripes upon the coat cuff, which mark that rank, the embroidery that indicates the higher one of brigadier. The posts of Commander- in-Chief and Minister of War are no enviable ones at a time like this; those dignitaries are worriec almost to distraction by the multitude of applica- tions and petitions, for, unfortunately, in the Spanish service, every officer at the close of a cam- paign, even if he has taken but a small share in it, thinks himself entitled to reward merely for havlng done his duty, and in the scramble-for such it is -it but too frequently happens that such rewards are obtained rather by importunity and intrine than by extraordinary merit.

			HUNGABY.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-The struggle which the Protestants of Hungary have maintained and stil maintain against sheer obstinacy from high quarters, encouraged and supported by their countrymen of the Catholic faith, inasmuch as they have raised a powerful voice to claim the restoration of deprived rights, has given a new and undeniable proof that Hungary has laid aside prejudices, and is more advanced than is perhaps supposed abroad.
			The existing Government acknowledges it itself, (it is true not publicly), that Hungary is the most mature portion of the Monarchy, for here it has been able to carry out the emancipation of the Jews without danger to the descendants of Moses, while, for instance, in Tyrol, even now-to the shame of our century be it said-Protestants are not allowed to possess lauded property.
			It is di&amp; cult, nay, almost impossible, for all those who are fortunate enough to live beyond these fron- tiers to understand the skill which the Government knows how to employ to prevent the voice of evei the most just claims being heard.
			Thus did the Government succeed in maklng foreign countries believe that the Catholic clergy perfectly agreed with the Concordat. It is true that hitherto the Catholic clergy of Hungary has re- mained silent, and only awaits a favourable oppor- tunity to raise its powerful voice. The autonomy of the Hungarian Church is unimpeachable.
			Can it be supposed that a Church vwhich dates from the times of St. Stephen, the firat King of Hungary, whichreceived aU its rights and privi- leges from Kings and Popes, should relinquish them all, because an Emperor who is not apostolic (as he can only be so as King of Hungary) has taken into his head to conclude a Concordat ?
			The Convention concluded between Francis Joseph and the Pope is his misfortune-it is his weakness. Like Pius IX., he stands isolated.
			The excellent leading article in The Times of the 3d of February (which has been translated and largely circulated throughout the Monarchy), well suited to convince every man for his own good -failed to do so, as it was not strona enough to arouse those who labour under delusion and de- ception.
			The witticism in Vienna-" What is the difference between the former Jewish dominion and the Austrian dominion ?"-with the answer,-" Thern ono man died for all;" " Now allmendie for one"- would not be bad, if, unhappily, it were not too true.
			The seed of discord planted centnries ago and fostered in the different nationalities has been re- moved from Hungary. All the other races which. form, as it were by a miracle, the Austrian Alonarchy, know it only too well, that Hungary is by no means narrow-minded nor selfish in her wishes; what Hungary claims back she would readily see extended to the other parts of the Monarchy.
			It seems as if Providence had elected Hungary to play the part of champion for the welfare of forty millions of fellow-men.
			We shaU endeavour to carry it out, and, with: God's help, succeed if the support of our brothers of other races does not fail us.
			A HUNGARIAN.

			COURSORS AND OURSERS.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES.
			Sir,-It is hard to be asked to teach an English gentleman the English language through the medium of Thte Times, but if Mr. Bowyer wiU not take the trouble to refer to his dictionaries I sup- pose I must do so for him.
			The best of our " good old dictionaries" Is Bailey. This careful lexicographer gives the word " curser" thus-
			" Cur'ser [curser L.], a courier, an express, a mes- senger of haste."
			Is Mr. Bowyer satisfied ?
			It is not fair in Mr. Bowyer to challenge me to discuss the action of an excommunication with him. I am a plain man, zealouB for my mother tongue, but knowing and caring nothing about what rusty thumbacrews or ragged Sanbenitos may be found in the marine storeshops at PRome. I have read my Tristram Sitandy, and thoroughly believe that the form of excommunication of the Church of Rome read by Dr. Slop was the real authorized version. I agree with Uncle Toby when he declares that his heart would not let him curse the Devil himself with so much bitterness. More- over, I have read that " Sketch by Boz" wherein the little pieman, being sentenced to be excommu- nicated for a fortnight, and to pay the costs, peti- tions to be allowed to be excommunicated for his natural life, and that the other party may pay the costs. I assure MIr. Bowyer that this is all I know about excommunication. It is true that I have read two documents which were printed in The Tiimes eome days ago as acts of the Pope, and one of them seemed to me to befull of drivel, and tho other full of curses. I advise slr. Bowyer not to recite the second of these before any magistrate, for our law punishes cursinrg and swearing and druinkenness with al! equal fine, and the magistrate may think it necessaryto do hisdutyand fine him forprofane swearing. However, I will ta6e hia and BoA'
			pieman's word for it that, so far from an excom- munication being a curse, it is only the Pope's way of leave-taking. WVhy does not MIr. Bowyer try a fall on such matters with Bishop Ernulphus, or Dr. Slop, or Mr. Spurgeon, or Mr. BrYan King, or Dr. Cumming, or any other great Ecclesiastical autho.. rity, and not with a person so totally unread in such matters as
			Sir. vours, &amp;C.,
			PI'ECIJISER ?

			FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
			FRANOE.
			tA portion of the following appe-red In onz second edtiLon of vesterdaav-1
			(xRoM OURn OWNv CORBMSONDENT.1
			PA,RS, MoN-DAY, Apnam 9, 6 P.M.
			The attention of the Government has been called to the articles of the Patrie, to which I alluded yesterday, charging the English with belng the in- stigatora of the Carllst insurrection in Spain and the revolutionary troubles reported from Sicily. I cannot say whether our Government has conde- scended to take notice of this libel, but IL. Thouvenel has communicated with the Minister of the Interior on the subject, and both with the Emperor. His Majesty, it is said, drew up with his own hand a "' communiqui," to be inserted in the Patrie and other papers, giving a contradiction to the calumny; and this morning, before its inser- tion, a copy of the article was sent to London.
			It was meant that the Spanish insurrection should explode in October last, when the army had embarked for Africa. Count de Montemolin, fur- nished with a French passport, arrived here from Naples, and soon after proceeded to Trieste, to con- fer with a female member of his family. Some delay occurred in bringing about a reconciliation between him and Cabrera, the Prince having on pre- vious occasions shown but little disposition to share the fatigues and dangers to which he had no objec- tion to expose his followers. The reconciliation was, Itis said, brought about by Elio, one of the most consistent, able, and chivalrous of the Carlist Chiefs.
			The report of the capture of the leaders is, I sup- pose, certain. One of the persons arrested is, it seems, nearly related to the Montijo family, and will, I have little doubt, get off; and, if his life be spared by the Spanish Government, it would be unfair to shoot the others.
			I hear that the Minister of Justice has addressed two confidential circulars to the Presidents of the Civil Tribunals and the Procureurs-Imp6riaux, one recommending them not to neglect prosecuting clerical offenders, without regard to rank, for any Infraction of the organic laws of the Concordat ; the second recommending an inquiry into the origin of the property held by religious communities, and as to the period at which such property may lapse,
			When it was first known to the Emperor Na- poleon that General Lamorliere had listened to ohe overtures from Rome to organize the Pontifical army, His MIajesty is said to have exclaimed, "Oe Joes u, mnais Glest chevaleresque r'-whether in plty for the folly, or sympathy for the chivalry, tRhey who knowv how it is HRis Mlajesty's glory to make war for an idea, and for an idea oniy, will de- clde.
			Wfhen the rumours of those negotiations first got abroad a few of the papers declared that Lamori- ci6ro would, by accepting service under a foreign Government, forfeit his rights and condition as a Frenchman, and they hinted that it was little short of treason. It was then, of course, supposed that the Emperor would refuse his sanction; since the contrary is known this dutiful portion of the press has been silent. To these objections on the loss of citizenship an answer could easily be given. The Emperor of the French once entered the service of a foreign State-Switzerland-the loss of whose neutrality is, it seems, to be the retribution for her acceptance. In the military schools of Louisbourg (Wtirtemberg) His Imperial EHighness Prince Napoleon first acquired the know- ledge and showed those talents for military com- muand which were afterwards signally displayed in the Crimea and in the memorable operations at the head of the 5th Corps during the Italian campaign. These are undeniable facts, yet I do not believe that either the Emperor or his cousin forfeited the cha- racter of Frenchmen.
			A little k-nowledge of the previous career of Gene- ral Lamoricicre, of his position and his character, will explain whatever may be thought strange in the resolution which he has adopted with reference to the Pope. Lamoricire is a native of Nantes; he belongs to an old Legitimistfamily,who were strongly prepossessed in favour of the elder branch of the B3ourbons, and who fought for the cause during the wars of La Vendee. He was born in 1806, and was a pupil at the Polytechnic School in 1824; he two years after entered the Ecole d'Application at MIetz, and got his commission as Second Lieutenant of Engineers in the begainning of 1830. In the same year he accompanied the expedition to Algiers under lBIarshal Bourmont, who took the citv on the 5th of July, only three weeks before the Revolution which overthrew the throne of Charles X. Bourmont had hardly received his MIarshars staff for his successful conduct of the expedition when he learnt the fal of his master, and his own dismissal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Africa. To Lamoricidre's honour be it said, that, though he was but then commencing his career as a soldier, he did not hesitate to testify his respect to his faDen General, regardless of the consequences to himself; he was, I believe, the only man who attended him to the ship that bore him to exile. When the Duke of Orleans was proclaimed King by a majority of the Chambers of Deputies many ofiicers of the army sent in their reslggnations,andretired from theservice. It was expected that LamoriciAre would do the same. His love for his profeesion, however, overcame his dy- nastic partialities, if he really had any, and he in- c.urred the deep displeasure of his family by con- tinning to serve under a Prince whom they look-ed upon as a usurper. It was only after the lapse of 10 years, and when Lamoriciere had already started into fame, that his reladons in the west of France would renew their intercourze with him.
			Africa was the nursery of soldiers, and among the chiefs whom these campaigns have rendered illus- trious few had a oetter title than Lamoriciere. lis talent for organization was remarkable. Soon after the taking of Algiers there was created the corps of Zouaves, now so well known to Europe, and Lamoriciere was named Captain in that body, to whose formation he principally contributed. In 1833 he was appointed Director of the first Bureau Arabe, soon after promoted to chej de batailon, Lieutenant-Colonel in 1835, and, on the taking of Constantine in 1837, got his commission as Colonel for the intelligence and great gaUantry he displayed on that occasion. He laid with his own hands the powder bags to the gates of Constantine, and, the explosion having taken place too soon, was " hoisted with his own petard," and severely wounded. In 1839 he was recaUed to Paris. He returned to Africa the folloving year, and again distinguished himself at MhIoujala; indeed, he appears never to have been present in the field without distigngishing himself. In the same year he waspromoted to Major- GJeneral, in 1843 to General of Division, in 1844 he was made Commander of the Legion of Honour, and in 1815 Governor of Algeria ad interim. General Lamoricijre shared, durig his stay in Africa, in no le3s than 18 campaigns; not one of his promotions and honours but was the reward of some expe- dition planned by him, or some brilliant exploit successfully achieved. He closed his military career In Africa by a double success. It was he who organized the expedition which ended in the capture by the Duke d'Aumale of Abd-el-Kader, who was so hemmed in by Lamorici4re as to have no resource but to surrender.
			It is not certain what were the political principles or preferences of Lamoricl6re-probably he did not know them himself, He acted, however, with the Liberal party, and towards the close of Louis Philippe's reign took his seat in the Chamber of Deputies with the Dynastic Opposition, and ,va designated as Minister of War in the Thiers, W,o16, or Barrot combinations essayed by the Kina in his last strnZale.
			In the sanguinary conflict of June, 1848, which aeluged the streets of Paris with blood, he offered ihis services to his old comrade Cavaignac, then haead of the Government. During those terrible ihree days he seemed to multiply himself: he wva
			frst wherever the danger was greatest, and to his twonderful energy was the suppression of that fideons insurrection mainly owing. He remained faithful to the policy and the fortunes of Ca- vaignac; he attached himself to the moderate sec- tion of the Republicans, and voted with the Left only on the question of the two Chambers. He addressed the Assembly frequently, always with a tact and skill In debate which resembled instinct, and not rarely with an eloquence which astonished weven practised orators. He stood in the tribune as a consummate rider masters a fiery charger.
			After the election of Prince Louis Napoleon to the 3prestdency Lamorici6regave nosystematic opposition to the Goyernment, though he disapproved the po-
			I;cy adopted on Italian affairs, and he continued the consistent supporter of the Republican Constitution. At the period of the Russian intervention in Hun- gary in 1849 he accepted a mission from the Presi- dent to the Court of St. Petersburg, where he ar- rived after the submission of Hungary, and was re- ceived by the EmDeror Nicholas with the greatest distinction. On learning the fate of the Odillon Barrot Ministry he resigned his post of Ambassador and returned to Paris. He resamed his place in the Chambers, and devoted all his influence to combat the policy and baffle the plans of the Elys6e. In July, 1851, he recorded his vote against the revision of the Constitution, and in November following for the Bill which was to place the military force under the control of the Assembly in case of any attempt against the Constitution. In the coup dftat of the 2d December he was comprised among the eminent men, civilians as well as military, who were caught by order of the new Minister of the Interior, M. de Morny, who was then exercising the sublime vocation ofsavinghiscountry. Lamoricirehad the bad taste t,o attempt to resist the commands of that patriot; and his servant, who aided him in this revolt against AL de Mlory's agents, was wounded. Lamoricelre was overpowered by numbers, and conveyed to the prison of Mazas. He was quickly transferred to the classic retreat of Ham, and thence conducted by the police to the frontier. Being still borne on the list of general officers on active service, he vas sum- moned to take the oaths of allegiance to the new ESmperor; he refused in strong terms, in a letter which appeared in the foreign journals. From that period till 1857 he chiefly resided in Belgium. In that year the Emperor spontaneously authorized him to return to France, on the sudden death of one of his children.
			The bitterest pang that a man like Lamoriciere could feel was on the occasion of war being declared against Russia in 1854. He was passionately at- tached to his profession, he was in the vigour of life and intellect, several of his old companions in arms were going forth to wvin new distinctions in a war on a grand scale, of which the duration was uncertain, and he, the bravest among brave men, was left to pine in an obscure retreat, all the " pride, pomp, and circumEtance of glorious war" passing before his eyes, and he not sharing in it. It was to him a season of great anguish. It was at this moment that his thoughts took a devotional turn, and in the practice of religion he sought consolation for the disappointment of his hopes and his noble ambition. A friend of his, a man eminent as a littrateur and a politician, and who was at one time a member of the Cabinet under Louis Philippe, calling upon Lamoricibre one day, found him deeply engaged over some military maps and plans of the Crimea, but he also observed, to his surprise, books of religion lying open by their side on the same table. He rallied the General on the serious turn which he evinced, and doubted his sincerity. Lamoriciere assured his friend that he was never more sincere, and that religion was the areat comfort of his life.
			The thought of asking Lamorlcidre's assistance in the organization of his army was not, I beieve, suggested by any one to the Pope: it was entirely his own. Monsignor Merode, who was employed in the negotiation, served for some time in the Belgian army, and subsequently in Africa with the French, where he was decorated with th' Legion of Honour. He visited Rome subsequently, became an ecclesiastic, and was appointed Chamberlain by His Holiness. General Lamoriciere is connected by marriage with the Merode family, and no better negotiator could have been selected.
			As the Emperor of the French, who, perhaps, hopes that Lamoriciere may act as a check on the Pledmontese as well as on the subjects of the Pope, has given permission, we may consider the General as Commander-in-Chief of the Pontifical army. We hear that his report is rather favourable than otherwise;thathefoundgoodmaterialamongthemen; and that the officers are possessed of a fair amount of theoretical knowledge on military subjects, but of course deficient in practice. Time will show whetber he will perform the same miracle with the Roman that Marshal Beresford did with the Portu- guese levies. In themeantime large sumsof money have already been collected in Paris and in the de- partments, among the old Catholic families, for the service of the Pope; and several members of the aristocracy are going to serve as volunteers in his troops. Among these the Duke deILarochefoucauld Doudeauville gives up 10,0001. a-year, the half of his income, to maintain a guard of honour ; and -his son, Count Sosthenes, takes service in the Pontifical ranks.
			The Minister of War is occupied with the im- provement of the cavalry. It was perceived in Italy that the cavalry was not as efficacions during that campaign as on former occasions. This arose from the fact of the infantry soldiers being armed with rifles, by which they were enabled to reach the cavalry at a long distance, and thus destroy the efficacy of their charge. Manceuvres are to be tried at the camp of Chalons and at Lunevi31e, which It is hoped will restore to the cavalry their ancient prestige.
			The Courier of the Alps announces that French engineers are travelling through the lately annexed provinces of Savoy and Nice, and that they have commenced making plans for numerons public works to be executed. A survey is to be made of the provinces on the plan of the French cadastre; railways are to be constructed, new public roads are to be laid out, and telegraphic wires laid down. The engineers have commenced their ope- rations in Chablais and Faucigny. A notice posted at tho Town-hall of Nice announces that the engineers of the Lyons Railway Company are authorized to execute plans for the comple- tion of the railway from Toulon to the Var. It is announced, on the same authority, that Prince Napoleon and the Princess Clotilde propose to visit, after Easter, Nice, Chambery, and the principal towns of-the newly annexed provinces. The Em- peror has decided on the report of the commissioners sent into the annexed provinces that the privates now forming the army there shaU be discharged, and that the contingent to be levied annually in future shall amount to about 4,500 men, in place of 17,000 hitherto drawn by conscription. The vote by universal suffrage on the question of the annexa- tion of Savoy and Nice to France is to be taken on Sunday, the 22d inst. There is no doubt of the result. The Dowager-Empress of Russia gave a grand soirec musicaZe last week at Nice, to which General Froissard, the Emperor Napoleon's aide-de-camp, was invited.
			The following extract from the speech of M. Pouher, the Minister of Agriculture and Com- merce, at the cattle show of Poissy last week, de- monstrates tho great advantages French farmers Wmill deriv from the late Treaty of Commerce con- cluded between England and France:-
			" To increase the quantity of cultivated land and its productive power Is to resolve one of the terms of the pro- blem-will the increase of consumption sustain and remu- nerate these efforts? Were the French markets alone open to us the progressive power of these markets would be a cause of security, but the new comnmercial relations esta- blished with Great Britain-the modification of the Customs' tariff, which has been the consequence-extend our horizon and facilitate the development of our strength. England offers us an ever-assured market for our corn, our wines, and for every species of food. We exported to GreatBritain In the year 1SS native produce to the amount of 150,000,000f. If the Almighty protects our crops, if a more liberal code of laws should aid our commerco, owr exports ,will receive a most active impulse."
			The Avenir Commnrcial demands that the Treaty of Commerce with England shall be modified with respect to the mode in which the duty on French wines imported into England is computed. The treaty says that French wines containing not more
			than 18 degrees of alcohol shall pay a duty' equiivalent to 63f. 30c. for a cask containing 228 litres, and al wines containing more than 1S degrees of alcohol shall pay for the same measure 94f. 95c. The consequence of this arrangement, according to the A renir Commercial, will be that Bordeaux wines will pay half less duty on arriving in En.dand than Burgundy wines, and that Burgandy will be sacri- ficed. Again, the strong,coarse wines of the llerault, which are shipped in such large quantities from Cette, will pay in England 50 per cent. more duty than the most expensive Bordeaux wines. The Pre- fect of the R6crault. and the Chamber of Commerce of IMoutpellier, supported by the wine Commissioners, have, it is said, oDened the eyes of the Emperor to this anomaly, and demonstrated to the contracting Powers the impossibility of equitably taxing wines on their arrival in Englaid according to the quan- tity of alcohol they contain.

			SARDINIA.
			THE SARDINIAN PARLIAM1ENT.
			(FtROM OUR OWN CORRMO'NDEYT.)
			TURIN. AJPRTL 7.
			A great many of the Emilian and Tuscan deputies have gone back to their own countries. Not a few left almost immediately after the " Royal sitting." The impression was and is that no very important discussion wiU take place previous to the King's journey to Central Italy, for which the appointed day is stll said to be the 15th or 20th. The short incident of Garibaldi's question of yesterday, how- ever, ought to prove how rash it is for a representa- tive of tho people to absent himself, reckoning on the inactivity of the House. In the meantime the preliminary work of the verification of powers has boeen hurried through with unprecedented briskness, and is likely to be brought to a conclusion to-day. One sitting on Monday or Tuesday may suffice or the election of the President and aU the sub- altern officers, when Garibaldi's " interpallana " will no longer be so easily shirked as it was last evening.
			The real fact is that the deputies from the Romagna and Tuscany did not weU consider the drawbacks in- separable from the Parliamentary honours which they so eagerly coveted. The Turin climate is too well fitted for the capital of a constitutional kind- dom. With the exception of a glimpse of sunshine to cheer the King on the deliverance of his opening speech, the weather has been as dark and murky, sticky and sloppy,as it ever was in London between October and May-a perpetual gloom for a whole week, only occasionaly enlivened by more or less heavy showers of rain; and yet for a Florentine or Bolognese the climate is, on the whole, the best t.hing Turin has to offer,-hardly a picture or statue, a church, a palace, or any other achievement of truly Italian genius to afford food for the mind in- doors to people debarred from the luxury of loitering out of doors. Talk of tne attachment of Swiss or Tyrolese mountaineers for their rugged high- land homes ! There is no local patriotism so strong as that of the Italian for the town that gave him birth. He can sun himself nowhere so well as in the shelter of its walls; nowhere can he cast root so firmly as between its paving-tones. There is very homesickness in the idea of losing sight of the belfry of Giotto or the tower of the Armelli. An English squire, bound by taste, habit, and cir- cumstances to his comfortable but somewhat dull gentilhommi&amp;re in the country, is too fain to break through the sameness of his farming and sporting life to go to London for four or five months, where, besides his Parliamentary duties, he fiinds all that the genial arts of civilization can contrive to interest and entertain him. Parliament is almost the onlv link which connects his solitude with the world ; the loneliness of six months giving relish to a season's social intercourse; the annoyances of society yield- ing new attractions to rural retirement.
			For an Italian landowner there is, indeed, the same alternati ,e between toown and country enjoy- ments as in England. Only a Tuscan or Lombard nobleman or gentleman has already his villa in Carentino or the Brianza, no less than his palace at Florence or Mlilan. Parliamentary life implies for him the necassity of a third homo, and it seems rather too hard to ask of him, when he has gathered in his corn in July, and bottled his wine in October, that he should exchange his ancestral mansion in the Via Larga or the Corso di Porta Orientale for a dank, clammy pair of dingy, yet expensive, rooms in a Turin hotel. A Tuscan's ears, also, must suffer excruciating torture in having this terrible Pied- montese patois incessantly dinned into his ears under the thronged porticoes of Via di Po. Alto- gether his public career presents itself to the newly emancipated patriot just returned to Parliament under rather dreary auspices. Things will mend in time, no doubt, and find their own level. Perhaps Turin will change its nature, or perhaps the kingdom will change its capital, or by degrees provincial towns will lose their importance, their society, their manifold attractions, and all the wealth and ele- gance of the country will concentrate itself in a great Italian metropolis.
			However the wheel of fortune may turn for the future, the fact is that we have barely balf a House full of deputies for the present. Some of the mem- bers have not arrived yet, and many have left us already; we have, moreover, no less than 25 mem- bers, each of whom was returned by more than one constituency. Count Cavour is deputy for nine different colleges, Farini for seven, M,amiani for siX, La Farini and Pepoli each for five~ &amp;c. We shall have certainly no less than 6-some say even 90- vacancies in the House before it has legally consti- tuted itself, so that for the whole of this short ses- sion it will take no slight trouble to keep the House to its legal number-one-half of the members and one,-without which it is not allowed to sit for the transaction of public business.
			The President opened the sitting by the announce- ment of the death of General Quagglia, in consequence of the fit of apoplexy with which he was struck in the House the other day, or perhaps of the doctors who drained the poor aged gentleman to the last drop of his blood (four bleedings in 24 hours,three of them after his recovery from the fit).
			The order of the day once more led to the " veri- fication of powers." Mfany elections were submitted to the approval of the Chamber without any remark. The turn then came of those elections on the sub- ject of which discussion had arisen in the sections or even in the Chamber itself, the decision of which had been adjourned.
			'ilie electon ot .rotessor lie Maria again became the theme of long debate. Signor Bo, a Professor of the University of Genoa, and a member of the General Board of Marine Health, was declared yes- terday to be duly elected, because as a professor he was eligible under certain restrictions, and in his capacity of member or director of the Board of Health his eligibility was only doubtful, and the Chamber decided that the benefit of the doubt should be extended to him.
			Professor De Maria was in the enjoymen4; of an office as member of the Upper Board of Health, and of another as an Inspector of Academical Studies. Of these two offices the latter only excluded him from the House of Deputies. The question whether the eligibility attaehing to one of the offices could counteract the ineligibility attendant on the other again gave rise to a controversy, in which the reporter on the election. Chiave, Pro- fessor Pescatore, and the Minister of Publie Instruc- tion, MIamiani, spoke for the admission of De MIaria, while Chio, Michelini, and others insisted on his exclusion.
			The object of the law in admitting professors and other learned officials into the House in spite of the Balaries which, according to the general rule, excluded them, arose from a consideration of the special information which every one of them could bring into the debates of the Chamber with respect to the peculiar branch of knowledge in which he was proficient. Count MIamiani especially com- plained that too smaU a proportion had been allowed to the learned professions in Parliament, and he adjured the House not to add to the harshness of a niggardly law by a stil narrower interpretation; that ihe world was ruled, not by material interests, but by great ideas of freedom and progress, and that they would iU provide for the real advancement of society unless they secured for learning and genius a prominent place in their deliberations.
			On the other hand, Professor Chio and Michelini urged that an inspector of auperior studies had
			his time too utterly absorbed by manifold avoca- tions to have leisure to bestow his attention upon the proceedings of the Chamber; and it seemed cer- tainly difficult to conceive how a man could at the same time be, for instance, delivering his lecturesas a professor atPisa or Bologna, andfit daily inhisplacein the Lower House of Parliament. The abuse on that point proved to be so great in the foregoing years that Professor Bo for one, a Ministerial member, never stirred from Genoa, where he had many irons in the fire, until informed by a telegraphic despatch from Count Cavour that his vote was wanted in the Chamber; and, on the other hand, Caballa, also of Genoa, an advocate in full practice, never quitted the bar, of which he was the brightest ornament, unles the extreme Opposition party, to which he belonged, sent for him to come forth with a stunning speech in support of their principles. However, the attendance or non-attendance of a member at the House is a matter immediately concerning his par- ticular constituency, andthe Legislature can contrive no engine to enforce upon a deputy the discharge of his duties half as formidable as the Nemesis the voters will hold in their hands at the next election.
			After a vast amount of argument, in which the same reasons were again and again urged on either side, De Maria's election was approved by a rather feeble minorltv.
			It is, however, to many a fit cause for grumbling that these inspectors of University studies, whose office is by many looked upon as utterly superfluous -men whose sinecures originally yielded them a stipend of 3,000f., and whose salary has lately been raised to 6,000f.-should not sit down satisfied with their excellent appointments, but should even aspire to Parliamentary honours; and loud are the com- plaints of those who find that constitutional govern- ment is, after al, open to the objection of so much unconscionable jobberg. lt was very properly ob- jected by Michelini that to admit enqloygs to give their votes on the Budget was like giving the ac- counts of your steward to be audited by a man mn your steward's pay; and the argument, that while an officer with only one salary was excluded from Parliament, a pluralist should be eligible, reminded one of that Scotch law by which the mother of two illegtimate children is entitled to a bounty which is denied to ber who has only given birth to one.
			It is no little to the credit of the Italians that, young as they are in their experience of representa- tive government, they should as yet know so little of its corrupt practices. Out of 338 elections only one was to some extent imperilled as attainted of bribery. The five magistrates directing the election of Oggiono stated that the Marquis Giuseppe Arco- nati, who had obtained the suffrages of the vast majority, was by public report charged with tampering with the purity of some of the voters. Offences of this nature are deemed criminal in this country, and subject to heavy penalties of fine and imprisonment. As, however, the accusation against Arconati rested on mere common rumour, and the magistrates who repeated it substantiated it with no proofs of any kind, their objection was overraled, and the Marquis, who is known as a man of very high character, was declared to be duly elected.
			The Chamber bad thus examined in the bureaux 338 elections, 320 of which had been approved, and only five annulled; 13 were still in abeyance.
			On Tuesday next wec shall have the election of a President, the Vice-Presidents, Secretaries, &amp;Tc.
			Buoncampagni, Rattazzi, Lanza, and others are put forward as cindidates for the presidential elec- tion. It is very doubtful whether the first of these gentlemen would accept the dignity so long filled by him in former years even were it offered to him. He has lately applied to the Minister of Public Instruc- tion for leave to open a private free class on consti- tutional law, an evidence of modesty and true devo- tion to the public good which speaks volumes in honour of a man whose conduct has been so strangely misrepresented, and whose character has been so unjustly traduced.

			SWITZERLAND AND SIVOY.
			The following documents have been issued by the Committees representing the 12,000 signatures of North Savoy in favour of Swiss annexation
			" Savoyards of the North !
			"The question of North Savoy has just entered upon a new phasis.
			" In the treaty of the 24th of March the Emperor of the French has promised to come to an understanding about tho neutralized provinces with the Powers represented at the Congress of Vienna, and with the Helvetic Confederation.
			" In the same treaty Victor Emmanuel has reserved to us the power of manifesting freely our wishes. The same assur- ances were given to us, in a still more formal way, in the proclamation which releases us from our oaths of loyalty, and in the speech of the 2d of April.
			" In the presence of such positive stipulations the men who, without authority, had gone to offer usto Franco have felt ill at ease. What, in fact, are all those fine promises worth which they have brought ?
			" They now resort to fresh manmouvres; they know that their schemes will be baffled if the people are allowed to express their wishes in a free way. These men, who call themselves the party of order, try by every possible means to create agitation for the purpose of bringing on a foreign intervention.
			"No other object can be assigned to the hoisting of French flags in various places before Parliament, the palla- dium of our liberties, has spoken. History will tell us whether the expedition to Thonon had any other origin.
			" Citizens ! In the name of liberty, in the name of your dearest interests, we beseech you look with scorn on all the provocations addressed to you. If you find it sometimes hard to keep down the throbs of your hearts, think of the object we are all aiming at. An imprudent step may com- promise the most sacredl canse. Order and confidence in our right must be our motto; we want no other flag
			" The Preddents of the Committees,
			" BARD, JOSEPH, Advocate, Bonneville. "BETEMPS, Th. A., Engineer, Thonon.
			"FAURAX, HENRI, Advocate, St. Jalien."
			" Messieurs les Deputes,-Tho fate of North Savoy is in your hands. It rests with you to satisfy her expectations or to deceive her hopes.
			"Glorious events, the fruits of which free Italy Is now reaping, have carried with them political results that seem to render unavoidable the severance of those ties which for centuries have united Savoy to the Sardintan monarchy. These results, which we dreaded but could not but foresee, have led us, Sire, to consider closely our situation, our in. terests, our future. In these days, when the people enjoy the happy privilege of having some influence upDn their own destiny, it was our right and our dtty to study the various prospects that opened before us.
			"This studyhas ahown us that,the monarchical unity which rallied us round the constitutional throne of Victor Em- manuel IL once definitively broken, we became competent to choose for ourselves that which accorded best with our sympathies, our habits, our wants, our interests. In all theso relations, Sirs, North Savoy has a life of her own, quito distinct from that of Southern Savoy; so that, unless the wish is to make the North the slave, and a sort of insignid cant adjunct of the South, nobody can deny her the rlght to proclaim openly her preferences, and to claim loudly that her wishes bo fulfilled. We do not attempt to judge of the preferences of the rest of Savoy, and we do not refuse to recognize them. We are told that they incline towards Prance; but, if so, let Southern Savoy speak in her own name, aud not in ours. She has received no mission from us. Much less had
			those men any who, most of them at all times enemies of those liberal Ideas the triumph of which is now secure in your country, which is stil ours, seem to try to pumish our constant devotion to the cause of Italy by emothering our free aspirtions, and who, havlng taken upon themselves the sorry mission of offering to a foreign master the homage of their interesteddesertion, have arrogated tothemselves the right of speaking for us. We declare that, far from seeing with joy Savoy hoisting a new banner, we could not think without deep grief that we weregoingtoabandon theold flag, totheglory of whichwehavecontributed. Your justice, Sirs, will bear us witness so far. We protest energetically agait those so-caUed wishes that a mock deputation has dared to offer as the expression of the wishes of the whole of Savoy.
			Womay be allowed further to call to your mdnd that we have acquired, and, as Sardinian subjects, stiU hold, the right to take an Interest in the preservation of Italian inde- pendence. It is by this right that wo dare to represent to you the future dangers to which the possession by a single State of all the passes of our mountains must exDose this in- dependence. From the Maritime Alps to the Pennine Alps, from Nice to the Simplon, Italy is open, if our wishes are not heard.
			Our wishes are these:-
			If we must cease to belong to a free monarchy-if we must cease to be the loyal subjects of the illustrious House of Savoy, our wish is to become independent cltizens of the noble Swiss Confederatlon. Mure than 12,000 signatures, which will be laid before you, attest In an unexceptionable way the sincerity of this wish. We ask,but for one thing, which is, to be allowedto bear witness to it in a still clearer and more imposing manner.
			",You have yourselves, Sirs, just seen the poltical rege. [neration of Itzay brough1t out hy b 'r&amp; uiu f&amp; reh
			consulted. Grant us, to manifest our opinions, the same forms, the samo guara-tees. Let all the ctlzens of fell age be caled upon, each in his own commune, to take part in this solemn act, by a vote of each distinct province, and lot them be allowed to pronounce freely among the different alternatives that may offer themselves to their choice. The suffrages already obtained in favour of an eventual union with Switzerland render it imperatlve that this union, in particular, should be seriously submitted to the vote.
			" It rests with you, Sirs, to respond to this legitimate re. quest, by maling a free voting on our part a conditlon of the ratification of the treaty of cesilon laid before you for approbastion. The treaty stipulates expressly that the will of the people shall be consulted. It therefore allows you nay more, It obliges you, to take care that this consultation be serlous and sincere, and this car only be in the way we have shown.
			" Universal suffrago in each commune,votimg by province, and a fair option among all possible preferences-thils alone wUl enable NorthSavoy to make Imown its wishes distinctly. This is what we claim fromyon, Sirs; this is what you wlm grant us.

			AUSTRIA.
			(FRO-I OUPR OWN CORSR'POhDEXT.)
			VIFOINA, Arnm 6.
			The Archduke Albrecht, who returned from Pesth toViennaon Wednesday last, has obtained per- mission to retire from the highly honourable, but ex- ceedingly disagreeable post of Governor-General of the kingdom of Etung,ary. Durisg the last two years his Imperial lighnesss has repeatedly requested the Emperor to allowf him to leave Hluugary, but His Majesty, being loth to lose the services of such a faithful friend and relative, always turned a deaf ear to his solicitations. A few weeks ago, however, the Archduke so strongly insisted on retiring from office, that the Emperor had no choice bat to pro- mise that his wishes should be attended to without any further delay. As his Imperial Highness does not intend to return to Pesth again, orders have been given to his people in that city to make the necessary preparations for a speedy removal to Vienna. During the last day or two it has been related that a new system of administration is about to be introduced into Hun- gary, but I have not been able to acquire any reliable information on the subject. In diplomatic circles it is said that either the Archduke Ferdi- nand Max, or the Archduke Reignier(the President of the Council of the Empire), will be appointed Palatine of Hungary, and that important conces- sions will be made to the inhabitants of that king- dom; but a person who is frequently aware of the intentions of Government yesterday gave me to understand that it is not deemed advisable to accede to the wishes of a nation which almost openly defies His Majestv's Mlinisters. The Hungarians believe that a strictly military regimne is about to be introduced into their native country, and one of their leading men this morning stated that Feldzengmeister von Benedek was likely to be appointed Civil and Mlilitary Governor of Hun- gary. Such singular appointments are every now and then made in Austria that General Yon Benedek may perhaps succeed the Archduke Albrecht, but there is an impression on my mind that a purely military administration in Hungary would not fail to make bad worse. On the 2d inst. Baron Gabriel von Pronay, one of the superintendents of the Augsburgh Confession in Hungary, reminded his Lutheran brethren that the day which was men- tioned by Government as the latest period for the organization of the Protestant communities in ac- cordance with the Imperial patent of September the 1st was passed. On the 31st of March, the day alluded to, 226 Lutheran dommunities had I been organized in accordance with the Imperial
			patenr, ancn 6;j. communities nact d.ecllnecL to recog- nize its validity. Accordmng to authentic data, 306,78di Hungarian Lutherans have accepted the Imperial "oclroi," and 543,712 have rejected it. As not more than five or six Calvinist communities have been organized in accordance with the patent of September 1, about 1,200,000 Hungarian Pro- testants have forfeited their corporate rights. In the afternoon of the 4th inst. M. G. Forinyak, the student who was shot in the knee on tho 15th of March, was buried at Pesth with great pomp and ceremony. The funeral procession was opened by 30 noblemen bearing torches, and the coffin, which was carried by four young magnates, was followed by a great number of noble ladies and gentle- men, all of whom wore the national costume. Behind the mourners moved the empty hearse and above 100 private carriages. It is cre- dibly related that between 50,000 and 60,000 per- sons were assembled in the streets through which the procession passed, but no excesses were com- mitted, though there was hardly a policeman to be seen. The coffin was ornamented with wreaths bound up with ribands, in which were worked the national colours. Hungarians, who yesterday came to this city from Pesth, state that IVL von Forinyak is the only person who has died of the wounds re- ceived on the 15th of March; x Cseley was wounded in the arm, but fortunately the bone was not injured. The assertion that several other stu- dents were severely wounded during the conflict is neither more norlessthan a falsehood. Notlongsince CaptainvonAmbrosy, the son of anHungarian Baron, who is warmly attached to this Government, retired from the army and went to live at Temesvar. Soon after his arrival in the capital of the Banat, Baron Amabrosy was appointed "curator" (guardian) of one oA the Seniorats, but, to the disgust of his Aus- trian friends, he persuaded his Protestant brethren not to accept the Imperial patent. As the sentence passed on M. von Zsedenyl, the first person to pro- test at KTnamark against the Patent Law, has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice, he wiU be deprived of his liberty during eight calendar months. The " academy" for the benefit of the dis- tressed Croatians came off at Pesth in the evening of the 3d inst., and a very good affair it is said to have been. The first ladies and gentle- men in the land sang, played, and took part in tableau6x svivants, but none of them pro-
			duced. such an impression on the audience as Countess Bertha Nako, who played popular Hun- garian airs on the piano. The Countess, one of the most gifted and charming women in the king- do. of Hungary, was accompanied by her own Gipsy orchestra. The sum raised for tho Croatiaus must have been very large, as in several cases 51. was paid for a staU and 20I. for a box. There is now such a dearth in the military frontier districts that the State has been obliged to advance 244,000 florins to the unhappy borderers. Formerly those Austrian pariahs, commonly called "Croats," paid no taxes, but Baron Bruok, a few years ago, im- posed burdens on them which are far beyond their strengtb. Count Chorinsky, the Stadtholder of Carniola, has made an appeal to the benevolence of the public in favour of the inhabitants of Inner and Lower Carniola, who are literally starving. As is usual under such circumstances, the typhus is assuming an epidemic form.
			Count Rechberg is 1il, and it is not matter of wonder that he is so, as he is greatly overworked. Count Buol attended only to the affairs of the Foreign Department, but Count Rechberg, being Minister-President, as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs, is obliged to do the work of two men. Hlis Excellency has been advised to have an Adlatus, but he seems to think that nothing will be well done if he does not do it himself.
			The report of the local papers that the Archduke Ferdinand Max has come to Vienna is incorrect. His Imperial Highness is still at Miramare, near Trieste, and there he wiU remain until the beginning of the coming week.
			The Duke of Brabant, who left Pesth for Galatz on the 2d inst., has passed Belgrade.
			Yesterday this Government received the follow- ing news from Naples:-
			"Some factious insurgents have made an attack on the Royal troops at Palermo, but the latter, vith the cry of 'LT,ong live the King!' bravely repuLsed land dispersed them. The city is quiet.
			The season is very backward, but we have had spring weather during the last 48 hours.
			APRIL 7.
			Several of the Berne correspondents of the Ger- man and Austrian papers affirm that England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia have agreed to address a collective note to France, " in which thev, in the most positive language, wil uphold the claims of Switzerland to the northern part of Savoy," but the news iS incorrect. More than one attempt has been made by England to establish a certain unity of action between herself, Russia, Austria, and Prufssia, but the two first-mentioned PowBers refuse to pledge themselves to any particular line of con- duct. Russia is probably bound to France by secret ties, and Austria is offended with England because she has displayed so much sympathy for the
			Italians. It is said that there is an excellent under- standing between the British and Prussian Gover- ments, but there is little intercourse between the Russian and Austrian Cabinets. About a weeL ngo Prince Gortschakoff replied to the appeal made by the Swiss Government to Russia, as a party to the treaties of 1814 and 1815, but the ansvwer was not very inspiritlng, as it contained no positive pro- M-is, that the claims of Switzerland to Chablsis, Faucigny, and Carouge should be upheld. Up to the 2d inst. no official reply had been given by Austria to the Swiss Government, but it is be- lieved that the Imperial Government intends to let Switzerland have the benefit of its good. offices.
			Mlany copies of the new Strasburg paper have been sent gratis to Vienna, Berlin, Dresden, and MIunich, and also to the various cities and towns on the Rhine and Main. The title of this Gallo-German organ of the press is the Strasburg Cerrspoidentfor Western and Central ftrope, and its editor, M. D. Eirtz, strongly recommends it to the notice of those persons who believe that the maintenance of peace between France and Germany is necessary to the welfare of both countries. Although the words "prog,ress," "liberty," and -"civilization- oceur frequently in M. Hirts's programme, it is not likely to produce much impression on the Germans, who
			now regard with suspicion everything that comes from France. The Strasbutrg Correspondeent offers to insert advertisements for its subscribers gratis during the first eight days.
			The inhabitants of Baden are delighted tolhave got rid of the Mlaysenbug-Stengel Cabinet, and the more so because it, in the evening of the 31st MIarch, pub- lished a rescript in which it declared that the opinion of the Government respecting the validity of the Concordat had-undergone no change. The Grand Duke w-as not consulted by his BMinisters before the rescript was published, and it is probable that this want of deference to their Sovereign greatly con- tributedto their fall. The programme of the new Cabinet, in as far as religious matters are concerned, is, " The freeinternal development of both Churches, and revision of the Concordat by the Chambers." Our semi-official Do,zsa Zeit;cng is pleased to call the agitation against the Concordat in Baden "a Prus- sian or rather Gotha manceuvro." The Baden Landes Zeitu7g, a semi-official paper, states that orders have been given to the military authorities not to dismiss those soldiers who have served their time. The South Germau organs of the press rarely givo information on military matters, but it is known to the public that the German States on the Rhine are making great preparations for de- fence. The eighth German corps d'arraee (Wurtem- berg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt) wil soon be in possession of five batteries of rifled guns, con- structed on the French principle.
			For some time past the Innspruck Tag-Blatt, the organ of the Aristocratic-Jesuit party in the capital of the Tyrol, has made fierce attacks on tho Botzcn zGa7ette, which boldly and ably defends the interests of the nation, but it was not until Tuesday last that the latter deigned to give a direct reply to its factious antagonist. " Be assured," says the Bot-en Gazette, " that the Tyrolese wiiU soon findtho present terrorism unbearable,and recollect that there wras peace and concord in the country until the new masters" (the imported Jesuits are meant) " entered it. When the scales fal from the eyes of the Tyroleso they will cease to allow strangers to sow the seeds of discord in the land, and to persecuto those persons who do not share their opinions." It is worthy of remark that the Oesterreichische Zeittow, the organ of the Finance Department, begins to insist on the necessity of doing away vwith the disabilities under which Protestants labour in the Tyrol, because Ar- ticle 16 of the Act of Confederation says, " that a difference of confession can make no difference in the enjoyment of the civil and political rights se- cured to Christians in the countries and terri- tories belonging to the Germanic Confederation." If a member of the Bund thinks fit to ignore any of the stipulations of the Act of Con- federation Austria pounces on him at once; but she is blind to her own shortcomings. In the Act of Confederation it is distinctly said that the Stdizde shall take part in the differeat Governments, but in Austria the " Estates " have been shelved ever since the year 1851. The bull of excomnunai- cation was yesterday published here in extenso, but the only passage in it which has produced an im- pression on the Viennese is that in which there is a question of repealing the interdict. If the King of Sardinia will pay a large tribute to His Holiness for the Romagna he will probably obtain pardon, it being said in the bull that the interdict can be raised if the illegal acts are revoked, " or if another kind of satisfaction is given to the Church, tous, and to the ApostoEc Chair." The Archduke Charles Louis has recently been employed in organizing the militia (Landes-Vertlcidigu,ig) in the Tyrol, but there is no good reason for supposing that the country is in danger of being attacked. In order to rouse the patriotism of the Tyrolese the Emperor has given orders to many persons who dis- tinguished themselves during the late war. The authorities at Venice are about to make another at- tempt to get a Podesta elected, but the chances are that the Queen of the Adriatic will be without a burgomaster for many a long day to come. A person who has just come to this city from Italy avers that things are now nearly as bad at Venice as they are at 'Naples; and there is every reason to believe that be speaks truth. A student who made a short speech at the grave of young Forinyak has been arrested at Pesth. The Times was seized by the police authorities this morning.
			The Porte has at length granted permission to this Goverament to laud, the Ragusan submarine cable at Alexandria.

All the foreign Ministers had waited on the Minister of Foreign Affairs to offer coneoratu- lations on the failure of the insurrection, and Gueen Christina had sent a telegraphic despatch to Her Majesty to the same effect. A capitalist named Mauzanedo, of Madrid, on hearing of the rising, had offered to advaneo the Government 6,000,000 reals at once, and even larger sums if necessary. A noted Carlist chief named Mur, formerly adjutant to Cabrera, was with Ortega. The Balearic Islands. notwithstanding the departure of the garrison, have remained perfectly tranquil; and General Mendi- nueta, Military Governor of Aranjuez, had been appointed Captain-General in the place of General Ortega. General de la Concha, who was to have left Valencia with troops in pursuit of Ortega, ab- stained from doing so on learning that the move- ment was of no importance.

He, Cabrera, and Ortega are the only generals of real ability now attached to the cause of Count de Montemolin.

			McLRWYS R.SxTBP.N AFPRICA.$
			Of the half-explored or unknown regions of the world, Eastern Africa is at this moment attracting our chief attention. There is a variety of causes to account for its importance in our eyes, and among these there are some of which we have reason to be proud. The prominent discoverers of the day, our Arctic Odyssey apart, have devoted themselves to the investigation of its extended eeaboard, or are penetrating its vast interior recesses, with hopes of 'which we foresee only part of the consequences. Their reports, which from time to time reach us in detached passages, imply that a great work of dis- covery is going forward, and that we are oponing a vast fertile region of unknown limits and abundant resources. Our Livingstones, Burtons, Spekes, &amp;c., are assuredly the pioneers of a commerce, and possibly of an empire, of Indefinite dimensions. Without looking, however, to the possibilities of a remote future, even in the present generation we can foresee that the result of these labours will be to turn British enterprise into this opening channel, and to supplant the secret horrors of the slave trade by the influences of legitimate commerce.
			That, on the most favourable view of the case, we are only as yet on the threshold and verge of these beneficent operations is, however, made painfully manifest by the present volumes. 3lany of the readers of Mlr. McLeod's work wfill pro- bably be surprised to find to what an extent the slave trade is still encouraged, and even directly promoted, with the connivance of the Portuguese authorities. At the same time im- pediments are thrown inthe way of legitimate trade, and its avenues are obstructed in the interests of officials in almost avowed league with the slave- dealers. Mr. McLeod, who was appointed Eer Majesty's Consul at Mozambique, endeavoured to the best of his ability to cope with this evil, and, after a series of persecutions by which his life was apparently endangered, he at length hauled down his flag and escaDed from his post. He was instru- mental, among other efforts, in the seizure of the Charles et Georges, and soon after that event-as we infer, in April, 1858-his position was rendered so intolerable that he had no alternative but to quit Mozambique. It appears that Mr. McLeod arrived in London on the 17th of October, and, 20 minutes after he got out of the train, reported himself at the Foreign-offlce. But wherefore his narrative, which was so material to the questions at issue between Great Britain, France, and Portugal,was so Iongwithheldfromthe Btishpublic-whyit was not, as we infer it might have been, in our hands a year earlier, is not explained to us; and we remark that delay under such circumstauces is strange, if not censurable, and that it does, in our opinion, require explanation on the nart of somebodv.
			bx. McLeod embarked for his Consulate on De- cember 6, 185G, and his experionce of the Royal ail screw steamer Ireland, which conveyed bim to the Cape of Good Hope, inculpates the administra- tion of that vessel with the grozsest indifference to the comforts of its passengers. On his arrival at the Cape he applied to the officer in charge of that station co despatch him to Mozambique ; but,though the orders of the Foreign-office were emphatic, he was detained for more than five months, while at dif- ferent times during that interval there were three steamships of war lying in Simon's, or Table, orAlgoa B3ay. We hope that we may assume some better ex- cuse for this delay than that suggested by 31r. MIcteod-that he was left loitering at the Cape becauso the carriage of specie was more profitable than that of Consuls. For those who may not be initiated in the bearings of this alternative he ob- serves that the captains of Her Majesty's ships re- ceive a certain percentaga on all specie carried by the vessels which they command; while for carry- ing Consuls and other public Eervants they receive only a fairly remunerative amount of table-money to compensate for any expense they may have been put to in entertaining their guest.
			At length Mlr. Mc Leod got away to his destina- tion in the Hermes, but, pending his detention, he had opportunities of observing the extraordinary development of the Cape Colony, of which the re- venue had increased more than a milion in the five years from 1852 to 1857. While he was delayed at the Cape, as he learned on touching at Natal, four full cargoes of Africans were within two months ahipped from the neighbourhood of Cape Corrientes, the Governor of Inhambane and anotherperson sup- plying the slaves for these four vessels. On the other hand, Mr. 'McLeod's impressions of the natural advantages and productive capacities of Natal, the prospects of which he enters into in detail, were a cheering contrast to the scenes which awaited him in the Portuguese territories. Natal has an area of 18,000 square miles, and it is divided into a succewsion of four steps or terraces, each having an average width of 20 miles, with its own peculiarity of soil and climate. For upwards of 1,000 square miles it is capable of producing the most highly prized of the cottons of America, with- out the accompanying drawback of a climate noxious to Europeans. There are, at the lowest computation, 640,000 acres adapted to this purpose, and which will yield7T,5001lb. of clean cottonper acre, EO that our Liverpool merchants may look forward to a supply of no less than4,800,000,OOOlb. of cotton from this, one of the smallest and latest acquired of our colonies. Wool also, though doubtful at first, is now likely to become a staple product, while sugar, indigo, tobacco, coffee, and arrowroot may be expected eventually in large quantities,as wel as of excellent quality. In short, as Mr. McLeod says, Natal is "a bijon in South-eastern Arica which must have a considerable effect in cjvilizina the natives of the surrounding territories." Comprising -within its moderate limits the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics in close proximity with the temperate climate of Europe, its deficiency is nevertheless the common one-that of labour, which it requires to make its varied resources available. The Zulu Caffres will engage themselves for domestic service, and perform it weU for some six months, when they retnrn to enjoy their forest and prairie life, to drink of the milk of their own kraUs, and dance with their Caffre Hehes. But the Caffre who will clean windows and wash plates and glass very carefully is quite indisposed to labour in the field, and the only resource here, as elsewhere, appears to be the importation of Coolie labour from India or from C%ina. With a sufficiency of this labour Natal sty compete successfutlly with the Slave States of America and with Cuba, and slave labour, being so much dearer, may lose some of the markets for its produce, perhaps even to the extinction of the slave trade, from which it is still so largely recruited.
			Akt Natal INIr. MlcLeod received tidings of an American slave bark, the Miinnetonka, of which we hear mtucb in his subsequent narrative; and, as a sharp look-out was kept after this vessel from Delagoa northwards, Mr. McLeod had plentiful evi- dence of the complicity of the Portuguese with the slavedealers. As the Hermes proceeded along the coast, a succession of fires might be observed at from three to ten miles inland, warning the dealers of her approach. "At times," says Mr. McLeod, "we could almost imagine that we were overtaking these, but when we came nearly abreast of the latest beacon, and were keeping a bright look-out for our anticipated prize, another and yet another fire on the hills would tell how we were baffled, and how weli the slavedealers were serveL" Of course this could only have been done with the conni- vance of the native chiefs; and while it shows how fearfully the Portuguese have abused their position on this coast, it convinces one that they are not without influence among the natives, aDd that if they can uise it for such a purpose they mnight be equally successful in employing it in anmeliorating the condition of the blacks whom they now use only as objects of barter with the man- atealer.
			As the Hermes came abreast of Cape Corrientes the beacon fires v-ere seen north and sotuth as far as the eye could reach, alarming the whole coast; -whereupon chase was given to a vessel under the impression that it was a slaver, but which the event proved to be only a red-herring trailed across the
			ecant of the true game. This vessel, on beina boarded, proved to be the Zambesi, belonging to the, Royal Navy of Portugal, and had on board the ex- Governor of Inhambane, one Senhor Leotti, a com- tnander in the Portuguese navy, who had been comn- rnunicating, as is afterwards shown, with the
			flInnetonka slaver, for which the Hermes was then on the look-out. In fact, while the llinnetonka ws lying at anchor off Inhambane, the Portuz-iese schoonc;- Zambesi, with the ensign and Royal pennant of Portugal flying, approached, and, instead of capturing her, as she was bound to do by treaties with Great Britain (for the slaver was within gun-

			shot distance of the beach), made arrangements for supplying her with a cargo of slaves !
			At Inhambane, also, Mr. DIcLeod encountered another vessel, of which he heard subsequently this account from the Governor of Mo7ambique-a story which, though it implicates our countrymen, Mr. McLeod is inclined to credit, on the ground of the relations of some English merchants with notorious Mozambique slavedeaers :-It was stated that this vessel had loaded with a cargo of coals at Cardiff in ]856, and had clearedfor the Philippine Islands; but as soon as the master found himself to the east curd of the Cape of Good Hope he commenced throwing the coals overboard, and arrived at Inhambane with only sufficient coals to serve as ballast. The vessel wa damaged in going into the harbour, and was sub- sequently injured irreparably while undergoing the necessary repairs, and on this account the captain was obliged to abandon her. But it was stated to Mlr. hIcLeod (and we wish we could add, from a desire to inculpate our countrymen faLsely), that he bad gone into Inhambane for the purpose of receiving a cargo of slaves, arrangements for w,hich had pre- viously been made by persons in England.
			There can now be little doubt that the arrange- ments for supplying labour to the French colony of Reunion,which Air. McLeod subsequently brought under the notice of the Government of Mozambique, were also in practice equivalent to the slave trade itself. These arrangements were coupled with sti- pulations on behalf of imported labourers which clearly show that the Home Government of France was acting with humanity and good faith; but practicaUy these stipulations were of little effect, and instances occurred in which the slaves on board of the so-caled French free-labour ships had risen and destroyed all the French on board of them. In one case the slaves cut off the head of the cantain's on, and placed it on the figureheaa ot the vessel, after which they gutted and set her on fire, and then escaped to the shore. We can thus appreciate Mr. McLeod's endeavours in the matter of the Charles et Georges, ana can understand the compli- cations which subsequently arose out of that doubt- ful transaction. There is something to be said in excuse of al the parties to that national controversy, though if we had taken up the cudgels, as invited, on behalf of Portugal, we ourselves should have been sorely discountenanced by the evidence which, as we have already hinted, has come out so tardily as to the conduct of our prot6ge.
			It appears from this evidence that no sooner had Mr. McLeod set foot in MIoozambique than no efforts were spared to frustrate his mission and drive him from the colony. A r-use was attempted to prevent his presentation to the new Governor-General, who honourably contemplated the suppression of the slave trade, but was forced eventualy to sacri- fice Mr. McLeod to the animosity of the slave- dealers. For a time, however, there was a good understanding and a cordial co-operation be- tween Mr. McLeod and the Governor, aud during this interval the Charles et Georges was seized and the slave trade was in course of suppression. Mr. MeLeod ascribes the first altera- tion in his position to the want of support, or rather
			zo tne entre atanclonment ot his cause by Captain Lyster, who visited Mozambique in command of Her Majesty's frigate Castor. How this may have been we cannot undertake to affirm; but it is a fitting subject for inquiry in other quarters. Even before Captain Lyster left our Consul to his fate, the slavedealers, baffled in an attack on the Governor- General, twice attacked the Consul's house throuah the medium of their slaves, whom they sent to stone him; and, by serving him with notice to quit his house and withdrawing all his servants, they had reduced him to the state of helplessness which com- peUled him to claim Captain Lyster's protection.
			Soon after this desertion of the Britlsh Consul, the latter declares that a marked change took place in the conduct of the Governor-General of Mo7,am- bique, who now anticipated the abandonment of its
			policy by tbe British Government. The series of persecutions still proceeded, and against these the Governor-General rendered MIr. McLeod no effectual assistance. His hired servants being withdrawn, he was beset with offers of slaves if he would consent to purchase them. His letters were detained; he had no crew for his boat; he had no one to light his fire; his wife was obliged to cook his dinner and wash his linen; he was under the ban of the slavedealers, and almost deprived by their paramount influence of the necessaries of life. To mortify him, slaves were scourged under his eyes, and his Sunday morning services were designedly accompanied by the shrieks and cries of tortured negroes. an attempt was made to waylay and apparently to murder him. Those who endeavoured to selU him anything were actuaUy waylaid and cruelly beaten. He was harassed by a series of demonstrations and night attacks; stones were thrown in at his windows, and on one occasion his wife was wounded; on another, when he had three people in his house at the point of death, no medical man, though there were five available, could be induced to visit him. He intimates his suspicions that one Portuguese doctor even attempted to poison Mrs. 31cLeod in a prescription which he left for her, observing that alter she had taken it " she would require nso more," and that it would be, therefore, unnecessary for hina to call again. In short, after every allowance for the apprehensions and exaggera- tions induced by a state of isolation and helplessness, we have reason to credit the truth of his representations that there was an organized con- spiracy in the colony to render his life intolerable, and that, the Portuguese authorities having utterly failed to sustain him in honour and safety, he had no alternative to act otherwise than he did.
			He left the colony under compulsion from the Portuguese alUes,whose position as suppressorsof the slave trade we were subsequently expected to fight for; and therefore, as we said, we were entitled to his evidence at an earHler date, when it might have had its due influence on the points in controversy. At aU events, we now know what is the true ten- d.ency of Portugal in these regions. Its officials are the mainstay of the trade in slaves, while they discourage and obstruct the legitimate trade which has a tendency to supplant it. We have not dwelt on M1r. McLeod's observations to the latter effect, but his book is more permanently valuable in this sense than in any other. His information as to the riches of these coasts and of their interiors is considerable. His chapter on the resources of Eastern A-frica is supplemented throughout with a variety of particulars of the valuable commo- dities it might export in large quantities if trade were unobstructed. Indi-o, cotton, or- chilla weed, and dyewoods-the gold, mer- cury, iron, and ivory of Sofala, are accessible to British enterprise under a fairer r6gime. At pre- sent, attempts to trade with the natives are gene- rally impeded, and British vessels run the risks ex- emplified by Mr. McLeod in the case of the Herald, which was seized bv the Portuguese authorities while he was at Mozambique. It is the policy of theseauthorities to preventanycommunications with the natives which may interfere with the source of their own discreditable gains. Even the good work of Dr. Livingstone Is, to some extent, neutralized for the present. He had opened the Luavo mouths of the Zambesi to commerce after the Portugueze, to whom they were known, had reported them impas- sable, with the object of keepina our cruisers at anchor off the K-illixnane mouth of the river, while the slavers used the Luavo mouths exclusively for their own purposes. And then, when the secret was out, the Portuguese decided upon eatablishing custom-houses, with the object, says Mr. McLeod, of preventing our trading with the natives of the interior, and benefitting by the enterprise of our own countrymen. Still more do other proceedings of our allies in these waters call for inquiry, if not for remonstrance. The experiences of Mr. McLeod himself, the perse- cutions to which he was subjected, and of which the report has been so long in reaching us, are the natu- ral preliminary to further and complete explana- tions.

			JuvEmS\m THiesEs r- PARsS.-The Tribunal of Correctional Police in Paris on Saturday tried a band of 10 boys, aged from 11 to 16, for committing numerouB thefts of poultry, fish, game, pastry, shoes, and other articles ex- posed for sale at shop doors or In the markets. From a paper drawn up by one of the accused, which was seized, i- ap- peared that ehse prisoners called themselves by the somewhat ambitious title of La band a psse-partout. It appears that the band had a captain, lieutenant, eergeant, and corporal; likewise that every member of it bore a nickname, such as "Sancepan," " Radish." " Gray Cow," " My Aunt," " Turnip,"Xand so on. One of the gang was alleged to have comultted as many as 34 thefts, another 28, another 24, and the others from 19 down to 2. The trial ended in one boy, the eldest, being condemned to a year's imprisonment; six being ordered to be detained in a house of correction-three until they shouldJ be lS, and three until they should bo 20 years of age; the three others being acquitted. The parents of the boys were besides condemned to pay the costs of the case.

			MIDDLESBX SESSIONS, ApiZ 10.

			On Monday afternoon an application was made for the expenses of an attorney and counsel in a case in which a bnef had been delivered for the prosecution. In answer to the AEsistant Judge as to how ho tame to instruct an at torney in the case, the prosecutor said he was introduced by some Jerson In the avenue of the court to another person who said he was an attorney, and on being told by them that the prisoner had a counsel to defend him, and that he (pro- Eector) ought to have one on his side, he told the attorney he had better see to it. The Assistant Judge told the prosecutor he must pay the costs himself, the county vas not to be saddled with the costs of prosecutions so got up. A parcel of persona had been In the habit of ranging about the court, plcking up prosecutors, and getting up their cases, on the speculation of getting the costs allowed by the Court. A great deal of this system had been done away with. and it was the full determination of the Court to put an end to It altogether. The magistrates would

On the following morning, soon after 6 o'clock, it was discovered that three had been removed from the middle of the float, which consistod of 16 pieces altogether. The three missing pieces seemed to have been taken sp the river with the tide, and float into a dock on the Regent's Canal, where the prisoner was ultimately found dealing with them. He paid the lock dues, had the property removed to opposite a timber yard, and sold them for 131. 1Os. to Mr. Heath a bauider, in Bishepsgate. There was nothing in Use evidence to counect the prisoner with the actual taking of the wood from the prosecutors' premises, but it was proved that he had been in their service, and was perfectly well-acquainted with au about the place, and the only aecount he gave of his pohsession of it was, that ho bought it of a T. Gurney for 121., end produced a stamped receipt to that effect, but he could give no clue to where any such person would be found, and In fact no such person was known. The ptioner absented hisef after tho sale of the timber to M. Heath, unti the 20th of March, when ho went to the police-sation, and said he wanted to know the "rzights and the wrongs" of it, as he had heard ho was wanted for the wooDc, and ha was detained. He gave up the receipt.
			The defence set up and ably argued by Mr. CooraEc was that it was a bond fiet sale by Gurney to the prisoner, who had been his dupe, hy dea'ing with a stranger.
			The jury found the prisoner Guilty. Ho bad receved a goadI character.
			The AzsisTsnT JUDGn said hadl anything been known against the prisoner the Court would have felt it to be its dunty torsentence him to penal servitude. Hesestencod him. asistwas to12 months?hard labour. The prosecution was a very Important and proper one.

			eny (Befome Mr. PAYNE Deputy,)
			HryDance, 42, a half silly, haif ferocious-looking- man, was Indicted fo'r unlawfully entering a certain dwelling. houso, viz., the 92arylebone Workhouse, with intent to com- miit felony.
			The case was prosecuted by Mr. Tubbs, an officer of the parish of Marylebone, on behslf of the authorities, and it appeared from the evidence that the prisoner had been for a long,time not only a dangerous pauper, but a perfect nuisance to the parish officers, although he was allowedl 39. 6id. a-week and bread as out-door relief. One pauiper had been sentenced ,~o penal servitude for throwing vitriol over one of the officers, and because Mr. Tubbs had caused this prisoner to be punished for repeated act.s of violent and disorderly conduct, hxe had made a threat that the other one had hut a cupful, he (Tubbs) should be favoured with
			a alu at the ver first opportunity. He had been con- viteo s'ecreting a knife up his coat-sleeve with int-ent, and was so skilful in making skeleton keye that when in the workhouse be used to get all over the establishment by night, by means of those ho did make, end it was principally in consequence of thin that they would not have him In the house. In reference to the present charge, the evidence of John Buckzland,I an inmate of the house, showedl that on the night of the 17th of March the prisoner was s-en in one of the yards, and as he had no busi- ness there he informed the superintend'ent, and the Prisener, who had dropped from the wall,was found secreted behind a door armed with a poker, and an old rag was lying at his feet.a When asked what he meant to do with the poker, he said " that was his business," but on being cautioned previously not to loiter about the lodge, he said he meant to- do for some one In the house yet.
			The jury found him Guilfty, and.
			The learnied JUDGIC said it wvas evident he was a peron from whom the public should be protected, and he should therefore sentence him tD 1S months' hard labour in the House of Correction.
			The prisoner said he should like it to be four years, as he did not care abeut Coldbath-fields or the workhouse.
			The JUDGE said the sentence was passed.
			The prisoner was then removed, muttering threats.
			M1r. Tubbs stated that the prisoner had got up a subscrip- tion, or raised a sum, for- the benefit of the man sen- tenced to penal servitude for throwing vitriol,
			Henry Roberta, 44, was indictedfor having stolen 96 yards of silk, of the value of 287., the property of 'tephen Walters and others,
			Mr. Cooper prosecutedl and Mr. Ribton was for the prIsoner.
			Police-sergeant Evans, 22 G, stated that on the evening of the 17th of March he was in Worship-street, when he saw the prisoner and another man walking very fast, the other having a large bundle umder his coat. 3lefollowed them, and they then crossed Into Cumberland-street; on seeing him the other man gave the prisoner the parcel and went oif at the top of his speed. The prisoner threw the bundle into a garden, and ivent after his companion, bnt was eoon over- taken and brought back to the garden, when on being asked where the parcel had come f.rom he said he knew nothing about it, had never seen it, had not been in the company of any other man, and was on his way to the Eastern Coun- ties Railway to proceed home to Elomford. The roll of silk was one of a nsumber which had been sent ourt from Messrs. Walters and Sons, Wilson-street, Finsbury, silk manufac- turers, and was missed from the others when they came to be examined at Mr. Garratt'e, umbrella-smaker, Poultry.
			The jury found the prisoner GuiUy, and
			The CouRT sentenced him to 18 months' hard labour.
			Peter Heating was indicted on three charges of stealung clover, the property of Peter Wallace.
			tr. Ribton and Mr. Dlckie were the counsel for the pro- secutmon; Mr. F. H. Lewis was for the prisoner.

He saw an empty bottle labelled landanum on the table, and she saidcshe adtakenitall, alluding to theprevous contents oIf the bottle.

			Springato, the gaoler.-She tells me, your worahip, that it is iealousy of her husband, and she has been on her knees all the mornin prayIng for forgiveness.
			The husbanlt here camo forward and corroborated the gaoler-s statement.
			Alderman HAx.-How long have you boen marrilod to t.ho prisoner 2
			the husband being unable to answer the question, the offioer supplied the information, stating that they had been married only eight months.
			Alderman HALE (addressing the prisoner) said,-You must be a very foolish womau to poison yourself because your husband is unfaithful to you and let me remind you that the offence you contemplated is a most serious one, for the commandment, " Thou shalt do no murder," applies equaly to the taking of your own life as that of another.
			Vrisoner.-I will never do the same again, Sir. I wiU pray for forgiveness.
			Alderman HALE.-Very well. Upon that promIse I will let you go home with your husband; but if you are brought here again on such a charge you will most assuredly be tried at the Old Bailey for it.
			Edward Paley, aged 13, was charged with stealing a gold watch and chain, value 101., the property of his employer.
			This was a remanded case, and upon the first hearing it agpeared that the prisoner was an errand boy in the sergice of Mr. Cutmore a watchmaker, of St. Ann's-lane, near the General Post-ohice. The gold watch in question and other property were missed, and when the Prisoner was interro- gated on the subject, and a promise of forgiveness made to him, he confessed having taken the watch and sold it for 51. The purchaser had willingly restored the whole of the miesing property, and, as the lad's parents were very respec. table people, the prosecutor did not wish to press the charge. When the case was caUed on yesterday no one appeared to prosecute. The boy's father said he understood his son had spent the money in the usual trifles incident to children, but, notwithstanding the possession of such a large sum of money for a boy, he had not absented bimself either from Sunday school or from his situation.
			Alderman HALE said the prisoner was evldently a boy woo had fallen into bad company. He had, however, no alternative but to dismiss the case, as there was no one to prosecute, and the master bad been so unwise as to promise to forgive him in the fist instance.
			Tho prisoner's father expressed his gratitude for the leniency shown tohis boy, and took him home with him.

			MAR,noL05t0UGH-STRnET.-orgo Brown Fitzgerald, of 19, Marylebone-lane, butler out of place, was finally exa- mined on the charge of falsely representing himself to be a Mr. Maitland, and tho master of one Rober' Davis, and, as such, supplying a false character,wherebythe said Robert Davis was taken into employ as a butler.
			Mr. Lewis, of Ely-place, as before, attended on the part of the prosecution; and Mr. Edward Lewis, of Marlborough- street, for the defence.
			The evidence on two previous examinations has been already given.
			Mr. Lewis said the prisoner had been seen by one or two persons, but they, having a doubt, failed to identify him, and therefore no fresh cases would on this occasion be brought against himb; he would therefore call for judg- ment under the Act for the one case so clearly proved against him.
			Mr. BnDON, adverting to a letter he hed reocived from the prisoner since the last examination, said he was very anxious to make him believe that he had been led into this offence by a servant out of place, whom he did not know where to find, whose name was Smith and that hb had intro- duced Davls to him, who had given 'him 40s. as a present, and he had merely given him a character in a friendly way
			to retrieve himself."
			The prisoner sad he had been h:mself duped by Smith.
			Mr. BEADON.-NO case could have been made out in a clearer manner. It is manifest you are one of those dan- gerous pests to society who live by supplying characters to servants of both sexes who are themselves unable to get them in an honest and legitimate way; a proceeding which inflicts on those who take such servants on such recemmen- dations immense injury, for too often theyaro discovered to be thieves committing robberles to as great an extent as they are able. I regret exceedingly that the Act 32d George IIL, chap. 56, under which the charge has been brought, has not before this been altered, and made more severe, without pecuniary fine. The utmost I can do I will, how- ever, and I sentence yon to pay a fine of 201. and 10s. cats, in default of peying which you will go to the House of Cor- rection with hard labour for three calendar months.
			It may not be uninteresting to state the conrse pursued by the convieted prisoner Davls on his obtaining his situanton at Mr. Porter Smith's, Sheen Mount, Mortlake. Though a married man, no sooner had he got into the house, and ascertained thata young woman,a servant there, had 2001. in the bank, than he commenced making fierce love to her and soon socoeeded so far in his infamous suit that she con. sented to be married to him, fully believing him to be an honoarable man and a bachelor. The bans being pub- lished in charch, the day was fixed for the marriagei but the dlscovery of the plate robbery, and his consequent flight, happily sawved his intended victim and defeated his infamoos project, and his subsequent apprehenslon by detective offlcer Smith of the A Division and con- viction upon trial, proved to her by the facts eiidited howv much she had to be thankful for In her escapDe from a designing villain, whose object was solely to possess him- self of her property.
			Wiliam Wunsch, a German waiter, charged with vio- lently assaulting Ada Wilhiams by kicking her in the groin and otherwise itltrcating her at the hoose he lodged at, No. 11, Panton-square, was brought to the bar for final exami. nation.
			The defendant, by lis solcitor, at first wished to have the case sent for trial, but, on the deposItions being ordered to be made out, he said he would prefer a settlement at once, and!
			Mr. BEADoy, remarking that it was a bad assault, fined the defendant 51., or two months' hard labour In default.

This seemed to have bad no effect, and sas the girl frequently stopped out late at night, occasioning her family great unhappiness, this reproval appeared to have been as frequent, and the conse-
			uence was that, instead of the prisoner mending her ways, .he stayed out late again the night before this charge, came home so ill that a doctor was sent for ad it was then dis- covered that she had swallowed a fare dese of mnrlatlo acid, used by her father in his business, and the bottle usualy containing It was found to have been emptied.

			Mr. John CoUier, a schoolmaster at Paddington, said that on the previous evening he got into a second-class carriage at Kingston to come to town, and the train set off with him- self and siz other passengers in the samecompartment. After leaving Malden the prisoner said something to two respect- able-looking women who sat between him and the door. Witness did not hear It, but one of the women reuested that he would keep his conversatlon to himself, as they did not wish to have anything to say to him. Immeaiatelv afterwards the prisoner insisted on having the window down, and did lower it, bht as it was blowing hard and raining at the time the woman next the window put it up again. The prisoner insisted on the window being down, when a French gentle. man, w'.tness, and others, declared it should not, and the prioner, who was much the worse for liquor threw off his coa an ofere tofigt ay oe peset.Witness re- monstrated and begged him to be quiet, hut the return he mad for is kidnesswas t makea violenit attack on him.

The witness further said the prisoner had ,a penknife open In his hand, hut at his request he gavo It up to him.

He ad- mitted that he had threatened to use It unless the com- plainant relaxed in his rough treatment of him. He called Mr. Charles Thomaas Wilims, who said he was executor to the will of the young man's father, and had known the prisoner for some yeare, and could spealk to his character as a steady and well-condueted young man. IHe had managed the business for his mother since the death of his father.
			Mr. YAItDLEY animaAverte on the prisoner's conduct with much severity, particularly his act of drawing out and opeing a penknife, anid not denying that he had done so
			wth the intentoion to use ft. It was fortunate for him, heo said, that ho had not done so, for hadt he done it he (Mr. Yardley) should have felt it to be hts duty to send him for trial. His conduct in otherrespecta was selfish, unmanly, and disgraceful, and for the offence he must pay a penalty of 31., or inL default be iraprisoned in Wandsworthi HouLse of Correction for 21 days.

			WANDswtoRlT.-Yesterday vwas appointed for the re- turn of the summons against Mlr. Joln Eerrlson, of No. 25, Manor-street, Claphai, and a volunteer In the lGt Surrey Rifles, for an act of cruelty to a dog under clrumn- stances which have caused much attention.
			Upon the summons being called, Mr. A. Jones, a soli- citor and the complainant, rose and stated that his worship would remember that his application was against the de- fendant for wounding a dog by shooting when it was ran- ring about on Wandsworth-common with - lady and two children. There would be very little difflcnlty in the matter, as Mr. Kerrison had expressed his great sorrow for what happened, and had aspured him that it was quite a mistake. Undor these circumstances he was ready to allow the case to drop, the defendant being willing to make an npology and to pay all the expenses. It was most important that a stop should be put to rle volunteers using their alre-arms in public thoroughares, as the most dangerous results were likely to occur. The dog in question was shot through the hind quarters, and was running about at the time close to his niece.
			rir. Ic;s, if here inquired if the defendant was present. Wmr. aerrison, e young gentleman, then stood up in front of the table.
			Mr. tbaOss t then addressed him, nnd said he hoped that he saw what a dangerous practice it was. He had no doubt it was done thoughtlessly, but he ought to be more careful in future. The country was much obliged to those gentle- men for the zeal they had shown in fonning themselves into ride corps, but if they were not more cautions with their fire-arms the nubbll would have to trst more to n i nvading enemy than to their friends.
			A gentleman who appeared for the defendant expressed his thanks to the complainant and has worship for the nan. ner in which they had acted in the case. HRe said that it was one of these unfortunate occurrences arising from the indis- cretion of youth. The great fault rested with the of ficers in net having issued orders tn the first instance against using the rifles except in ball practise or on parade. If an order had been issued to that effect the accident would not have happened. He hoped it would be a cauttion to the volun- teers not to take out their ril'es in that way.
			Mr. INGiuIA said, in the open country there would not be any danger, but in the metropolitan parishes, where persons were constantly passing to and fro, it was very dangerous to use fire-arms. lle had, however, no doubt it was done in a thoughtless moment, and he therefore would allow the summons to be dismissed.
			The defendant then left the court with his friends,

			TIT y AND NAVAL INT,LLIGEN CD.
			Yesterday his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridae, Commander-In-Chlef, accompanied by Major-General Sir Richard Alrey, E.C.B., Quartermas'er-General, and. an aide-de-camp, went down to Chatham for the pu?pose of reviewing the troops at that garrison, His Royal Highness reached the Chatham station at ' o'clock,and was received by MIajor-General E yre, ConMandant of the garrison, Ccl. H. Sandham, Director of the Royal Engineer Establish- mcnt; Col. 3I, WilliAms, R. E. ; Lient.-Col. E. Stanton, CB. RBTE _ssbhb-Adjti-General; and other officers, and ws shortly afterwards joined by General Sir John F. Bur- nloyne, G.C.B., Inspector-General of Fortifications, who had previonsly arrived at Ohathans. The Duke immedi- ately proceeded to the lines, where the whole force of the garrison was drawn up, the troops being in heavy marching 4order. On arriving within the garrison a Royal salute of 21 guns was fired from the Corrwalis Battery by a party ef Marine gunners. The garrison at Chatham being now very strong, the troops on the ground made a very imposing nrray. They consisted of the 1st battalion of infantry, mnder the command of Colonel H. Jervis, including the depMts of the 7th Royal FusLeers, 24th, 35th, 43d (Light Infantry), 53d, 77th, and the St. Helena Rtegiments; the 2d battalion, to which is attached the depVt companies of the 20th, 23d (Royal Welsh Fustleera), 31st, 52d (Light Infantry), and 73d Regi. ments: the 3d battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Col. t. E. Fairtlough, which includes the 5th, 19th, 75th, Slst, 91st, and 94th depits; the corps of the Royal and Indian Engineers, under the command of Col. A. P. Ross; and the battalion of Royal Marine Light Infantry, commanded by iteut.-CoL T. 0. Moore, the whole numbering nearly 200 officers and about 5,000 men of all ranks, exclusive of the Engineer detachments and the recruits who were drawn up in their barrack squares. The whole of the men were In heavy marching order, and each man was furnishedwith ten rounds Of blank cartridge. His Royal Highness, attended by aL brilliant staff, arrived on the ground at half-past 12, when the troops, who had been formed in contiguous quar'ter dis. tance columns, received him with a general salute, the bnands playing the National Anthem. His Royal Highness then passed along the front and rear of the columns and made an Individual Inspection of the men, all of whom haave just been furnisbed with their new uniforms. Form- ing in open columns of companies, and marching past in slow and quick time, the manceuvres incidental to a field-day commenced. During the time the troops were marching past his Royal Highness frequently ex- pressed himself in terms of praise at the excellent manner in which this part of the day's proceed- ings was performed, the battalions of infantry, al- though composed for the most part of very young soldiers, marching past in a manner that was not to be surpassed by any other corps in the service. At the conclusion of this movement his Royal Highness sent for Colonel Jervis, and complimented him on the exceUent manner in which the marching past had been effected. The troops, under the command of General Eyre, then proceeded to execute a variety of other mancenvres, and, notwithstanding that some of them were of a rather complicated charac- ter, they went tlirough them with remarkable steadiness rnd correctness, proving the careful training which has been bestowed on them. One of the most interestingmovements of the day was that in which the entire force was formed into two lines, facing the east, to resist the supposed advance of an enemy, skirmishers being thrown out to repel the approach of the enemy. At the close his Royal lighn'ss had the troops formed into close column, when the field officers were caUed to the front, and his Royal Highness, addressing General Eyre and the commanding officera, ex. pressed his deLght and satisfaction at the appearance and proficiency of the troops of that garrison. The various evolutions had been performed In an exceedingly creditable
			arnd satisfactory manner, and the discipline and appearance of the men generaly reflected the highest credit on all the officers in command. From the few esxresslons used by the Duke it was evident that the proceedings of the day engaged his deepest attention. At the close of the address of his Royal Highness the troops returned to their quarters, which they reached about 3 o'clock. His Royal Highness, accompanied by General Sir J. F. Burgoyne, Major-General Sir R. Airey, Major-General Eyr-, and a numerous party of officers, then proceeded t
			the extreme end of the Lines, Fort Pitt, and other points, for the purpose of Inspecting the fortifications and works of defence connected with the neighbourhood of the garrisor
			lst night his Royal Highness was to be the guest of General Eyre at Government-house.
			A serious disturbance took place on board a line-of-battle ship yesterday evening (Tuesday) at Spithead on the ques- tion of leave, and five men were sent on board the Victory us prisoners. We are unable at present to give further in- formation, bat the affair, it is reported, must terminate in a 0ourt-martlal.
			Upwards of 300 skiUed artificers and workmen were yes- terday added to the establishment of the Royal gun facto- Hes In Woolwich Arsenal. They were selected from an assembled crowd of more than double that number. and, although a greater number was required, those only were engaaed who were furnished with unexceptionable testi- mnonials for science and persevering application and industry. A numiber of foremen and leading men were also taken on, many of whom occupied subordinate posts in the department, and were promoted on accournt of the abilties and aptitude which they exhibited under examination. A second selection wll take place this morning, the total num- ber intended to be added to the already vast establishment for the purpose of accomplishing the works stipulated for the ensuing year, being upwards of 2,000 men. Mr. Anderson, resident superintendent of the establishment, has taken possession of the official quarters of the late superintendent, Colonel Eardley Wilmot, and Mr. Frazer, manager of the factories, has been granted the late offi'dol residence of Mr. Anderson, In the Royal Arsenal.
			The paddlewheel steam storeship Dee, Master Com. mnander T. Pullen, returned to Woolwlch yesterday f-om Fortamouth, and will be hauled into basin this morning to commence shipping machinery for the Prince Frederick William. The Supply will also go into basin to commence discharging returned stores from Malta.
			The new gunboat LandraU yesterday went into No. 1 dock at Woolwich to be coppered and prepared for service, and the Iron paddlewheel steamvessel Antelope was mndocked.
			The sired transport Spartan, laden with ammunition and military stores from Woolwlch, has returned to the buoy ofi Woolwich Arsenal, and has commenced discharging her cargo, in consequence of injurles sustained in late gale.
			The following ships have been chartered by the war de- partment in tho service of the military store department of Woolwich- namely, the Ellen, Clara, Anne, Pitcairne, Sharp, Glenshee, Gottenburg, and the steamers Cadiz and Brltannia. The Royalist sailed from Woolwich yesterday.
			Rear-Admiral Sir Charles H. Fremantle, K.C.B., ha5 struck his flag on board the Royal Albert, 121, Capt. Henry J. Lacon, at Plymouth, and is gone on leave of absence.
			The Pigmy paddle steamer, Master-Commander Johnson, arrived at Portsmouth yesterday morning, from Devonport, with supernumeraries, &amp;-c.
			The Siren, 16, sailing-sloop, Commander George M. Bal- four, had her masts taker. out under the sheers alongside Portsmonth dockyard yesterday. She i3 expected to pay off this day.
			The Arcana, Prussian screw frigate, Commodore Sunds- wall, Is taking in her powder, shell, and other stores at Spithead.
			The first division of the steam reserve at Portsmoath was yesterday inspected by Capt. George T. Gordon, of Her Majesty's ship Asia, and commanding the steam reserve at that port. The whole of the vessels comprised In the first division were reported in good order.
			The portion of the Channel fleet anchored at Spithead, under the command of Rear-Admiral John E. Erskine, and consisting of the Edsar, the Algiers, the Queen, the Mars, and the Mersey, has been inspected by the officials of the stesmcand shipwright departments, and their report of defects of the different ships, and the repairs recommended to be car- rIed out, h&amp;s been forwarded to the Admiralty. The whole of thefivevessels, aswe beforestated,are in need of repairs to both hul and machinery. The Mersey's required repairs in the last-named department are likely to prove of a very ex- fensive character, and necessarily involve a large outlay before she can be again pronounced fit for forei-n service. The Queen's repairs have been taken in hand by the Steam Factory Department. The Algiers, it is expected, will pro- ceed to Keyham, where she will be placed in deck to repair the defects in her stern, &amp;c. It is rrmoured that the Duke of Wellington, 131, screw, in the first-class steam reserve in Fortsmonth harbour, will be commissioned to receive the flag of the Admiral commanding the Channel Fleet, the Royal Alberts defects requiring remedy. The Duke may be prononnced fit for 1S meonths, or, perhaps, two years' ser- -vice, if worked carefully and no accident occurring; but at the end of that time she would requtre new boilers and very exterive repairs to both hull and engines. As she Ls not in a sufficiently healthy condition of hull, boilers, and engines, to be sent on a foreign station for a three yezra' c,uise, it is very probable that the rumour concerning her may be verified, and that she may carry Admiral Fremantle's llag In the Chznnel Fleet.
			RIear-Admiral Hon. Frederick Thomas Pelbam, C.B., and Bear-Admiral Sir B. Wake Walker, Bart-, K.C.B., are ex- ,eced to arrive at Portasmouth this morming from the Admn-alty.
			The Indus, 78, Capt. Hall, whlb arrived in Plymouth

			SWITZERLAYD AND SARDINIA.
			The Opinione gives the text of the despatch sent, under date of March 21, by Count Cavour to Commandatore Jocteau, the Sardinian Minister at Berne, in answer to the Swiss note
			"Turin, March 21, ISGO.
			Monsieur le Commandeur,-M. Tourte has handed me a copy of the note you will find enclosed, by which the Federal Council directs the attention of the King's Govern- ment to the juridical position of the neutralized provinces of Savoy. He cites to this end the treaty of 1564 between Savoy and Berne, and the European stipulations of 1S15.
			" On leaving with me a copy of this note M. Tourte ad- dreszed to me another, in which, referring to the proclama- tions of the Governors of Chambery and Annecy, an- nouncing an approaching general vote concerning the annexation of Savoy to France, he protests, in the name of the Federal Council, against any vote or any other act what. ever, the result of which mieht produce a change in the present state of things in Savoy. You will also find en. closed a copy of the note from the Swls3 Envoy Extra. ordinary.
			"I answered M. Tourte verbally, that I did not under- stand how the conduct observed by the King's Cabiniet in this affair could have been a cause of recrimination on the part of the Federal Council.
			" In fact, It would have been sufficient to read the an- swer which, through the medium of His Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires at Paris, I had given to the communication wherein H. Thouvenel demanded guarantees for the security of France, to convince one's-self that the King's Cabinet, unable to refuse to acknowledge the validity of a vote to be legally given by the inhabitants of Savoy, had nevertheless only made this declaratbn upon the assurances expressed In 'he notes of the French Cabinet that it would take into serious consideration the interests of Switzerland. I fur- ther observed to M. Tourte that I still less understood by what right Switzerland protested against all voting tending to show legally the wishes of the inhabitants. There Is therein a singiular forgetfulness of His Majesty's rights of sovereignty which it is rather difficult to explain, even when taking into account the international stipulations invoked bv theFederal Council.
			i' I do not, then, think it expedient to dwell on this part of the commanication made by the Helvetic Confederation, and I shall confine myself to a few remarks on the value attached by the Federal Council to the treaty of 1564 and to the transactions of 1815.
			" The Treaty of Lausanne, of October 30, 1564, between Emmanuel Filibert and the Lords of Berne, in stipulating the restoration to the House of Savoy of ' the entire lord- ship of Gex, also the part which they (the Lords of Berne) had conquered from the district of the Chablats situated beyond the L_ke and the Rhone ; also aU they had occupied of the Genevols, -a.,' declares in the 14th article that neither party shall alienate these countries to asother Power.
			" This limitation of the right of sovereignty was from its very nature transltory, and would naturally disappear with the causes that had procured its admission. It wonld cease by tlhe tait i- expressed agreement of the contracting par- tes, or else through the effect of the general stipulations that have subsequently regulated the public law of Europe.
			W Ne see, in fact, that the clause above-mentioned was In 1601 considered to be abrogated, when by the treaty of Lyons Charles Emmanuel I. ceded to France the lordship of Gex 'ith all its appurtenances, and when neither Borne nor the other confederated cantons offered any remen- etrance or protest against the use which the House of Savoy made of its right of sovereignty. horeover, two years later, the stipulations in the 14th article of that treaty of 1564 no longer appear in the convention concluded at St. Julien betw een Charles En,manucl I. and Geneva ' with the knowledge and consent' of all the Sviss cantons. Finally, In the treaty of June 5, 1754, stipulated between the Kitng Charles Emmanuel III. and Geneva, under the kindly mediation of Zurich and even Borne, it is expressly said :-' By means of the arrangements effected by this treaty and the explanatlons accompanying it all other claims of whatsoever nature they may be are herewith can- called and annuled on both sides for ever.'
			"cThe preceding considerations demoustrate most clearly that the present caims of Switzerland have no foundation. Thetreaties of 815 stilU less furnish any ground for the pretensions of the Federal Council. By these treaties the provinces of Chablais and Faucigny were restored to Sar- dinias who bad lst them in 1792.- Is there in the private treate, or in the finpl act, or in the protocols of Vienna, any arrangement or word restoring to validity the 14th
			dartle of the treaty of 15 be? A bsolutely not one.
			" But the Federal Council invokes the 23d article of the treaty of 1816 between Sardinia and Switzerland. This article is thus worded :-' The stipulations of the ancient treaties, and especially of that of June 8,17.54, such as are not expressly cancelled by the present treaty. are can- ficmed.n Can an onerin good faith believe and maintain that byon vague phrase, having no precisveImporta Sardinia could have consented to revive a stipuation datig three centuies backs? It is enough to put the question to obtain its answer. The stipulations aneuded to in S16 referred to the trade and the facilitating of communicationsbetween the two adjacent countries, and had no reference at all to the essential sights of sovereignty, which were in the same act defined expreasly as far as the neutralized provinces were concerned. For the rest, by this same phrase in the d2Sd artwle, one might have been able, perhaps, to resusci- tate the stipulations existing in 1792, but not those which by the nature of events, by the subsequent facts and con- ventions, had been cancelled for 200 years.
			"It Is, however, fair to acknowledge that the transac. tions of noI5 created for the provinces of Chablais and Fai- cigny a special juridical state relatively to Switzerland. The neutraLization of these countries was chiefly established for the sake of Sardinia, who demanded and obtained it as a compensacion for a territorial cession to Geneva, and, consequently, to the Confederation, as we have already had occasion to observe in the communications that were ex- changed Last year between the two Governments. But if Switzerland believes that this neutralization is useful to her, we do not oppose the taking of her interests Into serious considerafion. France herself had formally de- clared it, and we have registered that declaration which has become public. This point ought to be examined and settled in concert with the Powers that signed the treaties of Vienna, for it concerns the general interests of Europe quite as much as the private convenience of Sar- dlnia or Switzerland. The Kilng's Government is persuaded that the lIelvetic Confederation will be beard at the discus- sion, and, for our part, we are disposed to sunport every pro- position calculated to preserve intact the permanent interests of the Swiss nation. We have given too many proofs of our sympathy with and friendship for Switzerland, for the Fede- ral C ouncil not to he convlinced beforehaud tbatit wiU find in Sardinia, should the case require It, the sentiments that have hitherto inspired her conduct.
			" I beg you, HI. Ie Commaudeur, to read this despatch to, and leave a copy of it w;ith, the President of the Con- federation, and to a-cept, .tc., " CAVOIIR."

			TNLA-NUFActE OP LOCONOTIivES ABRO.AD.-The Engineer,inareview of the foreign locomotive and ma- chine trades, states that of the 2,624 -ngincs in use on the railways of France at the commen-,nent of 1.S58, no less than 2,521 were of French manuifactnre. At the same time 2,277 of the 2,850 locomotives in inse on the railways of C@ermany were of German manufacture, 301 only being of English make, besides 190 Belgian, 60 American, and 22 Frenct-built engines. Of the machinery employed upon the Russian railways a large portion has been made in and near St. Peteraburg, and a recent Russian order for G0 locomotives, for which a great Newcastle firn tendered, was carriedoff bythe proprietorsof a factoryinGenoa. InAnstria there is an extensive locomotive factory at Vienna. owned by the Government, and conducted by Air. J. Haswell, where every kind of railway machinery is uroduced; and a first-class locomotive can now be made in Vienna for 5001. less than a simOar engine can be sent there from Newcastle or Manchester. Another considerable factory is In opera- tiou at Weiner-Nenstadt, 29 miles south-west of Vienna. In Prussia, Borsig's factory at Berlin has turned out, since it was established, nearly 1,200 locomotives. M. Wohhlert's locomotive works, also in Berlin, produce a considerable amount of railway machinery. M. Maffei has a loco- motive factory at Herschau, near Munich. In Wurtem- berg there are some extensive works at Esslingen, where, besdes, large quantitfes of other machinery, 50 loco- motives are made yearly. Messrs. Escher, Weiss, and Co., at Zurich, are extensively engaged in the manufacture of machinery, Including locomotives. The workshops of Bel- gium, including the great factory at Serinlg, are celebrated even in England. Cail, of Paris whose works now coin- prise those fornerly carried on by Cav., has made nearly 800 locomotives; and Gonin, also of Paris, has executed a great deal of locomotive and other railway work. Messrs. Andre, Koechlin, and Co., of Mulhouse, have turned out as many as 9S locomotives in a single year. Scbneider and Co., at Creusot; Buddicom, at Rouen; Parent and Schaken, at Osiillens, near Lyons ; the Graffenstadten Company, near Strasburg, and other French makers, also manufacture loco- motives and other machinery to a very large extent.

			ATHENES OANTABRIGIB.Y'S.&amp;'
			The At7te)m Oe'7nie7ies of Antony A. Wood has now a reputation two centuries old, and yet this reputation has rather increased than diminished, as others have come after him and tested his state- ments. His vievs may have been narrow, his pre- judices inveterate, his language peculiar and occsuionally uncouth; yet his work is re- garded with reason as an appropriate monu- ment to the University of whose worthies he was the diligent historian. Through his industry and honesty it acquired this hi2h stiatus, for the exhibition of these qualities has rendered it a book 'of reference of extraordinary value to students of history. In the experience of many generations it has proved to be one of the best tools in the chest of the literary workman, who, as he derives his information from its summary out- lines, must acknowledge his reliance on their accu- racy and precision. The scholar knows Wood to be a firm staff In his own perplexities, alamp tohis feet in passages of history which are otherwise excessively dim and obscure. He has aU the comfort which men in other walks of life derive from the aid of a reli- able friend ; and still more does he learn' to value Wood when he comes to places where Wood deserts him, where, for example, he is left to his unaided quest as to any person who graduated at the sister Universitv.
			That Cambridge should have so lonaremainedwith- out an equivalent would be matter of surprise if we did not take into account the very great difficultv of supplying it satisfactorily. The author of the introduction to the second volume of Wood long ago threw out a challenge " to some good antiquary of the other University" to set to work and supply the required counterpart; and from time to time various Cambridge men have made attempts, but only attempts, to fill this literary vacuum. The in- troduction to the present work contains some account of these, and this series of incomplete efforts shows the magnitude of the task, and is curious as a con- tribution to literary history. Henry Sampson, ejected for Nonconformity from Pembroke Hall mn 1(1;2, is the first person mentioned as having made collections for this purpose. Sampson instigated Strype to labour in the same field, but Strype seems to have desired (1709) that the task should devolve on the Rev. Thomas Baker, whom he designates with justice as " that great antiquary." It may be doubted, however, whether Baker ever purposed such a work, for he appears to have contented him- self rather with the knowledge that Mr. Richardson (1735) was also collecting materials for the purpose. In fact these "g reat antiquaries" seem one and all to have hung back in dismay at the seeming magnitude of the task, and were uniformly solicitous to transfer it to some other person. Balker's MSS. exist, but, divided between Cambridge and the British aIuseum, they are not of the service they might be if arranaed in one collection. Mr.Morris Drake Morris, of Trinity (1715), next made the compilation which is nowv among the lBarleian manuscripts. Dr. Wil- liam Richardson, MIaster of Emmanuel (1736- 1775) followed in the same track, but he also fell short of completing and publishing. Then came Mr. Cole, whose Gradurati Cantairigienses were hailed by the Gentleman's Ma,azine in 1787, but who lived to record his disappointment after 30 years' labour. He regarded himself, as he states, in the light of a journeyman to Antony Wood, and could only hope that his materials would fall into the hands of a judisious brother antiquary, who would make a proper use of them when he was no more. After this series of inconclusive efforts the antiquaries of our own day lifted up their voices in lamentation for the want of such a work. Mr. Bruce, in his introduction to Hlaytcard's Annals of Elizabet/i, speaks of it as daily more and more to be deplored. So speak also the editors of the Churches of Cambridgesh ire; and, accordingly, the production of an Athenm( Cantabr7iienses was one of the projects of the Ecclesiastical Hiistory Societv previous to its dissolution, subsequent to which catastrophe the Cambridge Antiquarian Society have entertained a similar proposal, of which we conceive this work by the Messrs. Cooper to be the legitimate fruit, MIr. Charles Henry Cooper, its chief editor, being the Town-clerk of Cambridge, and the successful compiler of its annals, in four volumes, a work of research and recognized value.
			As yet the first volume only of this At8encT has appeared, including some 900 biographies pertaining to the interval from 1500 to 1585, and it is our desire to see this work completed which induces us now to notice it in its present imperfect state. These biographies include many a notable personage, such as Roger Ascham, Bucer, Dr. Butts, Coverdale, Cranmer, Thomas Cromwell, Erasmus, Fox, Gardiner, Latimer, Linacre, Cardinal Pole, &amp;c., and, as far as we can test them in a passing examination, they appear to be carefully and conscientiously executed. They are not amusing or quotable, for such is not their object. On the contrary, they are more, even than Wood's Classic Manual, a strict register of names and facts, of dates and places ; in short, a series of summary statements, of the how, the when, and the where; or, in other words, of the circumnstances which a lawyer strives to elicit from his witnesses, and which the true scholar consuxmes the midnight oil to ascertain or verify. Mr. Cooper has in this respect rather followed the ideal which NVood prescribed to himself than the practice into which he occasionally diverged; for Wood's principal object, as avowed, was to produce just such a series of Aca- demic portraits " in an honest plain English dress, without flourishes, or affectation of style, as best be- comes a history of truth and matter of fact." As in the case of Wood, also, it is not a little remarkable that this service to a University as well as to literature should be performed by a writer who is not one of her favoured alumni. As vood says, "The reader is desired to know that this Herculean labour had been more proper for a Head or Fellow of a College, or for a public Professor or officer of the most noble University to have undertaken and con- summated than the author, who never enjoyed place or office therein, or can justly say that he hath eatenthe bread of any founder." It may, indeed, under such circumstanccs, be a fair question whe- ther the University itself should not subsidize such a work out of the University chest rather than it should fail of completion from any cause here- after. We confess, indeed, to some apprehensions from the fatality which has hitherto frustrated such efforts; but it wlli be a great credit to MIr. Cooper and his publishers if he succeeds where so many have failed,-if, with or without UIniversity aid, he fills the void of which Cambridge especially has been conscious for two centuries.

			Sir,-The country will re-echo the just and foroble re- marks made by the Dake of Cambridge at the Mansion- house, tbat " the continuance of onr security mest depend very much on ourselves, and that if the volunteer move- ment is well and judiciously organized it will be found most valuable." That movement has been carried on, and the drill and exercises essential to its success have been pursued during the late severe autumn and winter with a spirit and energy above all Praise. But the period of the year has now arrived wifh returning sprlng and lengthening days when there will be greater facility for out-door drill and manceuvres, as well as for practice and firing. During the winter months there may have been some difficulty in the rural districts in finding suitable places for exercise, but at this season I hope to see military exercises and rifle practice pursued during the fine evenings with the same zest and ardour as our manly and national game of cricket, or as archery was in olden days. " Shooting with the bow," says Froude, speaking of England inthe 16th century, "became at once the drill and the amusement of the people, and every hamlet had its pair of butts, and on holydays the tilt-yard at the hall or castle was thrown open, and the young men of rank amused themselves with similar exercises."
			The country gentlemen may do good service by en. couraging the volunteer movement In their several localities and setting the example bv personal servlce ; or, where pre vented from doing so by age or infirmity, by advising and assisting to organize others.
			It wonld, indeed, be a fatal notion to suppose that any volunteer force can supersede the neceSsity of a regular army; but it may render invaluable aid In intercepting supplies, harassing the flanks and rear of an invading army, a.nd may be instructed how to throw Up field fortifications, or to turn to account the best means of defence which the nature of the country may offer.
			xt is the duty of every tree-hearted Englishman who is not enrolled In the regular army to join in the volunteer movement, if possible, in person, or otherwise by deputy or peenniary assistance. The horizon Is overcast, and we know not when the storm may burst; but if we are only duly prepared we have nothinq to apprehend, come danger from what quarter It may. Bat it Is not enough to be secure against immediate attack- Let us fix this volunteer movement on so firm and lasting a basis-letus so incorporate it with our national habits, pursuits, and amusements, that we may place even above the fear of peril our public credit, our boundless commerce, and, above all, tboso freeinsti- tutions and that constltution under which it is our pride and happlness to Ulie, and which are indeed b esings cbore aln price. Yourobedient cvant.

			The spectators had scarcely assembled on the course when the numbers of the starters (22) were displayed on the telegraph-board, Charlton being the last to weigh, and only baving just time to get down to the starting post. No delay occurred in drawing the horses together. They soon fell in, and were despatched on capital terms. They stretched in a long line, nearly side by side, across the Flat, and it was im- possible for the people at the cords, even with th ms
			powerful glasses, to distinguish which animals had the ad- vantage. On ne^Aaring the bushes the ranks began to break, and in the front were ssen Gibraltar, Atbos, Man-at- Arms, and Renmunerator, with four or five ethers close up at their heels. A second dtvision was formed, at the heai of which was Confectioner, Jason, and Mademoiselle de Chantilly, and in the extreme rear, separated from the ruck by several lengths, were Gamester, Newcastle, Simple Simon, Precursor, and Mazzint. On nearing the New Stand Confectioner bore his colours more prominently to the fore, and held a clear lead round the turn of the lands, with ManD at-Arms second, and Remunerator third. The race admits scarcely of further description, for Confectioner was never afterwards caugbt, and, his jockey being scarcely able to hold him, he swerved right across the course to the left, and won by four lengths, the second beating the third by three lengths ; Clydesodale was fourth. Cock-a.hoop, Gibraltar, Simple Simon, Flash in the Pan, and May Morning were next, scattered. The last lot comprised Mademoiselle do Chantilly, Luff, Sam Spode, and Gamester, who were beaten off.

			HIEB fATJESTFS THEA TEE.
			To every one who entdred the old Oper-house last night
			when Mr. E. T. Smith commenced hls season, the extra- ordinary beauty of the decorations which met the eye nt every turn must have been indeed surprising. Rich velvet carpets spread over staircases where once only bare stone and wood had been visible, tall mirrors constantly doubling the view, lobbies carpeted over in every direction, gilt statues placed at every available spot, rows of flower- pots ranged along walls, make up a succession of mag- nificence that at once arrests the spectator, generallyanuious to proceed with all expedition to his box or stall. The house is not only thoroughly renovated, but thoroughly changed, and the enterprising spirit of the manager is revealed before the threshold in Pall-mall is fairly crossed,
			To specify the improvements more In detail, it may be I stated that the whole of the interior has been newly painted and papered, the prevailing colours in the upper part of the house being white and gold, and those in the basement crimson and red, while in every niche are huge mirrors reaching from floor to ceiling, the large stone hall being literally lined with these costly ornaments. The grand stalrcase, reaching from the vestibule, is of itself an im- posing object, covered, as it is, with a velvet carpet, which stretches across the steps. The iron balustrade Is painted a deep mazarine blue, alternated with gold, while the hand-rails are covered with crimson velvet, set off with fringe of the same colour. On the first landing of the staircase leading from the western extremity of the stone- hail is placed a large vase, filled with aquatic flowers, from which a jet of water is springi�g, in front of a mirror.
			Nor does the aspect of the innermost part of the theatre disappoint the spectator who has passed through all these preliminary splendours. The old leather chairs have been removed from the stalls, and their place is supplied by a number of crimson satin couches, that entirely change the esneral effect.
			The season was inaugurated with Flotow's Mrarthda, and the balot of Flcur des Chamjpe. The cast of the former was tho same as at the Drury-lane Italian Opera, Mademoiselle Titlens personating the Lady Henriette, and Ginglini the farmer Lionel. Both admirably sustained their parts, the lady exulting in the full power of her fine voice; the gentleman suffering from a cold, but concealing the misfortune with al the skldl of a practised artist. Signor S. Ronconi had been expected, but did not arrive, and the eccentric Lord Tristan wnas accordingly played by Signor Castelli, while Madame Lemaire repre- sented Nancy, in lien of Mademoiselle Vaneri, originally announced. The chorus was numerous and well disci. plined, and the band, under the conduct of Signor Arditi, In every respect complete. In short, such a thoroughly satisfactory performance as that of last night angurs well for the new management of the old theatre.

The Yeo- manry Cavalry had arrangedI to have a day's exercise in a field twvo or three miles from Carlisle, and arrangements were made for the Rifle and ArtllUery Volunteers to accompany them tothe ground, andreturn in the afternoon. Aboutll1 o'clock the companies were formed into marching order, and, the word of command having been given, the Yeomianry led the way, followed by the Artillery, the R1ifles bringing up the rear. The hand of the Yeomanry played as they passed along the principal streets of the town, which were lined withi crowds of spectators, while all the available front windows were besieged by gaily-dressed ladles,who wavecltheirhandkerchiefsa%stheVolunteersppzsed. After proceeding aheut a mile out of town, accompanied by a great crowd and a long cavalcade of cabs and carriages, a heavy shower of rain fell, and it was deemed advisable to return. The Rifles and Artillery returned, but the Yeo- manry proceeded to their exerclse ground. At the Yark-et- cross the Volunteers dispersed, three cbeers having been given for the Queen andl three for the Volunteers. In the afternoon the Rifles attended Divine service at the cathe- dral, which was crammed in every part. A special sermon was reahedby te Vry ev, he eanof Carlisle.

			FRENcH A CADEMY OF Sosaxcrs.-At the last sitting a commissin was appointed, COMPosed Of M)M. Velpeau, Rayer, J. Cloquet, Andral, and Cl. Borad, for the pur- pose of awarding the Barbier prize. This will be the first time of Its beingadjudged; and as It is intended as a reward for any great discovery in surgery, medlicine, pharmacy, or maedia botany, there will be several candidates in the field; and we need only remind our readers that in the course of a few months only, hypnotism, coal tar plaster, the regenera- tion of bone, the unre of lockjaw, and santonine applied to amanrosis, have been in the field, to cenvtine them that the conflict wil be a severe one. Mi. Boutigny, in a note, en- deavoured to show that the expression commonly used of the spheroidal state of liquids was erroneous, and calculated to give a false idea of the molecular state of matter. He observes that it is by no moans necessary that a body should be in a liquid state in order to assume the spheroidal one; and that he has made chloride and nitrate of ammonia, the bichloride of mercury, camphor, iodine, stearic acid, wax, tallow, &amp;C., p m directly from the molecular to the spheroidal state.

			ROYAL ITALIAN Or3BlA.
			The season (the 14th since old Covent-garden Theatre was turned into an Italian Opera) commenced yesterday evening, with Meyerbeefs Dinorah. The choice of this genial masterpiace, taking into accountits great success last year, and the brilliant recep'ion accorded to the new singer, Madame Miolan Carvalho-who made her dr.- appearance before an English audience in the character of theheroine-was judicious; and although, asmight have been anticipated, in Easter week, when so many patrons of thq; opera are absent from London, the house was not cror,-dff'
			there was a remark-ably good attemdance. The "nWits of Dinoroa, which, both in an Italian and an ]bgllsh dress, i.s, now well known to the ELghtsh publio, have beeu aopry discussed; and It is enough here to insist upon the inar3;ed superiority of the ItaElan version-for which the composer substituted accompanied recitatives In plcao of dialogue-to the o.iginal (and its English copy), in which, the dialoguo being spoken without music, the essential attributes of comic opera are toe apparent to admit of uniform effect on so wide en arena as the Covent-garden stage.
			The performance last night,thoughinone or twolastsnces deficient, was, on the whole, the best that bas been heard in London. The orchestra could with difficulty have played its part more adimirably than before; but even in this department a closer familiarity with the somewhat in- tricate score had done its work ; and nDt only was the warm greeting awarded to Mr. Costa on taking his place at the conductor's desk fully justified by the manner in which the characteristic and splendid overture was executed, but throughont the opera a strict attention to contrasts and to the delicate gradations of light and shade be- came evident, which the several representations of 159 had not quite succeeded in attaining. As one or two extra re- hearsals would scarcely have snfficed to account for this manifest improvement, it may be referred, in some measure, to the [performances at the Royal English Opera, which commenced proceedings last autumn with the English ver- sion of Dinorah, and to the orchestra of which so many eminent members of Mr. Costa's band are attached. Tho chorus, which had little to do, in compnarison with the Im- portant labours ordinarily allotted it by Meyerbeer, In the " Ave 2iaria" behind the scenes (a novel and strikimg feature of the overture), in the evening song of the wood- cutters (Act If., expresoly written for the Italian verslon), elsewhere in less prominent situnations, acquitted itself so vwell that it seemed almost a pity there was not more set dovn in thhe way of choral music.
			The distribution of the dramatis personre differed from that of last season in two particulars of signal consequence- the change in one instance being as decidedly for the better as in the other it was for the worse. The part of Hoel, the treasure-finder and affianced husband of Dinorah, was in many respects so well sung by Signor Graziani that the audience usuaUy felt disposed to overlook the almost total want of histrionic talent in its delineation. On the present occasion, however, it was both acted and sung to per- fection. M. Faure, the original Hoel at the Op6ra Comique, is now without a rlval in his owD country as an acting, barytone. However he may have in- wardly felt constrained by the trammels of an unfamiliar tongue, he scarcely gave any Indications of it last night. He has, it is true, everytlhing in his favour-person, de- portment, voice, dramatic intelligence, expression, and fluent delivery. His voice, though French in tone and cha.
			racter, has less of the French mannerism than in the caise ot the majority of his compatriotswho from time totimohave trod the English boards ; its chief (perhaps only) drawback being an occasional tremulousness, which his sentiment, now and then slightly overdrawn, renders more prominent than might otherwise happen. But that he excels alike in various styles of expression was placed beyond a doubt; and whether In the scene where Hoel, with feigned bonhomie, wins over thetrimorous Corentinoto his ends (ActL),thatinwhich, the legend chanted by Dinoralh having opened the eyes of his unwilling dupe, he vainly tries to make him descend intc the ravine supposed to conceal the treasure (Act II.), or that where, over the body of the sleeping Dinorah, he gives utterance to repentance and despair (Act fII.)-the comic, melodramatic, and sentimental styles being thus alter- nately represented with Meyerbeer's happiest art-HL Faure was alike earnest and impressive, producing a very masked impression on the audience. He was compeled to repeat the beautiful air alluded to (" Sei vendicata assai"), which he delivered with an impassioned feeling that, but for here and there a slight tendency to excess, vwoul
			have been as irreproachably perfect as it was touching andc effective. Hr. Faure's success was complete ; and if in other parts, with which he is less intimately conversant, he can succeed in exhibiting similar exceUence, he is likely to prove
			one of the most valuable acquisitions our Italian Opera has made for many veers.
			The Dinorah of Madame Miolan Carvalho has been moro than once described ; and it is hardly requisite to do more than say, that wvhile all that was previously noted as ad- mirable in her performance, both In a vocal and dramatio sense, is retained, Increased confidence-resulting, no doubt, from a conviction that her merits are entirely appreciated- has enabled her to present even a more strlking picture than before, and to exhibit many touches of refinement which add to Its charm, while they enhance its artistic com- pleteness. At first sight the character of Dinorah seems a mere abstraction, but the genius of this truly accomplished lady makes it a thing of flesh and blood-a wayward, fitfal, capriclous, thoroughly attractive, and interesting creation, a sort of rustic Undine, in short, of whom the most adventurous Knight-errant might easily have become enamoured. Madame Miolan has also mastered the acourstic secret of the house-much vaster than her own arena in the Thdfltre Lyrique; and whereas, last season, her voice, for want of exacter calculation, was at times barely audible, it is now invariably, and under every circumstance, clear, teling, and resonant. This desirablo Improvement was at once nerceDtible in the e-nnid. 1,dlah
			("Si, carina, dorm' in pace") with which Dinorah imagines she is rocking her pet goat to sleep, every note of which was distinctly heard above the ingenious ani elaborate ac- companiments of the orchestrm. Tho duet whero sho tor- ments Corentino was playful, sparkling, and fascinatlng from end to end, and tho famous shadow-song (" Ombra leggera"), a masterpiece of brilliant and facile vocaliza
			tion. This raised the audience to positiro enthusiasm, and the last movement of the air was repeated by unani- mous desire, the applause of the audience being redoubled a'
			the conclusion. Thus a new triumph for the Italian versiom of a modern German ch1ef dXceurrc wms obtained, chiefly by the exertions of two consummate French artists. Signor Gardonl, nevertheless, as Coretino, stood up for the honour of his country, and confirmed the very favourable opinions elicited last season by his zealous, cor- rect, and effective impersonation of a part which, having smail Jntrinsic claims to sympathy, makes the task of its representative doubly arduous. IIis performance was gooc in all respects, and justiaed the marked eulogy bestowed upon it by the colobrated composer himself, after having superintended the rehearsals of Diworals, when first brought out at the Royal Italian Opera,
			Hitherto all has been " couecur dce rosc ;" but unhappily the same favourable view cannot be taken of the remainderof the performance. Mademoiselle Sylvia (a now comer) was a very inefficient substitute for Madame Nantier Dldice as principal goatherd (" coprai&amp;`'); and her nervous- nesg, the result of evident inexperience, was sadly detrimental to the beautiful air, " Fanciuloe cho il core" (Act II.), which IMeyerbeer composed ex- pressly for Mademoiselle Sylvia s predecessor. The imperEonators of the female goatherds (Mademoiselle Rtapaz- zini not making her appearance) were, we are inclined to bo- lieve, tvochoristers; oneconsequence of which was the omLs- sion of the beautiful duet (Act IIl.), " Sui prati tutt'in fior,' and the quasi-massacre of the no less beautiful patcr-nostcr ("GranDio, padre nostro"),inspite of thecommendable efforts of Signors Neri Baraldi and Tagliafico. Altogether, tho commencement of the third act (the " Eclogue") was lneffi- cientlyexecuted.SignorTagliafico was never atanytime quito at ease in the spirited " huntsman song" (" Acaccia, acaccia I' which Is always so successful In Paris; while Signor Neri Baraldi, in that of the reaper (" Gia mature son le spiche"), was far less correct than is his wont. The end, however (tbanks to Madame Miolan Carvalho and M. Faure), would have atoned for worse deficiencies; and tho lovely chorus, " Santa Maria" (ose of Meyerbeer's veritablu inspirations), bronght down the curtain amid loud ap- plause, followed by a general summons for the principal per- formers.
			After the opera the National Anthem was given, Madame Mdiolan delivering the solo verses with as much emphasis a., could reawonably be expected from a foreigner unacquainted with our language.

			CAPTE OF PRISONTERS ESCAPED F1R`OrM A GAOL.- Three men, named Presshouse, Douglas, and RavWlins, wbho were incarcerated in the Newcastle Gaol, made their escapa during the night of the 27th of October. Presshonse having been lamed in the attempt was recaptured the tame night by the chief constable, Mr. Sabbage. The other hrve re- maimed at large until the present time. On Sunday night, however, inspector Elliot and Selby Fawcett, of the detec- tive force, encountered Douglas as he was entering a public- house. From the desperate cbaracter of the man with wbhom they had to deal, to seize and pinion him was the work of a. moment; no doubt to the wstonishment of the bystanders. The necessity for this sharp pract'ce at once manifested itelf, for, seeinz the fix in which he was placed, he at once attemnsted to get his hands Into his coat pockets, but which he was prevented from accomplishing by the act of the offi- cers just mentioned. ERavine handcufed him their attention wss drawn tobhis pockets, whenfrom the outside riohthand pocketofhiscoat they tonc aloaded pistol,and from thr bresstpocket of the same garment another pistol, loaded and ready cocked. Of t.he other prisoner, rawlin, no trace haa Jet been found.

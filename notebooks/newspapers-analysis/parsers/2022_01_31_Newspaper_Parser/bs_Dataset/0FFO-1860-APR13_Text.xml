			EB ABBREST OF THE FI7E MEMBEBS %
			The attempted arrest of the five members by Charles I., though one of the turning-points in English history, has been greatly msinterpreted In many of its bearings; but 21r. Forster has fol- lowed up this sequel to the Grand Remonstrance with an alacrity wbich implies he is still in the proper track, and that he has obtainedthe means of correcting our misapprehensions. The diary of Sir Symonds D'Ewes, and the dis- coveries which hIr. Forster has made in the State Paper-offce-or rather, we should say, the corre- spondence of Pennington and others there pre- served, and now rendered accessible by the Master of the Rolls-warrant a new view of the incidents of this memorable crisis, and the announcement of this view with promptitude and emphasis. MIr. Forster could probably have presented this version with better effect if he had spared time to separate his diLquisitlons from his narrative. But, if we over- look some irregularities of form, due to excusable baste, we shall find that this is a chapter of English history re-written with good reason, or that at least the materials and inducements to write it anew, and which are here Eet forth, are of very considerable importance.
			Let us call to mind for a moment how this attempt of Charles has been represented hitherto-as the not of the King almost independently regardless of his counsellors, and, what is stiU more important, as an outburst of sudden passion, as suddenly repented of in trouble and agony, with a generous remorse and a sincere contrition. These are the statements of Clarendon, interested in the first instance to exculpate himself, concerned in the next place to gloss over the conduct of the ]King, to make light of his purpose and to separate his act from its logical complicitywith the tremendous consequences. But, if the new view be correct, Clarendon must on many points be regarded as a detected liar; while the purpose of the King was presumably known to him, with the real scope of the issue raised. Still less was that purpose a fuaitive thought; nor was the resilting act which was so fatal to Charles of less significance to English liberty, had accidents not averted its possible success. If the new view be cor- rect-andwe ourselves have little doubt that it is so mn many respects-for the first time the full logical value is assigned to an event commonly regarded as itself an accident in the struggle. The conclusion is that it was no accident, no ebullition of passion, no isolated and eccentric move, but the firm pursuit of a fixed intent, conceived with deliberation, and sus- tained afterwards with consistent obduracy; in short, that it was the designed contreoup to the Grand Remonstrance, and the formal and inevitable prelude to the return from the larger jury-panel ehortly to be asked for -ts superior verdict upon the field of Naseby.
			By the vote of the 15th of December, 1641, the Remonstrance, which was practically an appeal to the Eng,lish people as arbiters between the King and Parliament, was issued to its intended re- cipients. The attempt to seize the five members some three weeks later was Charles's deliberate in- timation of his election to pursue that appeal in the form of force. We must go back, indeed, to the King's absence in Scotland for the origin of his design to charge the five members with treason, on the special ground of their correspondence with the Scotch. There are several passages in Charles's cor- respondence at this time with Secretary Nicholas which show with what eager curiosity the doings of Lord Kimbolton also, who was afterwards included in the same indictment, were simultaneously watched. It was hardly concealed from the King's friends that the King had obtained evidence against the obnoxious members, or that he was disposed to Impeach them as suspected rebels in Eng- land, though the avowed rebels in Scotland had received a grant of oblivion and indem- nity. The King uttered threats in his letters to Nicholas which can hardly be misinterpreted upon this point. On the other hand, the members themselves, even during the debates on the Rle- monstrance, appear to have been conscious that some blow was preparing against them personally. How eagerly Pym met Waller's chaUenge of his loyalty, and forced the House to a specific declaration in his behalf I The King had not been five days in London, after his arrival from Scotland, before Pym had oc- casion to ask from his place whether it did not become the representatives of the people to take Eerious note of the many signs around them of a con- spiracy by some members of the Commons' House to accuse other members of treason. On the 20th of December, when the minority against the Re- mnonstrance claimed the right of protest, it was sug- gested in their behalf that otherwise they might be involved with the majority and "' lose their heads in the erowd." Such alarms, in short, were gene- rally prevalent. The King had " a confident and severe look," arcording to the authentic D'Ewes; and, " not deigning to receive the obeisanee of honourablemembers, passedout through the midst of them," says the lHarleian MS. In accordance with the tone of his followers in the Re- monstrance debates, he was about, moreover, to en- large the scope of his accusation so as to include the conduct of the obno=ious members even in their Parliamentary capacity; in short, both parties knew, though not to the same extent, that a fur- ther issue was pending, and would be shortly dis- closed, and that this Issue might be a death- struggle for one of the two parties.
			Tne rung, on nis siLe, nad. received some en- courag:ements since his return from Scotland, and these had great influence in impeling him to his fatal process. Was there not a Royalist party ap- parently growing up in the city itself ? Was he not entertained there by a Royalist Lord Mlayor on the
			very day of his arrival, when his reception was truly I magnificent, and aU things looked " stately and veil?" Captain Slingsby wrote hopefuly to Ad- miral Pernington-the Admiral being, aswe infer, in the Downs-that he observed a very great alteration of the affections of the city from what they had been when he went away. The whole crisis turned on the conduct of the city at this conjuncture; and their banquet to the King, according to Mr. Thomas
			Wiseman, was a reception and glorification of so' much worth that Eis MAIajesty, in his graciousness, knighted the Lord lMayor and Rlecorder, and the day after made the former a baronet.
			Another false reed and tricky ignis fat-us ap- peared in the shape of a letter from MIr. Speaker Lenthal. Lenthal was a poor pretender, unequal to his post, sustained there by the tolerance of the House of Commons, and frequently set straight by the indefatigable D'Ewes. Hfe had not yet de- scended to the depth of baseness at which he could give evidence against Scot, the regicide, of words which he had heard while sitting in the Speaker's chair. A noble inspiration, so superior to the man, seized and possessed him a fortnight from this date, that we are warranted in conceiving that the Genius of the Constitution caught poor Lenthal sittina aU unconscious on the tripod, and breathed through him a blast as potent as the Delphic oracle. But at this date he was alarmed by the debates on the Grand Remonstrance, and he simply obeyed the impulse of his narrow, timorous nature by writing to the Se- cretary of State for leave to quit his post. So con- fidently did he anticipate the King's speedy victory that, in continuing to remain in the chair of the Rouse of Commons, he could see only utter failure to his life, the ruin of his estate, and poverty to his children. Accordingly he prayed to be relieved from his too onerous dignity, and to become once more the meanest subject of a Sovereign whom he professed to regard with an abject veneration.
			To the King-willing and even eager to be duped, and exulting in the belief that he had at last won all-powerful friends in the city-here was ground for belief that even in the House of Commons his enemies themselves were falling asunder. But Captain Slingsby nevertheless saw grounds for suspecting that " sinco the King's coming aU thinges have not happened so much to his content- ment as by his magnificent entertainment att his entrance was expected." In truth, "the factions citizens begin to come again to the Houses with their swordes by their sides, hundreds in companies; their pretences only nst episcopacie' And before a week was over, the captain had observed that whereas this "soUzcitation of the Parliament" had proceeded in the first instance only from the ruder sort of people, now it was certain that "some of the better sort of the same faction came in good num- bers to the Bouse, accoutred in the best manner they could, and in coaches, to prevent the aspersion that was layed upon them that they were of the baser sort of people only which were that way affected." These superior agitators came not only to petition against Popish lords and bishops, but to complain of the Lord in whom Charles trusted (in this instance the Lord Mayor) that he was raising
			Arrest cf the Fire Afenrners by Charca I. x Chapter of ZnDZisi^rZ/P.c.wxeAn. ByJchnForesr. 2=3ry,1S60,
			armed men against them in the city. Even Lenthal shrank back into his Speaker'i sholl, and talked no more of slinking from his difficulty, while the Under-Secretary (Bere) wrote to the AdMsral (Pen- nington) in the Dowm3, "I pray God we find not that we have flattered ourselves with an imaginary strength and partie in the citty andelsewhere, which will fall away if need should, be."
			Charles himself continued toWact as if this imagi- nary strength harlbeen solid and eternal ; for Charles was the dupe of a temperament sanguine even in the contemplation of treachery. He deliberately removed the trainbandt3 on guard at the two Houses, and substituted companies officered by himself. He put forth an order particularly offensive to the Opposition on the subject of religious worship. He recast the offices at Court, notoriously that he might invite into his councils the leading opponents of the Grand Remonstrance, or it might be with othes hope3 in that direction, secret as yet, or inown tc Pypm aloG. He assailed the privileges of the Com- mons in a vital point, by an intemperate message of disapproval during their discussion of a Bil
			for raising soldiers by impressment. He issued, on the very day after the citizens presented their petition against the Bishops, a proclamation commanding the severe execution of the statutew against all who should bring in question or impugn the Book of Common Prayer. And while thus harsh in pressing, on the one hand, the law against Puri- tan opponents of the Establishment, he respited ite operation, on the other hand, in favour of certain Romish priests, who had fallen under santence of the Courts, and whose lives lay forfeit to a rigorous law. It was hardly conceived possible that, after a reprieve bad been sentto these Jesuit offenders, their fellow prisoners, condemned for offences then held to be comparatively venial, would be actualy exe- cuted. But an order for the execution neverthelese came, and the agitation throughout the citv was excessive. Arms were secretly conveyed into Neo- gate; open resistance was attempted; but the wealthier citizens discountenancing this extreme measure, on the 14th of December the condemned religionists were banged. This last incident left in the breast of all classes a rankling sense of san- guinary maiice, at which even the starch mieht have fled from Elizabeth's collars, and bluff Hal hun- self have experienced a twinge of apprehension. Charles, however, made a further effort-viz., t'
			substitute Lunfford, an admitted ruffian, for the then Governor of the Tower, and thus to get his hand on the " bridle" of the city ; with the view also, accord- ing to Warburton, " to keep the five members safe whom it was determined to arrest ;" but a vote of the Commons, and the attitude of the people, here appear to have checked him. Between the 24th and 29th of December the aspect of affairs had grown serious, the citizens gathered together in large numbers with menacing looks, and Charles for a moment seems to have wavered on the eve of the most desperate resolution of his life.
			The course he took, if Sir Edward Dering's state. ment can be relied on, was so extraordinary, and it has been hitherto so little suspected, that MIr. Forster is right, if it be indzibitabZy a fact, in treat- ing it as quite an historic revelation. Charles, it is said, with a high audacity which savours of true Kfingeraft, of the subtlest prudence, or the clearest magnanimity, made secret overtures to his great .opponent, Pym.
			It is beyond all question, though we are hardly in the habit of realizing his pre-eminence in this sense, that Pym was at this time the most popular man in England. The attempts made, or said to have been made, upon his life dnring the debates on the Re- monstrance had raised him even higher than during the memorable conflict with Strafford. It was not merely that he was the foremost man in the Parlia- ment by which so much had been achieved for the people, but that he alone of those who were in the front rank also represented in his person the Parliaments of former years, and those usages and precedents, become since the very bulwarks of freedom, which had only thenbeen won by the hard and desperate endurance, the long imprisonments, not seldom the deaths, of the great men of the p&gt;ast. In him the people still saw the Cokes, with their venerable precedents, the Elliotts, with their tristful bondage, the Sir Robert Cottons, with the petty but harsh vexations-of their lettered ease. Hie had himself been the inmate of a State prison, as the reward for his conduct as a re-
			jrensenai-ve o0 rae people, now nearly elght-and- twenty years ago. He had been a leading member in that patriotic assembly which met in 1620, and abolished the infamous monopolies at that time eat- ing out tho heart of the kingdom. He was one of the 12 who carried their famous declaration to King James at Newmarket, when the crabbed old pedant called out for " Chaiis, chairs! herc be twal kyages comin P' In all the subsequent Parliaments of that and the succeeding reign he had played a dis- tinguished part; and when, after intermission of those conventions for 12 years, they met once more in April, 1640, and men gazed upon each other looking who should begin (much the greater part, as Clarendon says, having never before sat in Parlia- ment), there presently rose to his place at their head the man abovo all others qualified by ex- perience, by eloquence, and by courage to lead them to the goal of freedom. It was then that Pym's superior influence struck root, and his name became a word familiar over England. It was he who, in that brief Parliament, so foolishly dissolved, had told the story of their aggravated wrongs, the summary which was its sole bequest to suffering millions. It was he chiefly who had wrested from the Court its assent to the greater and stronger Parliament from which at last redresswasto come. It was he who, on the issue of the writs for that memo- rable assembly, had, vith Hampden, ridden England through to urge upon aU its inhabitants their duties and theirright,to choose honestly and petitionfreely. Finally, itwas he who had subsequently broken down for ever the " thorough" tyranny of Strafford and of Laud, and who now had published to the world the Great Remonstrance. In the impeachment of the greater criminal he had summed up the pending issue in a metaphor wVhich rings in our ears to this day,-" Shall it be treason to embase the King's coyne, though but n piece of twelvepence or six- pence, and must it not needs be the effect of a greater treason to embase the spirits of his subjects, and to set a stamp and character of servitude upon them, whereby they sall be disabled to do anything for the service of the King or Commonwealth?' Can we wonder if every nook and corner of the kingdom was pervac'ed with his history and in- fluence, and that on him, sO identifiedwith the past, it might almost seem3 exclusively to rest what the future was to bring'! "I think Mr. Pym was at this time," says Clarendon, " the most popular man, and the 3most able to do hurt} that hath lived in any time."
			Already the King had turned to him in his former extremity, when a schleme was on foot to save the life of Strafford, and then he had offered Pym the Chancellorship of the Exchequer. Clarendon inti- mates that he could not accept it at the price of saving Strafford, and regrets the failure of the King's proposal as losiing him some able services. But that the offer of the same office should be re- newed at this moment, when the King had what he afterwards alleged to be proofs of Pym's treason in his hand, and that Pym alone should receive such an order, would be indeed surprising, if it were thoroughly certified vwith anything like detaiL At all events, there is this ground for sustainiDg the statement, that Pym, in poDular belief, and probably in that of Charles, possessed the power of a Sovereign, and as such might be expected to receive overtures of peace. The Royalist song writers designated him "'King Pym-;" their gibes often implied his
			lose relations withCharles himself; in Henrietta's correspondence his name again and again occurs; and the feeling of Charles towards his great antagonist appears, like hers, to have strangely fluctuated between desire and dlead. It may, therefore, have been the fact-that Is to say, it is just possible-that the offer, on which Mr. Forster insists so strongly, was made, though P&gt;m himself never made the re- motest allusion to it. Sir Edward Dering, at all events, did inform Iady Dering that the King, within two hours of his making Culpepper Chan- cellor of the Exchequer, " had sente a messenger to bring Pym unto him, and wold htave given himz that place." It is donbtful whether he means to say the place was offered and declined, and it does not appear that he even avers that any interview took place. Culpepper, it is true, was his fellow-member for Kent; but it is suspicious that Dering, no consider- able conjuror, should know and divulge that on which Clarendon and others are silent. Ir. Forster accepts the fact as established by his testimony; and though, in our opinion, it is pecu- liarly open to dispute, instead of being, as he assumes it, " indisputable," we can agree with him as to dates and incidents, that it occurred, if it did occur. within the limits of the last haf of Decem.
			ber, amid a number of other official changes. Tfhese were the days in which Windebank fied, in which old Vane was turned finally adrift, in which young Vane was ordered suddenly to send in his accounts as Treasmrer of the Navy; and Pym, who welcomed ole Vane into the popular ranks, was at that time, lkc Hampden, ranked p arith Hollis as uncommitted to extreme courses. Perhaps he never became so
			"root and branch" as Hampden, even in the hour of their greatest exasperation, and at this time perfidy had not made its spring, and both, for their necessary protection, had thrown away their scab- bards.
			If the offer was, indeed, made to Pym it was prudently rejected, for It had long been clear that nobody could trust the Stuart. Theappointment of Lunfford to the Tower had justly alarmed the people, and, tumults arising, this appointment was cancelled. In these tumults tho citizens had first seen the animus of the King's adherents in the form of actual bloodshed, for on the 27th of December several citzens were wounded and Sir Richard Wise-
			man slain. A number of Prentices coming with a* petition to the House had roughly handled the Archbishop of York, tearing his gown from his back, while they mobbed Colonel Lunfford, pro- bably in ignorance that his appointment had been revoked. On their retuun these petitioners had to pass the gate at Whitehall, then held in force by a band of dissolute bravoes, whom the King had drawn together for his personal defence. Appa- rently the citizens were unarmed, but, as they taunted the guard, the latter rushed out from WhitehaU and attacked them, when "some few," according to Clarendon, " received some cuts and slashes." Possibly the whole affair was an accident, due principally to the circumstance that the Whitehall gate lay inopportunely in the way, but the result was that the HJouses regarded the in- cident as a levying of war by the King, and were alarmed, or, at least, exceedingly irritated.
			On the next day there were long silences in the House, noted by D'iEwes, for the shadow of events of which no man could forecast the course or see the end had by this time faUen upon the most voluble debaters. Some resolute men kept their courage and resolves unshaken, and among them Mr. Oliver Cromwell, who addressed the House then and the day following on the proper puosture and offi- cering of the army. Stragglers came to the bar of the House to give evidence of the threats they had heard in the recent "hurlyburlys." WVarn- ings came also from Whitehall, from the very centre of the French circle of plotters and priests who served Henrietta or her French connexion. A Frenchman named Fleury informed Captain Langres that great troubles were hatching, and Marston, the dramatist, an inmate of the Gatehouse prison, to which recusant priests were incessantly committed, wrote earnestly to Lord Kimbolton to warn him of his special danger the day before the attempt at arrest took place. We gather from D'Ewes that there are grounds for be- lieving that Pym knew of the intention to impeach him four days before it has been commonly asserted to have entered the mind of the King. Both the tumults and the reprisals at Whitehall gate were in. significant Incidents of the attempt either contem- plated or then in preparation.
			The peril was accelerated by the injudicious pro- test of the bishops on the 30th of December, which even Slingsby thinks was " done too soon," and to which the Commons "in half an hour" retorted by impeaching its authors. MIr. Forster infers that this protest was prompted by the King or his ad- visers to effect " an overthrow of all Acts passed ;" but by 8 o'clock that winter's night the recoil of the blow had lodged 10 out of the 12 pre- lates in the Tower, the two others being com- mitted to the Black Rod by reason of their great age. York and Canterbury, Williams and Laud, the inveterate rivals, were now inmates of the same pri- son, and Heylin intimates that the latter indulged in a chuckle of satisfaction at their unexpected companionship in misfortune. It was, perhaps, the last ray of mirth which glimmered on that stanch obstructive between the gloom of Stralbrd's scaffold and his own. As to D'Ewes, he saw the self- pronounced exclusion of the bishops without emotion, and recorded it with peculiar dryness. Looking in at the Upper House, he says, " There was but a thin House of Lords, and on the right eide thereof a great emptiness, the two -formis upon
			whtch Ute bi.sliops used to sit boiwj t1crust utp close to the wall." The non-combatants had, as it were, been removed out of the way of tho expected " hurly- burly," which D'Ewes was instructed of more clearly when he got back to the Commons. There he found Pym with unusual gravity and seriousness moving that the doors be closed, and the Speaker desiring that nobody who went into the Committee Chamber should speak to 'anybody out of the window, or throw ouct to them any paper writing. Pym had something to move, which proceeded from some knowledge on his part of the attempt so soon to be made; but he spoke under obvious re- straint, though moving the House to invite a guard of citizens to their protection without another day's delay. So vaguely did he ma'ke his announcement that there was a plot for destroying the House of Commons, that D'Ewes answered, if the suspicions were merely general, he saw no sufficient reason for the course proposed; on the other hand, if Mr. Pym had moro certain grounds for the causes of fear alleged, he knew of no such present preventive as that " we should adjourn ourselves till three of the clack, that so we may not be all taken togethecr." Pym made no reply to this appeal, probably because he would rnot compromise his informant, and, as D'Ewes'srecord is incomplete, the result of the debate is not certified.
			But apparently it was resolved to make a renewed appeal to the King; for on Friday, the 31st of O0e- comber, Denzil Hollis delivered to him a verbal re- quest for a guard out of the city, under command of the Earl of Essex. The King required this demand in writing, and deferred his reply until the following Monday. In the meantime Falkland and Culpepper were sworm into their offices, and on Mlonday came the answer by which a guard was refused. Moreover, while the King's message promised, with what must have sounded as con- temptuous irony, that he would be himself their protector, his arm was stretched out in another sense. At this moment the Attorney-Generalwas delivering at the Clerk's table of the Upper House another message, accusing the five members of the Commons, with Lord Kinbolton, of treason, upon seven grounds, of which the authorship of the remon- strance and their communications with the Scottish rebels were two of the most specific, while the sixth and seventh accused them of raisirg and counte- nancing tumults, and by their demand of a guard of conspiring to levy, and of actuaUy having levied, war against the King.
			Whilethe articles were being publicly read, the trouble aud agitation were extreme, and, as Claren- don says, their lordships were " appalled." Never- theless, they waived the King's requirement, urged through the Attorney-General for immediate pos- session of the persons of the accused, and at once raised the qaestionof the regularityofthe accusation, referring it to a committee to produce precedents and records. And whereas on the previous day they had declined the urgent instance of the Comnrions to join with them in demanding a guard under an offi- cer of their own selection, they now intimated their readiness to join in that demand. Thus the Lords themselves mistrusted His Majesty's protection, and on the seventh and last ground of the impeachment were prepared to range themselves in the same category as the accused. Then Lord Eimbolton rose, and, indiguantly repelling the charge, chal- lenged inquiry; while Lord Digby, sitting at his side, and who was to have moved his commitment, quailed at the resolute aspect of the House. Though he, if any man, was implicated in the councils from which this attempt had emanated, he affected surprise, assured Lord Kimbolton that the King was mnischievously advised, and, professing a desire tol interpose and prevent mischief, rapidly quitted the House.
			In the meantime the Lower House was moved unwontedly by the presence of groups of officers and others scattered about here and there in the lobbies and outside passages, in a manner not usual - while one or two sentences traceable in D'Ewes'snote book show the tone in which Pym was speaking
			" The great Council of the kingdom should sit as a free council.... No force about them without con- sent ..... Not only a guard of soldiers, but many officers in Whitehall.... Divers desperate andloose persons are listed and combined together under pretext to do Hlis ajesty's service," &amp;c. Pym mloved and carried a suggestion to the authorities of the city that they would permit companies of trained bands to attend as a guard upon the Houses at Westminster, and that they would set strong defences and watches about the city streets and walls. Some debate followed on the conduct of
			Digby and his father, when Pym and Denzil Holis were called to the door by urgent messages from their servants to tellthem that their trunks, studies, and chambers, and also those of Mr. Hlampden, were sealed up by some one sent from HisMajesty. This the Efouse proceeded to declare a breach of privi- lege and a violation of the common law, and to which they authorized resistance, neither Lord Falkland nor Calpepper, who were present, oppos- iug the motion. Then camo the further alarm that lWr. Francis, the King'sSerjeant-at-Arms, wvas at the door, having command to deliver a message demandin,g the five accused. Mr. Francis was not permittedcto enter until he had laid aside his mace, and then he was directed to wait outside the door until the pleasure of the House should be commu- nicated to him. Mr. Francis, aswe findafterwards, remained in the lobby while an answer was framed, as he was subsequently instructed, to be borne by members of the Commons House. This answer in- formed the King that the accused would meet any legal charge, while they were directed for this purpose to attend ia their places de die in dient. Pym's mo- tion for a guard from the city was turned into an order of the House; the Sergeant-at-Arms was em- powered to break the seals on the papers of the accused, and warrants were issued against the agents in their illegal seizure. All this business was transacted, and the January day had declined, before poor Mlr. Francis, in the passage, was told he might kick his heels no longer. Before midnight all these proceedings wvere in print,andclirculating in the city soon after the King had received the committee who bore the message of the Commons. This com- mittee consisted of Fall,land, Culpepper, Stapleton, and Hotham; but Charles, addressing himself solely to Falkland, said that the House should have his reply as soon as it assembled the following morn- mg".
			WVhether Charles really intended to senu any such reply depends on the truth of an anecdote which represents him as yielding to the subsequent instiga- tion of the Queen to go to the House himself, and fetch out the five members. It runs on the authority of Sir William Coke that the Queen the following morning was violent in her incentives, exclaimning,
			1Allez, poltron! Go, pul these rogues out by the ears, ouw ne me revoyez jamais." Mr. Forster thinks he sees the indications of a more deliberate proce- dure (conceived and perhaps counselled overnight) in the following significant circumstances. Charles sent that very night to obtain assistance from the Inns of Court. To meet the Commons' request for a guard out of the Train Bands, he sent also that night a counter warrant to the Lord MIayor, not only to refuse the Commons the guard they had desired, but, in its place, to enrol such a guard for the Royal service, and to authorize him to fire with loaded bulets on persons assembling for any other purpose. But the clocks at Vhitehall kept the time of a dynasty behind the age; they were considerably late, so that his messenger, Mr. Latche, found the chief magistrate in bed, and that Yen and Pennington had been beforehand with himn. Tus Latche reported in a letter which is ex- tant to Mlr. Secretary Nicholas. Mr. Forster even seems to infer from Clarendon's form of objection to the deed attempted subsequently, that he only "detested" it after it had failed, and that he and his friends (we presume Mr. Forster includes Falk- land) may have been its direct counsellors, though their names were withheld by the King, an pro- tection to his chief adherents.
			Could we reject the counter evidence altogether, this latter point must remain in doubt; or rather, we should say, the evidence preponderates to the contrary. It is not so absolutefy dear, even, that the King distinctly contemplated on the night be- fore, that he himself should proceed to the Houses on the following morning. One incident, however, is certain ; the attempt was onlyzrendered desperate either by the premature boasting of the Queen, or the incautiousness of Charles himself, in the preDsenbce of Lady Carlisle. Awoman spoilt all. Lady Carlisle, who had been the friend of Stratford, was now the friend of Pym, having transferred her allegiance, by an intefligiblo preference, from Stratford's deceivers to his open enemies. That there was any further intrigue, such as Royalist writers implied, is hardly to be regarded as probable; but the function of Lady Carlisle as a spy of the Opposition was at this time unequivocal. It was doutless she who from time to time imparted informationto Pym which he could not repeat, but the reflection of which is seen in his speeches and motions. Madame de MotteviUe says that the Queen, mistaking the hour, boasted in Lady Carlisle's presence that the King was now master in 'is States, and that Pym and his con- federates were in custody. But she had told the triumph of her hate too early to prevent Lady Carlisle from makling it the triumph of her own. " Accordingly, within an hour from that time," adds Mladame de Motteville, " Pym knew what was to be done that dav."
			It was early in the moroing of that same day when D'Ewes entered the House ; but Lord Falk- land had already reported the King's reply to its message of tho preceding night, to the effect that he would send an answer before the House was set. Then followed a debate on the information that the King had been tampering with the Inns of Court, and a counter move in that direction. Four mem- bers, who were also members of the inns, were de- spatched to their respective societies on the instant. Then, pursuant to an order of the previous slay, the HOUEC resolved itself into a grand committee, and Pymand his fellowaccusedrose insuccessionto defend themselves from the charges of treason. Hampden spoke last and with a marked emotion, so much so that Sir Philip Warwick tells us the scurf commonly on his face showed plainly enough that beneath the quiet and seemingly passionless self-control, which he was able ordinarily to assume, lay a very sharp and acrimonious temper of the blood. Clarendon also remarks the change in his manner, and in that of Pym. Whereas he ascribes to Hampden a pereuasive courtesy of demeanour, and an absolute faculty of self-governance which made him a master of men, he remarks that his nature and carriage now eeemed much fiercer than before. Yet he also speaks of a composedness appearing during the events of this remarkable day in the countenances of many who used to be disturbed at less surprising occur- rences; and the proceedings at least show that the House itself was undaunted. The House desired a conference with the Lords on the subject of the im- peachmaent, which they denounced as a scandalous paper, and to call attention to the Whitehall guard as an interruption to free debate. It was soon re- ported that this guard had swelled into " a great confluence of armed men," that, 30 or 40 cannoniers had gone into the Tower last night, and that arms were distributed to some men in preference to others. A deputation was therefore sent to confer with the MIayor and Common-Council in such haste that Mr. Peard " was sent after them, to require them to let no man know their errand till they came into the city." It was proposed also to make some inquiries at Whitehall, whereupon the House adjourned at 12 o'clock for one hour, during which hour, reserved for dinner, Lady Carlisle's message reached Pym, and a further communication came from the Lord Essex with advice to the five members to absent them- selves.
			Tho House returned to receive reports from the Inns of Court and from lZathaniel Fiennes as to the armed crowds gathering at WhitehalL And then, on communication of the secret intelligence just re- ceived, the five members being still present, there followed a debate brief and pressing-should the accused retire or wait the King's arrival? Pym, Hollis, and Hampden appear to have been for quit- ting the House, Haselrig and Strode for remaining, when a new actor appeared in the person of Captain Langres, who had clambered over the roofs from Whitehal. Captain Langres called out Fiennes, who immediately communicated with the Speaker; upon whichLenthal rose, and abruptly told the H3ouse that the King had already left Whitehall at the head of a large company of armed men, and was approach- ing W'estminster. This dosed the debate. W7hereas the motion had been, that the members be com- matided, an amendment was carried, that they hare leavr to absent themselves, and, as Hasalrig says, " Away we went. The King immediately came in, and was in the House before we got to the water." Strode, still resisting, was dragged out by a friend, and the King entered the lobby with his band of armed partisans.
			It turns on the number and arms of these latter whether a violent seizure was reasonably appre- hended, and the facts fairly sanctioned the antid- p3.ton of a bloody scene. The armed-men who ac- companied the King must have been about 500. Sir flalph Verney states that, beside his usual guard and his pensioners, His Majesty was attended by 200 or 300 soldiers and gentlemen. Rushworth, Ludlow, May, Mrs. Hutchinson, and D'Ewes agree to this in substance Captain Stingby, after descrb- in-a the crowds which had recently ilocked to
			NVhitehall, says the King went wdih themn alZ on that Fanuary afternoon. They were " srm'dwith awords nd pistolls," and their passage struck such terror hat the shops in and about the Hall were closed, nstantly shut up by their tenants, who looked, says D'Ewes, " for nothing but bloodshed and desola- ion." Having reached the gate the armed band mddenly formed a lane, rangig themselves on dIther side along the whole length of the Hall and Nbarles, passing through this line, ascended the stairs :o the Commons' House, as many as could press into ,he lobby crowding after him. Captain Slingsby, who was one of these, says the King charged them so come no further, and "himselfe, with a small ,rayne. went into the House of Commons, where aever King w as (as they say) but once-King Henry Dhe Eighth."
			We may imagine the suspense of that moment 3ven among those resolute hearts. Air. Speaker had just received instructions to sit still, with the mace lying before him, when a loud ]nocldng was heard, then a rush of armed men, and, above ill, the voice of the King, commanding, "Upon their ives not to come in." The moment after Charles antered, with the Elector Palatine, while the door was kept open, leaving visible a party, of whom "some had left their cloaks in the heal," while "most of them were armed vwith pistols and 3words." As the King entered all the members rose and uncovered, the King also removing his hat ; and Rushworth observes that had the hve members been present it would have been difficult to discern them among that crowd of bare faces. But there was one face among the five which Charles Imew too well not to have singled it out even there, and it was remarked that his glance and his step were turned in the direction whero Pym's seat should have been, close by the bar. " His Majesty, not seeing MIr. Pym," pro- ceeded up the House, and D'Eves, mentioning the mutual bowing,, describes the scene which Is now familiar. Charles himself, corrected the speech which Rushworth reports him to have made, and altered the phrase mny into " tho birds are flowen." Lenthal, appealed to by the King, uttered his one breath of discreet patriotism and then subsided. Then His Majesty, baffled, but threatening other courses, went out of the House, as D'Ewes observes, " in a more discontented and angry passion than he came in," the cries of " Pri- vilege, privilege," ringing in his ears. D'Ewes re- cords the expressions of disappointment from the swordsmen in the lobby, and expresses his sense of the critical hazard and narrowness of the doliver- ance. Furthermore he set his own house in order, " having ever since the 4th day of January last past left 7tis wiil with a third person in trust." MIen of peace felt for their lives in this great jeopardy. But for the moment the Stuart had made his spring and missed his prey. There were stil, as Ar. Secretary Bere wrote to Admiral Pennington, worse dangers ahead; but the ac- cused were for the moment safe. The House pre- sently rose, and the members discussed "the ex- treme danger they had escaped through God's won- derful providence ," while Charles went back with his unfieshed swordsmen to relate his miscarriage, and to account to his Queen why he was not yet wnastcr in his Sttes in the sense he contemplated.

			THlE BRUTAL MIURDER AT PmnraTir.-On Wed- needay morningThomas Sowerby, alias "Tommy Grey," was brought before Colonel Harrison and T:r. Joseph Salkeld, at thePenrith Police-office, upon thecharge of the wilful murder of a German whose name is supposed to be Simon Manassa, a gardener by trade, whose assassination, on Monday ni-ht or Tuesday, was briefly recorded in The Times of yesterday. MSr. Carson, superintendent af the connty police force, was the only witness examined. He said that from informa- tion he bad received on Tuesday morning he proceeded to a field at the end of Gilwilly-lane, in the outskirts of the town of Penrith. He found she decemaed lyin- in a corner of the field on his right side, with his right arm%elow it and face dowsswards. The head was cut in several plaoes, and the face end nearly tne whole of the body were covered with blood. The whole of his clothes were com- pletely saturated with water. His pockeets did not seem to he at all disturbed. The man was then quite, dead, but the body was fresh and limp. Witness described the articles which he found in the po ckets of the deceased, which in- eluded 2s., after the body had been removedI to the work- house. On carefully searching the locaity in which the de- ceased was found, he found near it an oak walkinostick with a great deal of blood and some hair upon it, and also picked up a piece of an ash sapling completely saturated with
			lood,lth a great many hairsupon it. In an adjoining field ho found a corresponding picae of ash sapling, which was also bloody. He found this about 70 yards from where the body was found, and about two yards from a hog-house which stands in a corner of the field. There is a door openlog into the log-houeo from tho oloughed field in which the body was found but It was fatened; and there is another doorway leadiing into the hog- house from the pasture field, whiob had no door upon It. Withness had had complaints made to him ahot tra.ps sleeping in that ho"-hoese, but he never saw any. Some straw in the loft above had evi- dentlv been recntly0 slnt -oo +1 --
			after investigating the case, ho found ho haa gonei to Pat: terdale. Witness folloved him thither, and apprehended him in the tap-reet at Gelderd's hotel. On bhing told by witness that he WaS suspeoted of kiUling the deceased, the prisoner said, "I did not do it I never saw the man after he left the publichor,se, and i stayed an home after he went oat." Before taoing him into custody witness told the prisoner he wouldthave to go hack with him on that charge. The prisoner repldied, " I don't care; y ou will have to keep me, and I can hardly do that by work- ing from daylight till dark." On arriving at the police- etation wtnesssearched the prisoner, who was wearing a light linen jacket. On that jacket ho found several spots of blood. Thereerere maks both inside and outsilde the wrist, and alsoon thesleeve of the coat. On beang gut into the ceU the prisoner said, "tThey can nobbue hadng me, and I have no one to fret after me." In a stable occupied by Mr. syetheriigten, of nenrith (by w hom the prisoner was employed as a sort of cattle-herd), where the prisoner had been seen early on Tuesday morning, witness fonnd a legging; and in a cart in the yard was found a pair of leggings which were spattered with blood. They were covered with blood and dirt. (The articles of
			lothing marked with blood were prodnced, and examined by the magistrates.) WJiness said that the cart in which he had foand the leggings was one of those which h6d been at Patterdale, hut he could not say whether it was one of those which the prisoner had or not. Only ed. WaS founnd on the prisoner. The prlsoner was remanded for a week. In the afternoon the inquest on the body of the deceased was opened before Mr. Carrick, the coroner, and a respestable jury. Joseph Pichardson, a porter, who had been going to feed a horse about 6 o'clock on Tuesday morning, in a fiell nearto where the deceased WfS found, deposed that in the meadow he found a iallning. stickmarkednwithlood,and,srspetinagsomethingswaswrong ho stopped and looked about. h.e sew the deceased lying in a recess beside a gate in a stone wal. Life was in him then, bat the man did not speak. Ashwwaa crossing theameadowhe had observed a man, whom he knew by sight as a servant of Mr.Hetherington's, in thessame fided as himsef, coming trom the direction of Peenith. When henegt aw this man he was returning towards P'enrith. In answertohiscaUlsthis man came up. Witness told him there weeas somebody lying there. The mAn answered that he had to meet some horses and was in a shurry. Witness spoke to the deceased, and asked him what he was doing there. Ho appeared to hear and moved his head. WhUie the man stood at the gate, he said that just before witness had called him he had come up 4o shut the gate and had seen the man Iying there, hut had not spoken to him. Witness did not see any blood abort the body. A 1 was covered with " rime." He let the stick bsaide the deceased. They left, the man Pgreeing to go and telthe polce. After theyparted, witness went into the town and gave in ormation to the polnce, thinkang the man might not do sO. Superintendent Carson repeated the evl. deunce which ho gave before the magistrates, as given above. Medical testimony was adduced as to tho nature of t.he w,ounds. Several wounds on the head pene- trated the sealp, so that the hone could be felt in many places. It was determined that the clothes masked with blood should he cent to London, that the spots might be analysed, and the inquest was adjourned till the 26th of ApriL. The Chief Constable, h�r. Dane said it could be proved chat the prisoner and the deceases went arm-in-arm on hEondaynight inthe diraction of the place where the body was found, and also that the prisoner took his leggings off at Patterdale the following morning. The deceased had stated in a pabliohonso that he had money-a note and some sovereigns. The appearance of the irond where the man was found indicated that a strugglo had taken place lose to a brook which runs by. It was supposed by the polleethat the man was 3murdered olose to the stream and afterwards thrown In, bbut that he had afterwards recovered himself and crawled to where he was found.

			R.LIGIOUS LIBERTY IN TED NRW
			ITALIAN KI NGDOA.
			TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
			Sir,-The Italins- consider themselves greatly indebted Eo the moral support of England for the liberation of half of l'aly from Austrin and Papal dominion. Tho peopleofo this country, generally so indifferent to foreign affairs, hsa acquired a certain interest in the lRe Galantuomo and bhi counsellor, and were prepared to welcome, by acolamstlon, the nows of the annecatlon of the pBtient and enduring provinces. Butthe heartless cession of nnhereditary Duse- dom and a Principality has damped the ardour of Italian symnpathizers, and the Interest awak-ened a short time ago for Constitutional Sardinia has reoeived a shock. The feel- ing with which the able commmnications of your "owns correspondent" are now written and read is tinged with melancholy, and but few care to imow what measures are iu store for the new Parliament in Turin to discuss. Nice is sold, with Garibaldi into the bargain, and Savoy is be- trayed. They say the ghost of Humbert of the Whi.t
			Hand is walking about St. Jean do Iaurilene, and asks what the " GaUlic ar,nenta" lwant on the banks of hit native torrent, the indignant shades of 17 Counts of Snvoy end 15 Dules ore ilatteriog along the Isere, or hovering over Mont Blanc, and join their protest with the IdarnotS against the surrender of the cradlo of their race.
			Butthis is not the particular feature in the pollcy of th3 Sardinian Government I wish to signalize.
			In imitation of themagnanimous liberator of Italy, whoac disinterested intervention in favour of the oppremed Italians all Europe now aandres, the Re Galantuomo Is anxious to Eoften the asperities of the Romish hierarchy, and this is to be done by promising a special protection of the religion to which he is devoted. He and his Imperls! ally have both renewed their profession of faith ; equally in.
			volved in the major excommunication, they are now engaged in a pious rivalry for upholding the spiritual dominion oi the Sovereign Pontiff In Frauce Protestaut schools hava in severalplaces been arbitrarily dosedfor some time, as well as Protestant places of worship, and this has lately been. followed up by the arrest and condemnation to fine and Im- prisonment of the poor schoolsaster for giving lessons in private houses when deprived of his schoolroom. Whola communes in the neighbourhood of our Lady of Ls Saletie have petitioned for permission to join themseives to the Re. formedChurch, but tho authorities have not yet seen fit hD grantthatliberty,andthis pandering tothe intoleranceof the provineial bishops is the special protection extended to tbe spiritual authority of the Popo as a recompense for tho loss of his temporalities. But the ex-Dake of Savoy is inspiral with still greater zeaL In his resent speech at the opening of the session he avows himself the defender of oivil liberty, and at the samo time a datifal son of the Church, but ho is silent upon religious freedon and liberty of conscience. I:b is all well enough to appear to brave the mutterlngs of tba thunder of the Vatican; those champions of Italian inde- pendence quail before the priesthood, and are ready tD sanction sn occasional holocaust of Evangelists to appBei
			the wrath and propitiate thefavour of bishops, priests, ani cardinals. While our cars have beon strcined with tho noise of festivities and ovatiouns in the chief cities of eman- cipated Italy, the more humble subjects of Victor Emma. nel have been made to understand what is mcant by liberty when the exercise of Its most sacred rights offends the priests and ruffes the temper of provincial judges.
			There is a little town, Arcola, in the circumscription oE Sarzana, not many mles distant from the marble quarris of Carrara. In that town two brothers, the ono a tailor and the other a showmnker, occupy a honus which in Eng. land would entitle one or both of thea to a vote under, the new Reform BilL These two citizens of the free State of Sardinia wero accused of having opened their shop (boUcyg) for the reception of two scripture readers, and, ts the indictment sets forth, " invited persons to come and hear the readings and explanations then and thereto be made, and so aided and abetted in the diffusion of doctrinoe (massimc) contrary to the prindples of the reiigion of the State ;" the two expositors were-an " Evangelist," ctng under the direction of a religious society, and another of the fraternity of tailors. The Court at Ssrzana is open. Thu day is the 22d of February, 1860. The judges are on the bench ; their names deservo to be recorded :-Do Maaurlw, vice-president ; Lugaro, judge ; Ferrari, judge; Gbo M1ilanes, secretary. The publio prosecutor appears, anfl the advocate for the prisoners is In his place. It wa urged in the indictment against the two brothers Agostinellf that they had actually enlarged their shop by throwiDg down a partition to make more roomfor the guests. Out of 11 witnesses, seven proved that the door was shut, one af- firmed that ho saw it ajar, and another swore it was open The Bible expositors were accused of having msadouseboth of Martini's and Diodati's Bible, which had been imported from abroad, and sold as meurhandise, contrary to law; that those false teachers had maintained, to the scandal ot all good Catholics, that tho worship of images and of the crucifix was idolatrous; that consecrated places of worshp were not absolasely neocesary to " worshipping Goc in spirit and in trath " that auricular confession was not necessary for the remission of sins, but was an inventlonol the priests; and, finally, that Christ, when lie Epeaks of Il brethren, reaUy meant Hs younger brothers. To all theso
			points in theology the sapient judges objected with becoming gravitv, and proved, both from Scripturo and the Counecl of Trent, that such doctrines were hereticaL But, not to lengthen this ak-etch of a document which may stand as a monument of what religious liberty was in Sardinia, with &amp; Constitution 12 years old, here is the sentence:-
			and the first Artlole of the Law of the 5th of Jnly, 14, the Court condemns G. P. Luquet and G. M. Grosso to five days' arrest and 300 livres fine, or imprisonment for 100 days; Agostinelli, the shoemaker, condemned to three days' arrest and 100 Livres fine, or 33 days in prison; and the younger brother, Fr.ancescato, two dasys' arrest, Si ivren tine, or 1Z daysJ imprisonment, ; ed then ali four together ( solidiria.scnte) in the costs. The Cqourt further declares the
			ibles of tiodati (ublshed by theSocietyfor 1romoting Christian Ifnowledge) to be confiscated."
			But after the prosecut.on comes the persecation. The Governor of Genoa, who signs himself " Pozzo," orders his lieutenant at Sarsana to send Grosso out of the country within 4S hours. Three more warrantsare out in the Duchyof Genoa for apprehending as mauy delinquents, two of whom are persons of some consideration. Now, the amount of fines imposed upon these poor honest men at Sarzana wI11 be 7S4 livres, or about 7vl., and to this must bo added al
			costs in the process, which will swell the amount to not less than 100S. The aggregate of days in prison if thls sum be not paid wil be 250. It seems, however, that Grosso is to pay his fine by banishment from his country. Is this, Sir, all we have got for our moral support of the Italian cause 2 Whero is Sir Culling Eardley and the deputation which went to the rescue of tho Madiai in the days of the Grand Duikes ? their crime was no more nor less than that of tho Bible class at Sarzana, and thelr punishmeut not greater. But, what is stil more alarming, the old 'Waldenses are nol safe in Tuscany. The delegate of tho port of Leghorn threatened the minister sent by authority of theVaudolB Church with prison and exile, if he dared to open a place of worship within his jurisdiction, and he announced to the pastor who went from Pisa to remonstrate, that the Government intended to stop the worship of his co-religion. ists at Elorence also. This is hardly credible after the the noble answer written by Baron Ricasoli to the insuffer- able remonstrance of the Archbishop of Florence, and aftd the sentiments knovwn to have been uttered by Farinl. To these two liberal-minded statesmen the friends of rellgious liberty may stil look, and there is yet hope that the Sar. dinlan Government may learn the lesson, so difficult fo statesmen in every country. including our own, to lea-n, that all attempts to conCiliate an implacable priesthood short of ylelding up to them the supremacy in tho Govern- ment are in vain. If the Constitutional Government of Vlotor Emmanuel values the sympathy and moral support of this country, let it repeal the penal statutes which be. long to a bygono age, and which are constantly indicting disgrace upon an administr3tion which can il afford at thi, crisis to lose any of tho prestige it has aoqutred.
			I am in possession of the documents from which the above facts are drawn, and if you can find space in your columns for this letter you will do much to open the eyes of the Sardinian Government to the indignation which awalts it if such scenes as those at Sarzana are found to bh stamped with its cona--rvnce
			VIGILANTIUs.

			MONrBY-MBKETanCIdTYTINTRLLIGENCE.
			THuRSDAY EvrNG.
			The Bank of England have to-day raised their rate of discount from 4X per cent., at which it was fixed on the 29th ult., to 5 per cent.
			Upon theexpediency of the measure little need be raid. The Government quarterly payments have now been made, the dividends are in course of pay- 3nent, and the Bank are in the position of any other banking establishment, and not only entitled, but bound, to charge such rate as from the regular course of the market they m3y find themselves able to obtain. At the same time there is apparently no reason for dissatisfaction on the part of the commer- cial public. Assuming the demand to be strictly legitimate, it must be considered a gratifying fact that the profits of business are such that the doubling of the rate of interest which has taken place during the last three months has had no effect in causing a contraction. High terms of discount, supposing trade to be entirely healthy, are a sign of nothing but national prosperity, and if mny persons, therefore, are disposed to feel anxiety from the present movement, it wil be incumbent upon them to show that they doubt the real sound- ness of our transactions. It was suggested yesterday that our Eastern commerce may not be quite what it appears, but even in that case any objectionable in- fluences that may be in operation can scarcely yet have attained a point to account for what is at present witnessed in the money-market. There is mo other apparent source of danger; foreign loans of all kinds have been smaller than usual during the past year, and the failure of the whole of them has shut out all prospect of an increase in their number for the future. The purchases of goods, wines, &amp;c., from France since the conclusion of the treaty might be thought to offer a partial solution of the difficulty, but the effect of such purchases would have malnifested itself in an exporta- tion of bullion, and it is not an exportation of bullion that 13 now in question, but an abnormal increase of the home circulation. Be the cause what it may, however, the public must see that the movement which has ensued can have only wholesome results. If it springs from health- ful trade all is matter for rejoicing; if, on the other hand, there is anything wrong, which does not ap- pear for the moment on the surface, it is only by a banking pressure such as is now taking place that the evil can be arrested.
			The stock-market opened this morning with a very unsettled appearance, but the measure of the Bank, instead of leading to a further decline, caused a favourable reaction, and prices closed with an a
			pearance of more steadiness than has been observable for two or three days past. The first quotation of Consols for money was 9* to ;, whence they re- ceded to 9-0 to J. On the notice from the Bank they went again to 941 to Jt, and, finally, there was an advance to 94~ to J for money, and 914 to i for the account. Bank Stock left off at 225 to 227; Reduced and New Three per Cents., 921 to J; India Stock, 218 to 221; India Five per Cents., 105 to I; Rupee Fiva per Cents., 97i to 98j; Five-and-a-Half per Cents., 103k to 104; India Bonds, 6s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills, 8s. to 12s. premium.
			There has been rather less pressure in the dis- count-market to-day, and at the Bank the applica- Eons were not nearly equal to those of yesterday.
			The joint-stock banks have raised their allowance on deposits to 4 per cent. For sums below 5001., however, the London and Westminster give only 3. The discount houses allow 4 per cent. for money at call, and 4A with a few days' notice.
			Foreign stocks have been dull, and closed generally the same as yesterday. Late in the afternoon there were some inquiries for Mexican, and an advance took place to 21A to 22. Turkish Six per Cents. left off 756 to 76 ex div. old, and 61 to 2o new ; Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99i; Four-and- a-Half per Cents., 1852, 90; 1858, 90- ; ditto, Scrip. i dis.; Chilian Six per Cents, 102; M.exican, for the account, 21, 4 -, i, and s; Russian Five per Cents., l07i; Sardinian. for the account, 83; - s9panish, for the account, 46i ; Deferred, for the ac- count, 34g and 4a; Passive, 14*,; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 75c and 76; New Loan, 61 t and 61; for the account, 61, i, and L; Belgian Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 55; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 100k and i.
			The closing price of the French Three per Cents. this evening was 70f. 25c., showing a further frac- tional rise.
			The Teutoni3 has arrived from New York with 42,000. for England, and the Tasmanian, from the West Indies, with 65,0001.
			There was no withdrawal of gold of any conse- quence from the Bank to-day.
			During the recent pressure in the money-market a curious idea has been current, that it is in some way to be traced to tho action of the Bank in refusing accommodation to the discount houses. The Bank have advanced their rate of discount solely because the public have drawn so largely upon them as to reduce their unemployed reserve to a comparatively low figure, and it is imn- possible to conceive how the state of things could pe mended by their admitting the discount houses as customers when they find tbemselves obliged to contract their accommodation to the customers already pressing upon them. If they were now to make advances to the discount houses it must be by withdrawing some of the advances alrcady made to the commercial community, and, altho.'.gh the dis- count houses would, doubtless, lend the money again to the merchants, and thus throw it back to the hands in which it was previously held, such a proceeding would be merely like digging a hole to til it up again. The discount houses can require it only in order to supply the public, and the public bave got it already. It is not an increased supply of the brokers for the distribution of Bank-notes that appear to be wa;.ed, but Bank-notes them- aelves, and unless, therefore, the discount houses can exercise some influence over the actual produc- tion of those articles, all question with regard to their functious and the facilities that should be granted themr must appear, at the preseut moment, not only unimportant, but incongruous.
			The ne.v Victoria Six per Cent. Debentures left off to-day at ]04,- to 105 ;. The Committee of Aus- tralian Banks have notified that they will be ready to recive tenders for the sum of 1,073,0001. (for which there were yesterday no adequate bids) on Tuesday next at a price not below the miniimum of 105.
			According to the Government statements from Naples to-day, the outbreak at Palermo was sup- pressed on the 4th inst. There Is great reason to doubt this assertion. A priv-e telegram komPa- lermo to the 5th inst. received in London this afternoon announces that the English residents had Just embarked on board British vessels in the har- bour, and this is a step not likelv to have bern taken if, as is represented by the Neapolitan ac- counts, tranquillity had been restored on the pre- ceding day.
			The MIexican accounts to-day in the NeLw York advices reach to the 22d of March from Vera Cruz. MWiramon is alleged to liave attacked the city on the 17th, but to have been repulsed. He then resumed the bombardment, doing much damage. Another assault was made on the night of the 19th, which was also repnlsed, and on the 21st he raised tho eiege and withdrew towards the capitaL )udgging from former accounts through A1mericau channels, it is not improbablo that the last statement is an invention.
			A meeting of Central American bondholders was hteld to-day, MIr. J. D. Powles in the chair, to con- sider a proposal from the Government of San Salva- dor for the liquidation of the portion of the Central American debt belonging to that Republic. The claim with 32 years' interest nowv amounts to nearly EO,OOOl., and an offer was made of I6,001. in cash or about 4s. in the pound, in full liquidation. The chairman, in pointing out the inadequacy of the proposal, mentioned that from printed state- ments the revenue of the Republic increased from $397,000 in 1S49 to $600 000 in 1S54; that the receipts have always exceeded the txpendilure, that a considerable portion of the domestic debt has been paid off, and that San Salvador generally enloys a greater obare of prosperity than any other part of Central America. The proposal also con- trasts very unfavourably with the arrangements made by Guatemala and Costa Rica for their share of the original liability. The committee of bond- holders had desired to obtain a aettlement on the
			basis of that made with bhe formor country, by accepting 50,0001. 5 per ce.at. bonds, and sacrificing the remaining 30,0001. of the Englisih claim, but had been unsuccessfuL On the other hand it was contended by a representative of the Goverrment of San Salvador that the country is not prospering, and that the revenue suffers from the expenses caused by a chronic state of revolution. The English creditors wern also recommended to take what they could get now, as there is little chance of another offer being made, at least for the next 12 years, and San Salvador may possibly prefer to lay out all her disposable revenue in local improvements, such as harbours, roads, c. Not- withstanding these arguments, however, the pro- posed arrangement wras rejected unanimously, after some strong observations upon the dishonesty of the Republic.

Nearly 3,000 tons of currats have been taken. out of bond at this port from the 7th of March to the 7th inst., 800 tons raisins, and 400 tons figs, nearly all of ordinary aorta to sell in retail at a low figure. Low currants are becoming scarce and this week the demandI appears to be coming back to ietter sorts, which are inordinately reduced in value comparedI with the forner.

			METROPOLITAN.
			A spectal meetlng of this company was held yestehdaY at the London Tavern; Mr. W. A. Wilkinson in the chair.
			The CO[nOArnra said the meeting was held, In complianwc with the standing orders of the onuse of Lords, for the consideration of certain Bils now before Parliament.
			Mtr. BuaBceexa, the solicitor, read theheads of the first Bill, termed the "Metropolitan Rnilway Act, S160.0" It had passed the Hones of Commons, and was in the Home of Lords. The object of the Bill was to authorize the com- pany to extend the works, to purchase certain lands for sta- tions and to alter the level of certain streets, with power to use die mnrkets in Smithfield. Extension of time for suk. iug therailway. There were also clauses enabling the com- pany to release the denoslt on the first capital of j200OO OL, and the second ca-,ital of 700,0001., authorize;d by former A cts; and also in respect of the reduc- tion of the capital from 1 000,000 to 80,0001., and to enable the company to tate the deposit out of the Court of Chancery. It else authorized the construction of a branch to the Euston station of the London and North: Westem Railway Comnany; and errangements for the election of some of the directors who represented the city of London on the Board.
			A motion approving the Bill was adopted unanimously.
			The next Bil was the Great Northem and Metropolitan Junction Act, 1860. Ib authorized a junction with the Great Northern on the west side. The 1111 wvas promoted by the Great Northern Company, and the branch would ho constructed by them. The 'BiQ authorized the Great Northern to raise additional capital.
			Mr. PARSON explained that the Me'ropolitan Company were making the junction on the east side of the Great Northern at their own expense, and the latter company wouwld make the junction at the wvest side at their ow-n ex- pence. Both junctions werasir,gle lines.
			A resolution approving the Bill was unanimously adopted. The other Bill, authorizing a junction with the Metropo- litan Meat-ma,rket in Smithfield was not sufficiently ad- vanced to submit it to the meeting, and the consideration of it would be postponed to the 22d of May.
			The CEs2Nassc caUled attention to the necessity of assist- ing the proposed palaoe at Munswell-hill, on the ground that if constructed it would greatly increase the traffio on their line.
			Mr. PEmsox, thought that an effort should be made to get up a demonstration in which ait the shareholders should join, and all persons on the line whose property was affected by the railway works. It wasproposed thattheLordmayor should lay the firs' stone at the junction with the Great Western Company, and that the ceremony should be cele- brated in every way worthy the occasion.
			Mr. Pxsox would put down.u 00., end thought the ex- pense of the seromoay and dinner might be raised by sub- scriptilon.
			The meeting was adjourned to the 22d of May.

			PERNAMBUCO.
			lhe half-yearly meeting of this company vas held yester- day at the London Tavern; Mr. R. Benson in the chair.
			The report stated that the Mworks had been taken posses- sion of by the company In consequence of the contractor not having proceeded with his contract as be had engaged to do. Reports received by the directors from Brazil showed tbat the company's engineer was prosecuting the works with vigoar. The traffic continued to improve. The dimin3tion in the goods' traffic of the last half-year arose from the ehortness of the sugar crop, whioh was said to be scarcely more than half that of the previous season. The receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of January last amounted to S,54SI. against 7,1911. in the corresponding half of the preceding year, showing an increase or 1,3571. The total receipts for four half.years ending 31st January last amounted to 30,2351. With regard to the loan from the Brazilan Government, the law of August, 1857, had at length been put into operation by the raising of a loan, of which 400,0001. was in virtue of that law accorded to the company. The directors had accepted a tender from Messrs. Waring, Brothers, who had contracted to finish the second section of the line, now approaching towards completion, for a percentage upon the actual outlay, and to constract the third and fourth sections, taking for a basis, as regarded those sections, the original estimates of Mr. Borthwick, the company participatlng in any profit or loss upon the contract. With a view to insure the completion of the line within the time required by the provinoial concessions- viz., December 2, 1861-the contrast provided that Messrs. Waring, Brothers, should be entitled to a bonus if they succeeded in accompllshing it. It was not anticipated that any extension of tlme would be needed, but, in order to provide for the possible contingency, and to secure for the works thefuol beneoit at least of the dry season, the directors had made application for an extenlsion of time, should the necessity for it arise. The agent of the nov contractor, with his staff, went out to Brazil in February haUt, to take charge of thse works, and every arrangement to facilitate the transfer having, as far as coald be fore- sees, been anticipated by the directors, they had every reason to believe that he was now energetlcahly engsged carrying them on. The company had claims to a conside- rable amount against the late contractor in respect of loans and advances made to him, and for damages for breach of contract, as well as for large sums of money expended by the company in perfecting and completing his unfinished and defective works. The full extent and partioulars of those claims could not bo ascertained until ..he railway was finished. The directors having declined to enter into a prematuxo reference, the contractor had com- menced~ proceedings against the company, and those pro- ceedings were now pending. The report .f Mr. W. lL Peniston, the chief engineer, elated that the completion of the works lef t unfinihed by the contractor was now draw- ing rapidly to a conclusion. The progress made on the heavy ~vorks of the second section had beenasrapid and satisfactory as the nature of the ground permitted. The permanent way was joined through the tunnel and ex- tended to near the Victoria station by the end of last year; and they had it now extended to seven and a quarter leagues from Recife. orhialf way between Villa do Cab and Escada. From that part forward to Eiscada the road-bed was ready for the rails, excepting about 150 feet in the centre of Timbo Assa catting, widch was rock, in depth about six feet, and which he had no doubt would be cleared out before the permanent way approached it. From this Timbo cutting to Bscada station they had a temporary rail laid for the convoyance of materials for the bridge aud station. The enlargement of the tannel heading had been completed satisfactorily, so as to admit of their running an eugene through under steam, aStar removing her chimney; this they didon the 14th of January last, and had since then been using the engine for widening the cuttings and emsbankments, and conveying the permanent way materials for the remainder of the line to 13scada. Fe had no doubt of being able to extend the rails to Escada by the end of April. By the time the permanent way reaohed the Escada station they would have four miles of the third section ready to receive the rails. The capital account showed that 813,0961. had been recedved, and 748,9131. ex- pended, leaving a balance of 64,17Sf.
			The OssMRarAe, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the report of the engineer showed that the per- manent way on the first sectionhad been maintainediu good working order, and that nothing had ocorred to impede the trafilo or to affect the safety of the passengers. It was satisfactory to know that the charges for the first section would exceed the estimate by a sum under 2,011f On the second sectioa the works were progressing satis factorily. On the third secton satisfactory progress had been made with the earthworks and in the acqeisition of land.-omreparations were beinv made for carrying on the works on the fourth and last section. He thought the arranGementwhich w,as made with Messrs Waringiwould work eatsfactorily for al parTies. He couid he no draw- back that was likely to occur. As to the traficr no on ever expectedthat Eit would b omuch on the dirst section, nor until the secondnd d third sections vere opened, The work- lug expenses were very heavy, and there was some difficulty in adjustng those matters with respect to the apportion- meent for revenue and capitaL Tuero had is been csome differences us to the arrears of interest dun to the company. They had received the loan from the Governmiet, and by that arrangement many difficul- ties had been overcome. The change in the ALinisters in razit had caused some delay. The Brazlian mntinister bad acted most kindly towards them, and there was every reason to believo tha&amp; good understandpin exised between tho company and the Government. Ho believed the arrange- ment they had made with Messrs. Waring, Brothers, was ahe bet that could be made under the circumstances, and he bad no doubt that the works would be finished by the 2d of December, 1801, although the contractors were net bound to complete them by that tlme. He then adverted to the kind agnd consderate expressions i the openinSpeech of the Peresident of the Province to the Assombly in reriambuco on the subject oE the railway, the management of the directors, and theo exertions of the companys officals. HTe (the chairman) had recetved a-printed paper from Mr.
			ayliso the egant to the late contractor, winch, no doubt, could be completely ans ered h ut, as thematler in dispute wvas in the hands of competent parties, he thought it un- aneessary to refer to it further. Ho was sorry to say there had been considerable sic-nedss on oame of ,he works; a few of their officers had suffered severely, and 10 of their skiled labourers were now comiga home invaplded, Those werecome of theunavoidable evils they had to contend a,ainst, and entitld thoem to consderation. One of their colleagues, Mr. Greenfield, in a visit to South Acmerica on business, would makeapoint of inspecting their works in Brazil before bin return. They had the cordial sup- port of the President of the province oE Pernam- bco, asnd the warm support of the Brazilian tinister in Eng,land, and they had always relied on the friendly feel- ing of the Brazilian Government- therefore, on the whole he on th they should be able to bring the undertaking to a successful issue.
			ser. DICeSof seconded the moion for the adoptimo of the report.
			A long discussion ensued, in whch 3fr. BorrTdaile, hlr. Jones, Mr. Moxon, Mr. Lechwor2, , M0r. Wilde, ar. thaude, and ether shareholders took part. It waous uraed that the directors should not have obtained the loan of 400,0001. from the Government on the terms theJ had, but have raised it on debentures at o par cent, and appropriated the difference between that and 7 per cent, to liquidate any excess of expendlture over the estimate, so aiS to secure the guaranteeof 7per cent, intact upon thewshares To this the directors replied that they endeaveroled to raise the 400,0001. on the company's debentures butn aol that was subscribed wvas 27,0001., and, of course, it was abandoned. The arrangecment with the Go- vernment was that they were to raise for the com- pany 400,0001., and to take the 7 per cent. guaranteed on that portion of the capital, 5 per cent, being paid as inter- est on; the borrowed money, and the rema'ining 2 per cent. set aside to form a sinkingfund which it w as cs'timated w.ould extinguish the debt in about 27 years. The capital would thus be reduced from 1,200,0001, to 800,0001,, and the effect would be that if the trafnic on the line should be suffient to pay7 per cant, on the expenditure of 1,200,0001., the shareolders would receiv 10 per cent, on their shares. Complaints were made that the contract with Mfesrs. Waring was not first submitted to the shareholders for their approval; hut the chairman showed that by a resolution of a former meeting the whole matter was left in the bands of the directors,and they had mado the bestarrang ement they couldfor the comipany, and hehbad no doubt it would work well for all partie3, It wsFl not probablo thab t call on

			IROflirASTERS' QUAR7ERLY MEETING.
			BIRMMNGH&amp;l A TmusAY Evmcm-.
			Tns ironmasters ot tis district heit thelr usual quarterly meeting in the Town-hall here to-day. The attendance, although much larger then at Wolverhampton on Wednes- day, was comparatively small, and from the commencement it was evident that it was to be a quiet quarter-day. The tendency to this increased as tho information became gene- raly known that the rate of discount at the Bank of England a been advanced to 5 per cent.
			The number of shipping finns represented in the hall was email, and the unfavorableitem of information above ro- ferred to seemed to strengthen the disposition of consumers to withhold contat,in the belief that prices will recede. No retrogrademovement took place in the hall to-day, hut the transatos eeon a limited scale ; and if thiings re- main as quiet as they are at this moment, It is pretty certain that some of the needy makers wil have to accept a reduc- tion, however opposed to it the leading firms may bhe Altogether this Vws the most languid quarter-day since that of January, 185.
			A sort of conference took place in the hall between Mr. Philip Williams, as chairmran of the Ironmasters' Asso- ciation, and Mr. W. 0. Foster, MLP., end other members of the trade, on tho one band ; and Mr. Van Wart. Mr. G. A. Everitt, and other members of this Chamber of Corn' merco, on the other, in reference to the vexed queston of the Fr-ench treaty, which is increasingly perplexing to the trading interest in this qusrter. Anuther letter his been received from the Board of Tradle sugg~esting that a, deputation from this district should have an interview with the Board, with a view to such explanations In matters oE detail as may lead to an arrangement eatisfactorily to the French Government; and a deputation to Paris is still presspd as being advisable. But if, on the part of France, the objection is persisted in to the evv of slu ad -valorers duty on manufactsroe
			articles, and it nras mnentioned in the hail to-day, upon high authority named, that such would be the case, little advantuge would acsrus frem any deputation. It is most likely, however, that the suggeetien last maade by the Board of Trade will be adopted in"part at least.

			LONDON, FSrDA Y, APRIL 13, 18s,
			The affairs of Germany form matter of special attention to us only so far as they affect English interests. It is nothing to us whether Austria or Prussia preponderates in Germany. We English have no special favouritism in the Franlfort Diet, and care little whether the great Continental Teutonic race receives its impetus from Dresden or from Vienna. It is, however, very much to our interest, and an object of great and immediate importance to us, that Germany should be united. Germany is in the best sense of the word a con- servative force. Austria, as a separate Power, may have her bad instincts of acquisitiveness, but Ger- many, as a whole, is not aggressive. She is the natural friend of all who wish to hold in peace what they honestly possess and prudently use. She is the natural enemy, or at any rate the natural impedi- ment, of aU who would convulse the world for the hope of gaining by confusion. It is to our interest that this conservative element of an European society should be powerful, and therefore it is to our interest that it should be unitea. This, and this only, gives to events that pass in such little States as Hesse Cassel and Baden sufficient importance to make it expedient to call public attention to them. This only gives interest to the proceedings of the Diet at ranfort, and makes us anxious observers of the rivalries of the two great Powers who there struggle with unequal advantages. While Prussia and Austria are fighting for mastery, Germany ceases to be formidable to wrongdoers. We are, then, in the position of a stout gentleman who knows that there are pickpockets near, and who sees the police quarrelling among themselves.
			The POPE, or rather the modern exaggeration of the claims of the Papacy, is answerable for a great deal of this weakness in the Teutonic race. Austria Is now somewhat placed as Poland waB when the crisi was yet depending which gave the supre- macy to Russia. Russia was liberal and latitu- dinarian,-Poland was earnest, Papistical, and intolerant. The tribes of the East gathered themselves to the tolerant Power, and Poland succumbed, dwindled, and expired. The same
			NESIs is now punishing in Austria a similar offence. Austria had to chooso between the pro- tection of the Ultramontane clergy and the lovo of her people. She cho3e the former, and sealed her choice by that Concordat which handed over the minds and consciences of all her subjects en- slaved to Rome. Wurtemberg and Baden have followed the example set by Austria; and In June of last year the Grand Duko of BADPnn, without consulting his Parliament-and Baden has a Par- liament,-concluded at Rome a Concordat which surrendered to the POPE and to his servant, the Archbishop, all the liberty of conscience which his Protestant subjects had theretofore enjoyed. By this Treaty the rights of the Roman Catholic clergy were as completely confiscated as those of the Protestant laity. The Archbishop acquired the entire patronage of all benefices that were not in the gift of private persons, the appointment of aU the lower orders in the hierarchy, and absolute dominion over the religious housea of both sexes, and all causes ecclesiastical and matrimonial. He obtained power to " control the morals" of the clergy, and to " animadvert" upon any breach of the laws of the Church by the laity. Public and private tuition was given over entirely to this omnipotent Archbishop. The Concordat emphati- cally declares that, " trn instructtionem tumn educa-
			tionem iA omnnibus sch4olis p7tblicis et privatis "diriget et sutper utraque tigilait." In the Uni- versities and public schools he was to be absolute. NTo pupil was to be admitted without his sanction, | and pupils already admitted might be sent away at his command. Thenceforward all Professors and authorities of the IUniversity of Friburg, and, as we conclude, of Heidelburg, were to be chosen only from the Roman Catholic body :-" Afagistri cc omnes giei itu djsnmodi gymn=s1is et lyceis dorceudi ICc muntts e=ercent ex Catholicis viris eru?nt eligelvii." Over the clergy and the laity, over the Universities and the public schools, over even private tuition, !this nominee of the PorP was to be abso-
			lute. Not in Madrid or Mecca, not In i au Irish hamlet or a Covenanters conven-
			ticle, was there so complete an intolerance of any departure from the prevailing religion as was thenceforward to take place in the Grand Dachy of Baden. HrBSRAND could not have demanded greater powers than PIo IX. obtained from Baron DE BRECKHEIM, and Louis XIV. could not have undertaken more ruthlessly to root out heresy from the Cevennes than the Grand Duke FPEDERICK con- sented to see done in Baden. Yet Baden is to a great extent a Protestant State. It has a Parlia- ment, which, if not Protestant, is at any rate anti- Papist, and which, as is shown by its recent division of 45 against 15, is thoroughly opposed to any such insane submission as was made by this Con- cordat. The GRAND DuxB himself is neither a tyrant nor a fanatic. Ee is described by our corre- spondent as yielding to this tremendous assumption of Papal power from mere easy good nature and habitual submission to female influence. The possibility of such an occurrence happening in this 19th century, the fact of a belief being entertained by shrewd ecelesiastics that a large Protestant population could be in this manner handed over to their spiritual enemies, and the hope that such a very strong act of tyranny could be effected in a State whose frontiers lie on France and Switzer- land, and whose towns are thronged with visitors from all the countries of the world, all show what the German people are thought to be capable of enduring, and how far the example of Austria has blinded the ruling Powers of some of the German States to the possibility that they might arrive at a point at which their people might find resistance less dangerous than submission. Fortunately the Constitution of Baden has afforded a peaceful expe- dient for destroying this monstrous usurpation. TThJ popular feeling has been so great that the Mtinister who concluded this Treaty with the Court of Rome-a Treaty like an English Commercial Treaty, in which everything is given up and
			Lumiuug iL oiamea mi rezurn-nas tauen trom power. The Chamber has declared that, " although "it desires the Roman Catholic Church may " enjoy all rights and privileges which are com- "patible with the wellbeing of the State, yet, as "the Convention was concluded Atithout the pri- "vacy and approval of the Diet, it is binding "neither on the Grand Ducal Government "nor on the nation." This is, as we take it, the meaning of the manifesto of the Grand Duke of BADEN, which will be found among our Foreign Intelligence. He retires from his untenable position by promising that the mat- ters absolutely dealt with by the Concordat Bhall be lawfully sanctioned by constitutional authority. That the Chamber will never give this lawful sanction to the Concordat as it stands they have already very firmly declared; and this the GRAND DUYa aud the Ultramontane party thoroughly understand. The HEGELS, and BE csnms, and MEvYSEsUuGs, and all their Austrian clans and kindred, are for the moment disappointed, and Baden stands disunited from that league of serfdom in which Austria placed her hope of dominion in Germany and of power in Europe.
			This is a lesson worth noting. It shows how utterly effete and worthless Austria has become, and how little we can count upon her to do to the world even the service of defending herself. We do not undervalue the power of superstition as a material for unscrupulous statecraft. Superstition, however abject, is strength to those who know how to use it; but it must be the superstition of the multitude, and not the fanaticism of the few. In Austria the superstition is in the rulers, and the common sense is in the people. Weak, and broken, and nerveless as she is, she thinks that her policy is to reduce so much of Germany as she can in- fluence to a dull uniformity, and to do this by a force which she could not exert even if her Princes were conquerors, her armies were victorious, her people were loyal, and her finances were afauent. When the blow dealt at Solferino had broken this great image of brass and clay, a promise was given that Austria had seen the error of her ways, and was about to enter upon the task of a thorough self-reformation. The promise was welcome, because it was felt throughout Europe that if fulfilled it must give back a constitution to Hungary, must cut off all expensive Italian complications, must change the Austrian policy in the Diet, and must induce all those little rulers who make Austtia their model, and rely upon her for their power, to cease to put their faith in the forces of the Con- federation, and strive to govern with liberality and wisdom. Nothing of this, however, has hap- pened. Count RxBcenaG is of that school of statesmen which brings empires to the dust. The l BEnon is a fanatic, without even the energy which fanaticism ordinarily inspires. He believes in concordats, and perhaps in excommunications -the bugbears of another age, and which were powerless against men of purpose even in the darkest times. He does not remember that when Sr. PErm " began to curse and to swear" he was most in fault, and was about to weep bitterly. He is a feeble mind among strong circumstances. It. is dlear that it is to the interest of Germany and to the interest of all peace-desiring Europe that the great German people should gather under another banner, and look for their policy to another head.

			NTo one cmn deny to the Reform Bill of Lord Jo} RussEm.i the posession of the attributo of simplicity, though orne doubt may arise how far that simplidty co-titutes one of the leading merits of the measuze. lAying as we do in an aze when
			all the relations of life are singularly complicated, we are strangely captivated with the notion of simplidty and uniformity, and yet nothing creates such complete uniformity as a despotism, and no- where do we find such perfect simplicity as in the laws of barbarous and ignorant nations, to whom it has long ceased to be the fashion to look for examples to imitate. The Constitution under which we live is eminently complex, so that per- sons perfectly acquainted with its rules and its working have formed the most contradictory theories as to the cause of its unquestion- able success. It is certainly improbable, though, perhaps, not impossible, that this ancient and complicated system can be usefully and safely amended by a measure possessing, indeed, in the highest degree this attribute of simplicity, but effecting in the direction in which it operates a very vast and important change. When the Legis- lature is trying fresh and untrodden ground it is often possible to select a principle appropriate to the emergency in question, and to apply it logically without reserve and without qualification; but the case is very different when we have to deal with the legacies which other ages have left us, with systems the originofwhichcanonlybeunderstoodhistoricaly; systems which make no pretence to scientific accu- racy, which consist, indeed, of the adaptation of the formulce and institutions of one age to the wants and requirements of another, but systems, never- theless, which, having been tested by long ex- perience, have been found to yield all, and some- times more than all, that can be expected of them. A simple measure must be fortunate indeed if it escape the reproach of being rude and one-sided, and equaUy fortunate will be any Reform Bill which can combine with the merit of simplicity the far greater merit of preserving intact the balance and adJjustment of parts, wbich form the distinctive merit of the English Constitution.
			The Bill of Lord Jon Russax differs from the two proiects which emanated from the same quarter in 1852 and 1854 in this,-that it is a great deal simpler than either of them. Both those measures contained provisions for lowering the fran- chise; but in each of those Bills that step in the direction of democracy was qualified by counter- vailing provisions. In the Bil of 1852 it was pro- vided that The smaUer boroughs should be aggre- gated together, thus leaving the counties more open to Conservative influences, and calling in that federal principle which in America has alone been found capable of withstanding to any considerable degree the democratic pressure. We are not speaking of the policy of those provisions, but only of their obvious and unmistakable tendency and intention. The Bill of 1854 was framed in the same sense. There was a great lowering of the frauchise, but there was besides a provision intended to secure the representation of minorities, and a number of what are now called fancy franchises, designed at least to break down the dead uniformity of a suffrage regulated by rent alone. We repeat, we are citing thoae proposals, not because we are advocatea for their adoption, but only as recogni- tions by Lord JoHN Russ=Tr and the Governments of which he was a member of what appears to us, we confess, a sound and valuable principle-the principle that a good Reform Bill ought not to be quite simple, ought not to be wholly one-sided, ought not to go entirely in one direction, but that, if it makes provision for the extension of popular rights, it ought also to provide some check to prevent that provision being abused. Nay, even the Reform Bill of 1832, the fruit and the expression of a popular revo- lution, the instrument avowedly designed to break down monopoly, pensions, and sinecures, and entirely to reconstruct our whole system of Government,-even the Reform Bill of 1832, sweeping and uncompromising as it may appear, was by no means a simple or one-sided measure. The spoils of the disfranchised boroughs were divided between the country and the towns, between the aristocratic and democratic interests, and if the Reform BiR enfranchised the 101. voters it disfranchised many voters possessed of a lower qualification.
			-b -Y.ukiply U2t;.t bUUb1UB�UraA0 W Te
			Bill of the present Government we find that it has departed, whether for good or for evil, from the precedent of former Reform Bills. It is, indeed, a simple measure. There is no attempt at qualification or compensation. Every provision is framed with the same view, and tends with most perfect directness to the same point. If little be done in the way of disfranchisement, that is 3apologized for on the ground of impossibility, and there can be no mis- take as to the direction in which that disfranchise- ment tends. The reduction of the county franchise has, as we have shown, a twofold operation. In some counties it will facilitato the manufarture of votes, and thus for the moment increase territorial domination; in others it will give increased power to the towns, but in both it seems likely to have the effect of dispossessing the middle class of power, and placing it in the hands of the lower classes, to be employed either for their own benefit or at the dictation of those who may exercise influence over them. But the real principle of the Bil is unquestionably to be found in the alteration of the borough franchise, and this alteration means clearly, if the statistics laid before Parliament by the Government are cor- rect, and still more clearly if they are not, as is so confidently asserted, a transfer of power from the middle to the working classes. This may be a great improvement or it may be a great danger, but does it not seem likely that the improvement would be more secure and the danger less to be apprehended if the measure lacked a little of that golden simplicity which is placed in the van as among the foremost of its merits? Is it really desirable to deprive the middle class of that poli- tical power which they have exercised for the last eight-and-twenty years, with results so eminently beneficial to the country ? Would not the change to which we are invited be likely to be more safe and more permanent if it were less violent, less simple, less one-sided? WVe know the classes in whose hands the political power of this country is deposited. The grada- tions from the upper into the middle class are imperceptible; there is no break or hiatus, no solution of continuity, and yet we repeatedly see Governments overthrown for want of a clear appre- hension of their sentiments and opinions. Will it not be wise, before we establish a great gulf between the aristocracy and the working classes by the virtual elimination of that middle class which is at present interposed so as to break the shock between themn,-would it not be wise to consider whether something cannot be done to bridge over this gulf,-something which, if we may use the expression, may break the fal of the franchise, -something which may save this ancient and esta- blished monarchy from the logical application of the doctrine of the supremacy of a mere numerical majority,-something which, while tolerant of new elements, may prevent the total extinction of the old ones ?

			What is to become of our wills Perhaps the best thing would be to screw them down in the coffins of the testators. Or ahanl we staff them inside those hairless camelopards, and worn-out antelopes, aud motheaten tigers, whose impor- tunate claims upon space so distress the authori- ties of the British Museum ? Or shal we distribute them periodically to the baths and washhouses? Or shall we work them
			up into pulp to manufactura those papier. mnach coaches in which the CHASNCETOB of the ExcUEQRux hopes some day to ride down to the House of Commons P If none of these expedients should appear advisable, we hope Mr. CowVIu will suggest something better. At pre- sent there seems to be every probability of our will having a fate somewhat like that of the petitions to the House of Commons, which disappear nightly in innumerable carpet-bags, and only turn up again occasionally in the form of tailors' measures. Some man of resources must suggest something practicaL Men wil die, and they wil not a1l die intestate. Survivors will, do what we may to discourage such curiosity, feel an in- terest in the contents of their wills. Highly deserving of reprobation as such curiosity may be, persons will hurry down to Doctors'-commons, and wil expect to be shown the wiU of their second cousin, from whom they had expectations, or of the father of a lady upon whom they have con- ditionally fixed their affections, or of a respectable old gentleman to whom private ramour bad awarded them some claim of kindred. If it should so happen that there is only a single stool and a single desk for all these curious impertinents, there is hkely to be a crush; and, if a cartload of wills should be daily added to the great catacomb of testamentary declarations which are mouldering in dampness and mildew, there is almost a certainty of some ultimate confu- sion. It is true that when the Duke of Wm=G- roIN was told that a great mass of public records were piled over a powder magazine in the Tower, he only observed that he had looked at the records, and found no reason for any apprehension that they would set the powder on fire. But these wills are very com- bustible. They light up into lawsuits. They go off in splendid flashes of forensic eloquence. They make stuff gownmen into Attorney-Generals, and Attorney-Generals into Lord Chancellors; and they also make poor men into millionaires, and toiling brainworkers into comfortable in- habitants of the Castle of Indolence. We venture to say that if it were proposed to half the JoxzsEs, and S&amp;n=Hs, and RoBiSsoNs who may read these sentences whetherthey would prefer that all the rolls of the ancient statutes, -with the ScaoorP and GnOSVEsNo0 Roll thrown in to boot, and all the records of the Hanaper-office and the Petty Bag-office added, should be burnt in an un- insured house, or whether some particular wil whereof SETH, or JoNas, or RoBIXsoN is cognizant should be mildeved or motheaten, the Smithian, or the Jonesian, or the Robinsonian judgment would be without hesitation given in favour of the sacrifice of the Statute RolL
			Yet it is a sober, serious fact, that you might as well dig in the Monte Testaccio at Rome for any particular bit of old Roman tile as to search in our Registries for some of our not very ancient testa- mentary records. There is no place to stow them. They cannot be found. " There are," said Dr. BAYFOBD in his evidence before the House of Com- mons' Committee, " 26 registers, and it is wholly " out of our power to search them." He tells us that the wills which are every day being proved are put away anywhere, and that to give them a fair security four times the space of strong- room which is now available is absolutely necessary. JoNxEs may have the only document whieh gives him all his uncles property reduced to cinders to- morrow. Sz= may have his wife's will, which took him so much wheedling to accomplish,destroyed to- night. RoBisoN may become the prey of a heir-
			at-law at any moment. Millions of money, yielding tens of thousands of public revenue in the shape of legacy duty, are all at the mercy of a guttering candle, or of a cat springing at a mouse and over- throwing a fireguard. This is so. We cannot print all the blue-books or repeat all the evidence; but a3 the officers, including every one who is sup- posed to be responsible for these things, have come forward and declared it before Parliament. Liberaverunt an,imc.s suas. If the wills are all burnt to-morrow, there wil be no one to blame. Yet it is not the fault of Parliament. The House of Commons has not been niggardly in the matter. They have voted whatever they have been asked to vote. In the summer of 1808 70,000t. were voted for the purpose of enlarging the Registry; but what has become of that money, or how it has been jobbed, or who has absorbed it, or where the balance now is, or into whose pocket it is gone, or whether it has ever been spent, nobody knows. In the last session an Act passed enabling the Board of Works to acquire sufficient space to build a proper Registry, in conjunction with the present insufficient receptacle; but, as the country- man sat down by the Tiber side waiting till the stream should run itself dry, so the Board of Works seems to have thought that delay was the true remedy, and that if they waited awhile the evil would cure itself; that people would cease to die, and wills would cease to pour in. For the last two years the subject seems to have been en- tirely occupied by a correspondence between Dr. BAYFoRD, the Registrar, and a Mr. AusTrI, of the Board of Works. Dr. BAYFORD offers his own chambers, prevails on the Dean of Sr. PAUI'S to lend him the trophy-room, and is ultimately driven out of all heart and hope by the legal necessity of providing for an accumulation of 200,000 wills and of finding stowage-room for the records of the MEarriage and Divorce Courts. At an early period Sir C. E TsEvEmAr stepped in and authorized the hiring of " three unoccupied "rooms at a rent of 501. per annum, and to make "the same available by means of a door between "the houses." Then there was a grave corre- spondence between M1r. Cn&amp;nizs HAwlcns, the landlord, asto the additional insurance required for premises containing such combustible articles as wills; but at last the wills obtained possession of these rooms, and there they remain. Then some thousands of pounds were spent in patching up the old Registry, and 29,00OZ. -were spent on Probate Registries in London and the country, to preserve the wills in the country till a London Registry can be made to receive them. M1eanwhile the wills are piled in old lath-and-plaster rooms, and in corners of St. Pauls Cathedral, everywhere and anywhere; and the College of Advocates are caling upon the Board of Works to tell them whether they will take the site of the College, or whether the Advocates are free to listen to magnificent schemes of warehouses and grand mercantile palaces wherewith enthusiastic specu- lators desire to cover those dingy purlieus that lie behind St. Paul's Cathedral.
			The warehouses that would pay some fabulous sum for the site of this central piece of land would be raised to house stuff and groceries and sides of bacon. I'he owners of these commodities would not hesitate a moment to pay the market price, and have proper space for their goods. Your bacon merchant likes to save his bacon, and your tea merchant has proper notions of the value of his Souchong. But these belong to the persons who keep them in their custody. The wills belong to no one in particular. While this matter has been dragging its slow length along we have had four or five successive Comnisioners of Works, of -whom the will of one, by melancholy fate, ham found its way into the mass of confuEion called a Registry; but, as none of these Ministerm has had time to learn his business, it has been left to be done by underlings. Surely it is time to do this thing at last. It is not a very terrible matter to build a large fireproof building to contain the records of almos' every
			man's possessions in the land; nor is it a subject in which a fair sum of money ought to be allowed to interfere with the thorough perform- I ance of the affair in hand. We are dealing I with a great national necessity-a thing -whlch it is positively criminal to delay. But perhaps MIr. CowPZB may think that with a little procrastination tho business may settle itself. A snug fire in the neighbourhood of Doctora'-commons would remove the difficulty in a night, and would, moreover, have the beneficent effect of giving occupation for 30 years to a whole generation of very meritorious, hard-worldng lawyers.

			-ie intervention of foreign Powers in the affairs '6f Mexico has been recently attended by an In- cident of some importance. We explained some weeks ago the position which the contending parties in MIexico had assumed, and the stage at which the civil war had at length arrived. JuIAnxZ, the leader of the Iaberals, had established his Govern- ment in Vera Cruz, and retained command, n1ot only of that important port, but of the coast &amp;dstricts and lowlands generally. MIzAMOX, his antagonist, was in possession of the capital, and was cupported by a powerful military faction and the active interest of the Church. The ascendency of the latter party had been so far secured that nLAro.r had assumed the offensive, and besieged JuABEZ in Vera Cruz, though without success. The city held out, and i4lisRos's forces remained before its walls. While affairs were in this position efforts were made to reconcile the belligerents by an envoy of the British Government, and it was proposed that a truce or armistice should precede a general cessation of hostilities and a termination of the strife by compromise and adjustment. How far the attempt would have succeeded we can- not say, but in the meantime we have received the Intelligence of a naval engagement in Mexican waters, and the capture of two vessels under Spanish colours by American ships of war.
			The American Government had expressed a strong leaning to the side of JtuAREz, and had entered some time ago into negotiations with that leader, to the great dissatisfaction of MIRAmo., who protested against the proceedings. In the harbour of Vera Cruz lay two American ships, the Saratoga and the Savannah, forming part of the home squadron of the United States, and despatched to those waters for the protection of American interests. On the morning of the 6th ult. two large steamers were descried making for the shore. They had no colours flying, nor did they pay any attention to the signals made from the castle of Vera Cruz by the Mexican authorities, but pro- ceeded on their course, as if with a settled object and in concert with each other. Upon this the commander of the American squadron ordered Captain TunENE, of the Saratoga, to follow them and ascertain their character and pur- pose. This order was carried promptly into execu- tion, and resulted, as will have been seen from the despatches which we yesterday published, in a smart action and the capture of the two steamers. They proved to be from Havannah, laden with munitions of war, and fitted out to operate against the JuIanEz Government at Vera Cruz. Into the details of the engagement we shall not enter. The importance of the incident consists in the act itself, and in the results which arose out of accidental circumstances.
			According to the despatches of the American commanders, which are written under a manifest impression of the gravity of the occurrence, the Americans fired in self-defence. Their boats, which had been sent to overtake the strangers, were saluted by a hot fire of muaketry, and this, of course, was returned, lintil one steamer was boarded from the boats and the other captured by the Saratoga. It is alleged, indeed, that the commander of the offending steamer does not deny the charge, but excuses himself by declaring that his crew, a raw and half-trained mixture of sailors from various countries, persisted in firing upon the approach- Ing boats, against his distinct orders. The result, Z1owever, ls that these -vessels, which when the action commenced hoisted Spanish colours, and which are declared to have been en- gaged on behalf of the MIniRmoN party, have been made lawful prize by the ships of the United Statea. A particular circumstance, too, which Captain Tunxm reports with " the deepest con- " cemn and regret," has added to the complications suggested by the event. It appears that a General of the Mexican army was on board one of the zteamers towing the American boats, and was badly wounded in the engagement. Hlis own ex- planation is, that he was left on board accidentally, and the American commander, it is said, was entirely ignorant of his presence; but the incident Is likely enough to be pressed to awkward conclu- sions if any trouble ensues.
			Such is the present state of affairs in those parts. We must wait for further intelligence before we can speculate on the consequences which this occurrence may produce. As regards Mexico itself, we can have but one wish, and that is, that a country so peculiarly endowed with all the ingredients of national prosperity should be relieved from the effects of destructive and demoralizing strife. Mexico, one of the most favoured regions in -the whole world, the seat of an ancient civiliza- tion, and the home of a people who need only self-control to be free and happy, has literally gone to pieces for lack of organization and govern- ment. Not only is there no Government in the country, but there is no party-if by that term is meant a section of the community animated by strong political principles, and bent upon settled political designs. The Liberals, under the present leadership of JUARE7, represent the classes most in- elined to liberal institutions, and to the establish- ment of a republican polity on the American model; but they have no strength or cohesion, nor have they shown any ability, even under favourable chances, to maintain themselves in power. The party under Xmnurox includes the priests and their partisans, snd these are probably the only people who are acting on definite convictions and with steady views. They are supported by a portion of the 21exican army, which appears to have inherited the true Spanish propensity for political revolt, and are, perhaps, on the whole, the stronger of the two, -though not so much so as to gain decisive ascen- dency. What prolongs this miserable strife is that a majority, probably, of the whole population cares for neither one party nor the other; nor, indeed, as far as We can infer, for any principles at all. Large numbers have taken to open brigandage, and the utter abeyanee of law amounts, in fact, to general anarchy. Beyond the camps of the con- tending parties there is no authority in 3Mexico whatever. A strong tribe of Indians could over- .un the State-in fact, these savages are actually masters of the frontiers, and can harry the border provinces as they please. Mleantime, the country is Eo naturally rich, and has attracted such large investments of foreign capital, that half the Governments of Europe have an interest in its affairs, and are waiting in observation for the course which events may take. WVe can only add that a decisive settlement seems, unhappily, as remote ns it is desirable, unless Droduced by foreign interference. There is no party to be established in the country itself. The priestly adherents of absolutism could never maintain them-
			salves, nor has any dictator yet permanently pos- sessed himsel Of military power. As to the Le*Jabb whose c3use is. of course, nominally the
			better one, they have failedso repeatedly, and have so slight a hold on that popular feeling by which alone such a cause could be sustained, that we should despair of seeing them fimly established. They can prevent the entire ascendency of their adversaries, but that is all; and between them the State is crumbling into such utter ruin that in a short time we may have to look in vain for even the Eemblance of civil organization.

			"The packet arriving here brings news from Naples to the 7th inst.
			" The official Giornale di Napoli of the 6th inst. confirms the repression of the insurrection at Palermo on the 4th.
			" Letters received add that the rebels attacked the Royal troops at 5 o'clock in the morning, then reformed and shut themselves up in a convent, which they barricaded.
			" A battalion of the 6th Regiment of the Line made a sudden assault upon the insurgents, but were driven back with considerable loss. The Royal Artillery then opened a breach, and the con- vent was taken by assault.
			"The insurgents and their arms were captured.
			" Several bands of rebels having risen in the environs, in order to create a diversion, they were beaten, and pursued in all directions.
			" The official journal does not speak of an insur- rectlon in Messina, but announces that General Salzano has placed Palermo in a state of siege, and also adds a telegraphic despatch, received on the afternoon of the Oth, which affirms that all the other provinces of Sicily have been tranquil, and that the inhabitants of Palermo had not taken part in the contest of the 4th.
			" Letters state that on the evening of the 6th an immensecrowd, estimated to number 80,000, blocked up the Rue Toledo, at Naples, aud raised numerous shouts of ' Viva la Costiitzionc' before the resi- dence of the Papal Nuncio. The street was quickly cleared by the patrols.
			"c APRI 12.
			"A letter from Naples states that the contest at Palermo was very bloody, most of the insurgents having perished at the barricades. Several monks of the convent were seized and imprisoned. Rein- forcements had been sent into Sicily. The com- mercial steamboats have been put into requisltion, and the army in Sicily will be augmented to 30,000 men. Prince Castelcicala has returned to his post as governor of the island. Prince Filanoieri has arrived in order to confer with the King. The panic at Naples on the 6th inst. was general, but without consequence."

			" The answer of Austria to theCirelar Note of M Thonvenel of the 13th of March on the annexation of Savoy and the district of Nice to France has been sent to Paris. This answer is very similar to the despatch of Russia on the same subject.
			"T The Austrian Cabinet, like that of Russia, does not raise any objection to the fact of annexation as lona as this annexation is represented as being the result of a cession freely consented to by Piedmont, and not as the effect of an appeal to universal suf- frage. As regards the neutrality of Switzerland and the neutralized districts of Chablais and Fauclgny, Count Rechberg expresses a desire that the French Government, in accordance with the promises given by AL Thouvenel in his despatches, should maintain the guarantees stipulated by the treaties.

			INDIA AND CHINA.
			By the arrival of the Calcutta ma{l we have Te- ceived our private correspondence and files of papers from Calcutta to the 8th of March, and from Hongkong to the 28th of February.
			The following is the letter of our Calcutta cor- respondent;-
			" CALCUTTA, MARCnE 8.
			"Mr. Wilson's plan for a new currency, the out- line of which will reach you weeks before this let- ter, has excited some surprise. It was expected that he would base his State paper currency on the cash balances-mobilize, in fact, the 10,000,0001. always remaining in specie in the treasuries. To judge by a telegram just received, that an- ti'cipation seems to have been shared by Sir Charles Wood. That plan, however, is small compared with the one actually adopted. Mr. Wilson bases his scheme upon the entire coin- age of the emplre, and not upon the balances, and propomes to relemse gradually two-thirds of the silver in circulation. As this silver, whatever its amount, is equal at all events to double the quantity struck at the lint in the last 23 years, and that quantity is 105,000,0001. sterling, your readers may imagine that the scheme Is at least sufficiently broad.
			"'The plan adopted is as follows:-Mr. Wilson divides all India into currency circles. In each circle will be a Commissioner charged with the duty of receiving money and issuing notes for his circle. All the Commissioners are responsible to a Chief Commissioner sitting in Calcutta, and controlling the entire istue. This latter officer will be inde- pendent of the Viceroy, and subject to no orders, unless conveyed through an Act of the Legislative Council. Each Commissioner will issue notes from the value of five rupees and upwards for all money tendered to him by the State or individuals. Of the money he will keep one-third in cash, and invest the remaumng two-thirds in Government paper at the rate of the day. The notes of each circle are legal tender within the circle, and con- vertible on demand within the circle and at the Presidency-office. Forgery is prevented by the use of the Bank of England paper, and over-issue by the necessity of retaining cash and securities equal to the entire amount oi the notes out. Govern- ment, of course, will pay everybody in these notes; and in time, if they are popular, they may become the general currency, as in Scotland, and release a vast proportion of the coinage. The result, according to MIr.Wilson, will be a general cheapening of silver, followed by a rise in all prices till checked by an export of specie, which thus, for the first t-ime in history, will begein to he exported to Europe from India.
			"The charters of the Banks of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay are to be revised, and their privilege of issuing notes withdrawn, a notice which has created a very absurd panic among the native shareholders. The privilege, from local reasons, the principal of which is the expense of stamping, reissue, and establishment, is worth very little, and MIr. Wilson promises comnpen- sation in the shape of the removal of tbe restric- tions which now prevent the banks from taking their share of discount and exchange business. The ultimate result will probably be a largeincrease to the profits of the banks, which still retain the State itself as their larmeest shareholder.
			"Mr. Wilson's speech is full of general principles, which would not greatly interest your readers. He, however, rejected definitively the plan of intro- ducing a gold standard, as one contrary to the public faith. Every transaction throughout the empire was based upon the supposition that agreements for money implied agreements for so much silver.
			" The general opinion here, native as well as Euro- pean, is strongly in favour of the new plan, which will be brought into rapid though gradual ope- ration, beginning with the Presidency towns, and workingfrom them into the interior. The only objection raised against the notes is tcheir local- ized character. The advantage of a note current in all the crcles would have been enormous. The obstacle was, I imagine, the verygreat diffi- culty of transporting masses of silver to meet
			a local rus.L :e bank ot England can supply a local demand in Manchester or Liverpool in an fL w hours; but our nearest commercial city is 11 days distant from Calcutta (by bullock train); and even when the railways are completed, half the empire will be many days distant from the com- mercial centres. Evea thus limited the new cur- rency will greatly facilitate all commerceandremove our Indian difficulty-the transmission of treasure from the interior to the capitals. It will, moreover, produce very great profit to the State. The very heavy charge for remittances of treasure-equal, it is said, to the cost of an army of 30,000 men-wiU be saved. So wiU the whole amount of interest payable on the securities held by the Com- mission as a reserve. The liberation of the coinage, also, wil immensely facilitate that exchange of a revenue in kind into a revenue in coin, which has remained a difliculty for a century, and in years of great harvest is stiU almost insuperable.
			"A very grave series of circumstances has oc- curred in Krishnaghur. As you, perhaps, are aware, the mode of growing indigo in this country is to make advances to the ryots on condition of receiving a certain number of bundles of the plant in return. The ryots like the advances very much, but they do not like growing the indigo, which oc- cupies the best rice land, and does not pay so well. They always try to evade their contracts, and in Bengal a civil suit for redress is an absurdity. It takes usually 12 months to get the suit on the file, though it may be decided pretty quickly-say, in five months, when once on. Accord- ingly, the planter, done out of bis money, and out of his indigo, is too often apt to resort to compul- sion. Government have repeatedly tried to check this practice, and, in some districts, as Tirhoot it has been wholly abandoned. In some it exists still, and wherever it exists the cultivation is unpopular. A few months ago an over zealous magistrate issued an order to the heads of police, which I subjoin
			" PzwB NA.-lNo. 1,603.
			"'To THE DABOoMI OF TmiiEAH EKLAROOAu.
			'Be it known,
			'A letter of the magistrate of Baraset, dated August 17, 1859, has arrived, enclosing extract of a letter, No. 4,516, from the Secretary to the Government of Bengal, dated July 21, 1859, and addressed to the Nuddea Commissioner, which, in referring to certain Indigo matters, states that the ryots are to keep nossessionof their ownlands, sowlng thereon such crops as they may desire ; that the do.lce should take care that neither indigo planters nor other persons should interfere with the ryots; that indigo planters shall not be able, under pretence of the ryots having agreed to sow indigo, to cause indigo to be sown by the use of violence on the lands of those rycds; and that if the ryots have indeed agreed to do so, the indlgo planters are at liberty to sue them for the same In the Civil Court, the Foujdaree Court having no concern in the matter, for the ryots can bring forward numerous objections to their cultivating the indigo, and i respect of their denial of the above agreement.
			"ITherefore this general Pervvanah is addressed to you that you may act in future as stated above.
			"'The 20th of August, 1859.1
			(True translation.)
			"The people accepted this order as an order not to grow indigo, and half the factoriea of Krishna- ghur were stopped. Encouraged by this suc- cess the people rose. Bands, armed with clubs, traversed the country and threatened death to all who cultivated indigo, and promised to attack the factories. Once up their demands increased, and they are now refusing to pay rent, to natives as well as Europeans. The chief attack, however, is directed against the latter, whom the people pro- mise to drive out of the country, and as the spirit has spread into Moorshedabad, and is spreading into Jessore, the danger to order is considerable. I state only the ascertained facts, but the belief in the district is that the movement is the forerunner of an agrarian insurrection, of which it may be long before we see the end. The peasantry once up are cortain to attack the rich, and more especially the money-dealers, and there is little force at hand to put them down. All who remember the Santhal rebellion of 1855 wil re- member the frightful rapidity with which an Indian protest passes into a murderous insurrec- tion. The lAoutenant-Governor, I understand, is hurrying dowvn from Patna to take measures to tranquilize the disturbed territory; but the next account may he much more serious. As yet the affair Is only a dangerous torn out, resembling the strikes which 20 years ago used to alarm some districts in the north of E;ngland. The real. root of all these troubles, as of the Santhal rebel- lion, is the infamous condition of our civil courts, which precludes civil redress for civil injuries. It is not that the courts do injustice, they are fair Puough, but from the forms of procedure and the
			nnlimited right of appeal every claim for debt assumes the character of a chancery suit.
			" Sir Hope Grant left Calcutta for Singapore on the 26th of February, but the stores have scarcely began to be sent. There is no chance of opzra- tions before July, and nobody on this dde of the water believes there is any chance at all. General Mansfield has gone to Bombay to await final orders. He did not decline to go to China, as reported, but simply pointed out certain inconveniences which his selection as seacond in command might occasion. If the Commander-in-Chief, or rather in this case the Cabinet, adhere to tha origilal plan, he will join his command in excellent time.
			" P.S. There Is a panic to-day among the holders of Bengal Bank shares, which have fallen 401. a share since MIr. Wilson's speech. There are very few sellers howrever, at those rates, the majority of 13uropean holders being in England. I mention the fact to warn them not to sacrifice their property till they have heard Mr. WVilson's plan for compensation."

			"The published quotationforBank of Bengalshares at 2 p.m. yesterday was 4,500r. per share, being a fall of 1501. a share. There are, however, no sellers at that rate, and the panic cannot last many days. It is utterly unreasonable."

			CHINA.
			FROMI OUR OWM? COBRESPON-DE'T.1
			HONGKONTG, FJe. 2S.
			The London mail of the 10th of January arrived here on the evening of the 26th inst. The outward mail leaves at 2 p.m. to-day, per steamer Singapore.
			Nothing of prommnent importance has occurred during the past fortnight. The preparations for the -northern expedition are going on steadily here, and we learn that the Chinese Emperor is also making the best USe of his time in defensive preparations in and around Pekin. Her Majesty's ship Actmon and the steamer Sampson, with two gunboats, left Shanghai on the 16th inst., under sealed orders, which has given rise to various speculations as to the special service on whieh they are bound. The current report is that they have gone to inter- cept a fleet of junks which lately sailed for the north, principslly grain laden, hut also carrying munitions of war for Tien-tsin.
			General Montauban and suite arrived by the mail ste amer, an d, wve understand, pro cceed imme diately to Shanghai. A dmiral Le Page remains here. Sir Hope Grant is expected shortly from Calcutta. We hear the 24th Regiment had reached Singapore, and may soon be here now. All the available men-of- war steamers have been sent to Singapore to tow up the transports.
			From Japan accounts are unsatisfactory. A native interpreter employed by the British Minister has been murdered, and the Government are pur- suing a course of action likely to lead to complica- tlons. The Japanese Ambassadors were to leave for San Francisco on the 10th inst., in the United States' steamer Powhattan and a steamer belonging to the Japanese Government, but temporarily com- manded by Lieutenant Brook, of the American navy.
			From Cochin China there is nothing new.

			Freights remain unaltered.
			Foochow advices are to the 21st inst. During the past fortnight demand has continued, and holders, being very firm, have obtained an advance of 14 tael on low ordinary to good common congon, and 2 to 24 taels on better class tea. Oolongs are 1 tael higher also, and, looking to the reduced stocks,-viz., 25,000 chests congou and 400 half-chests oolong, together with the small quantity expected from the districts,-we do not antlcipate any reduction in price. The quality of the stock on hand is mostly " low" and " good common to middling." The supply of oolongs has almost ceased. Tea men have eelayed tbeir de. parture for the produCing districts longer than usaal, and are evidently anxious as regards political events. Foochow is so situated that in the event of an edict for the expulslon of foreigners It could not be defended without a body of troops of sach magnitude as could 11 be spared for the ser- vice. The place would probably have to be abandoned, and this has been spoken of as a very possiblo contingency. Sales have been Z2,690 chests congon, at 1O to 24 taels ; and 4,200 half chests oolong, from 14 to 22 taels. A good deal of the above is for the Continent, Australia, and India. Arrivals have been only a very few small parcels. The de- partures are one vessel for London and two for New York. two vessels are loading for London at 21. 10s.

			Tea.-In black tea a good business has been transacted. and for blackish leaf kinds an advance of 14 to 2 taels has been established. Holders remain very firm, stocks being small, and few arrivals expected. The green tea men have shown some anxiety to quit their remaining stock and return to the country, fearlng the approsch of the UlIed forces, and alarmed by the departure, nuder seaed orders, of Her Majesty's ship Actuon and steamer Sampson1 with two gunboats, bound northward. Of the finer kinos of greens a decline of 2 taels has been submltted to, but the secarclty of the interior kinds has supported their value. Settlements have been 23,000 chests black and 26,000 half-chests green. The supplies received during the fortnight have been Insignificant.

			THE PROBATB BEGISTRB
			TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-WiUl you caU the attentlon of the publio to the dis. graceful state of the Probate Court Registry, caused by the neglect of duty by the Board of Works?
			In the last session of Parliament an Act was passed en- abling the Board of Works to acquire suffident property whereon to enlarge the present reglstry; and, if the evi- dence produced in committee on that Act by the solicitor of the Board be true, there can be no excuse for the delay which has taken place.
			I beg to subjoin the following evidence in proof of what I have stated. In addition to what follows I refer you to the report of the Select Committee and the evidence printed by order of the House of Commons, from which it appears that the distriot registrars are not paid by salaries, as they ought to be, as there is no room for the additional wils that would be brought to the principal registry, if Dr. Bayford's opinion be a sound one; and the country is losing some 20,0001. per annum by the excess of fees now received and pooketed by the district registrars, agreeably to the provi- sions of the Act, until salaries be given to them.
			EviDEaCE OF DR. BAYFORD, THE SENIOR R EGIsrhAR
			(COURT OF3 PROBATE ACT). He says:
			" The Act, aftercreating 40 districts, leaves the remainder of the country in charge of the prindpal registry. The prin- clpal registry has more than one-third of the grants of the whole kingdom. The mode in which the country has been dealt with is this :-Requisitions have issued from the Judge, calling upon the different registrars of the courts from which testamentary jurisiotion was removed to bring aU their testamentary documents to the district registry provided for that distrlct, and the same ought to be done in regard to the principal registry. In the portion of the country which is allotted to the principal registry there are 26 local courts, and we ought at this moment, in order to fulfil our duty as the Act lays it upon us, to be able to receive all the papers from those 26 local courts, and, in case of any grant being applied for with respect to a person who might have lived there, and in respect of whom there might have been another grant made by any of those courts, to search and see whether another grant had been made, because, if we make a grant when there is one outstanding. of course the second grant is invalid. Under these circamstances we are utterly unable at this moment to fulfil our duties, or to tak;ethe ordinary care which has always been taken with respect to every grant. There nre 26 registries, and It is wholly out of our power to search them. We ought to be able to search with respect to any grant."
			"By a MxBnER.-rS that in consequence of the want of space to contain the large number of documents which you wil have to receive owing to the abolition of these 26 local courts ?-Yes; we cannot receive them. We are obliged to leave them where they are. The next pressing necessity which I wvish to point out to the committee arises from our present strong-room."
			He then states that the present strong-room is quito full He goes on (12):-
			"U Under the Act, also, we have to receive copies of every will proved and a record of every grant of administration that Is made in the 40 district registries ; we are obliged to receive them under the Act, and we do receive them, and we use them, but we have no proper place of deposit for them; we are obliged to put them in any place where we can stow them away; we have no fire-proof place, or any thing of that kind for keeping them in. l
			He goes on (13) :- .
			"sNow, under the Matrimonisl Act there is no registry pro- vided for the Matrimonial Court, and there is no provision for the appointment of a eingle officer in the Matrimonial Court; and the Act obliges the officers of the Comt of Pro- bate to serve in the Matrimonial Court, and, therefore the registry of the Court of Probate Is obliged to be appied as a registry for tho Matrimonil Court, for there is no power in theAct to purchase any reglestryor to appoint a single clerk; consequenty all that Is thrown by the Act on the Probate Court. The Act also provides, that under an order of the Secretary of State all the documents relating to matrimonial matters shall be deposited in one place, brought up and kept in the same manner as those belonging to the Probate Court; consequently that duty devolves upon the Court of Probate. We have no possible means of carrying it out. We cannot even receive tho former documents of which I have spoken, which are much more important than these would be. Therefore I may put It to the committee in this way, -that we want space for the divorce papers; that we want additional room for the wils that we are now proving day by day; that we want room for the copies of wills and grants sent up from the country ; that we want room for all the orlglnal books that I have spoken of before, and for the records from tho 26 different courts. That is the room we actualy want in order to fulfil what these two Acts of Parliament have thrown upon theprindlpal registry. We have gone into some consideration of the space that would be required to do this, and we find that four addi- tional rooms as large as the present strong-room will be re- quired for these purposes. that is the nearest approach that we can make from going over the several registries. There Is another very great want that we have-namely, a room for the public. The distress that eople are pt to iu coming to search for wills and in rea g wlls is very Great. I must say that they have shown considerable torbearance In not filling the newsyapers with letters of com- plaint against us. We cannot do any better for them. There are numbers of people every day crowded together without any proper areommodatlon searching for wills, reading wllls, and so forth. The only room at present in which we can place them to read original wills is one in which there are four or five clerks-a room somewhere about 9 feet by 11 feet. There is just room, Ithink, for four or five persons to sit. In the outer office, where the searches are rmade, we have a seat foe one gDrson, and this Is all we can do for the public at present,"
			Thse extracts are sufficlent, I should think, to justify the public in requiring some explanation from the Board of Works as to the why and wherefore the registry remains in this inefficent state. In the summer of 1858 70,000t. was voted for the purpose of enlarging the registry. What hisbecomeoftbeemoney? Andinthe last session an Act of Parliament passed enabling theBoard of Works to acquire sufficlent space, &amp;c. Why, then, have no steps been taken to carry that Act into effect? Surely some reason ought to be given why nothing has been done?
			I am, Sir, your obedlent ssrvant.
			A WILISB.REOE.

			REFORMf ATEBTING AT ASNECSER-
			I (By ECM-IC AN INT ATIOS;AL T=GRAPM)
			MANCHESTER, TH sDAY.
			A meeting of the Tamcashire eformere union vas held at the Free Trade HaU this evening to consider the question of Reform, with especial refereone to Lord John Russell's Bil. Mr. G. Wilson presided, and there were about 5,000 persons present.
			After addresses from Mr. Barley, DLP., Mr. rekt
			Ryland, of Warrington, and ME. enry Aahworth, of Bolton, which were listened to with great impatience,
			Mr. BriGHT rose, and was received with loud and long- continued cheering. He s31d, though it wvs a holyday time both forhard-worlingpeople and formembersof Parliament hs thought it was never inopportune for the citizens of a free country to meet and discuss questions of publica Interest and importance. Wo were now arrived at an in- terval, or sort of half-way hose in the session of Parlia- ment, and It would be an advantageous opportunity to smr- vey the past ana glance at what ws in store for us in the Immediato future. Looking back to the last two months icc Parliament, he was glad to be able tosay that whatwo beheld was highly satisfactory. If it had not been for the enormous, the needless, and he might say the guilty- military expenditure, he would have been wiling to. express unmixed approbstlon of Mr. Gladstone's Budget. We should probably have had a good Badget from Mr.Glad- stone even if there had been no commercal treaty with France, but that treaty made it doubly valuable. By means of the two every vestige of Protection had been swept from the tariff. The treaty would come into full operation in three yers from that time. He beiheved wea Ehould find the tariff of France much more liberal than the present tariff of the United States. If we now exported 23,000,0001. worth yearly to the united States, how much shouald we export to France-a country more populous and much nearer to our shores-when we had a more liberal tariff than that with Amerca .9 How were this Budget and treaty received? The treaty wss reedved with marked coldness by botliHouses, and hotly opposed by a large party in the Commons. They said It was not according to precedent, and that the chief apostle of free trade did not know his own business. (Laughter.) They said, the French tariff ought to be lower, and that it ought to come into operation at once. Well, that was to the loss of France. (Hear, hear.) They said it had not received the sanction of the French Chamber, but that It was carried Into effect on the sole wll of the Emperor. If It was passed in accordance with the French Constitution, andl the mode of enactng It was sufficlent for France, it ought to be sufficient for us. They said the duties were chiefly taken offluxuries. The truth was we had not many article left except luxuries the duties on which could be abolished. lie Times said we ought to have left the treaty to be nego- tiated by an experienced diplomatist. We had diplomatists in all parts of the world receiving enormous salaries, yet we should look in vain for any service renderedl by them to English industry, equal to the service done by the unpaid and inexperienced diplomatist, Mr.
			Cobden. (Loud cheers.) But the true reasons against the treaty had not been given in the House of Commons. The Budget abolished several sources of indirect taxation, and had tied up the milicary expenditure by a tax from which hereafter there would be no escape. Henceforth these two things would go together. If Parliament raised the mihl- tary expenditure to 20 or 30 milions that increase must be defrayed by an income-tax, or by an income-tax coupled with a property tax. He (Mr. Bright) thought it a most happy thing that this result should have been brought about. This treaty promised peace and confidence with! France, but there were persons connected with the oli- garchy and the military service who wished for a different policy. Oct of the 125 years previous to 1815 we were at war with France during 68 years. When the system began our taxation amounted to 2,000,000?. In 1815 it had reached to 72,000,0001., and we had an accumulated debt of 800,000,000b. All this took place under a system in which only the " select" were allowed to vote, in which the great aristocratic republic stood supreme, uninterfered with by the breath of public opinion. The treaty concluded with France menaced this patrimony of tamation, and hence the concealed opposition to its being carried into effect. Be- sides those questions of the Budget and commercial treaty, Parliament had been caUed upon to consider the questlon of Parliamentary Reform. Lord J. Russel's BiU must be taken for what it was-viz., a Bill for the extension of the franchise. It only remotely touched upon the redistributon of seats, and did not comprksethe ballot. Theboroughvotsrs in England and Wales now on the register numbered 440,00?, and he believed the new Bil would only add 167,000. Was that a measure likely to glve an Ignorant and excited mob a preponderant power In all the borough3 of England ? Ia 1S32 It was said the new voters ensran- chised by the proposed Reform Bil would swamp the old constituencies, and the same argument was being used at the present time ; yet the 10?. householders hadnever conspired, so far as he knew, to swamp the power of persons of property and education. Mr. Whiteside, in a recent debate, had tried to frighten the House by reference to the strike of the London builders. Now, It had never been proved that strikes were bad. A strike was the reserve power in the hands of the working man. He (Mr. Brlght) would tell worling men never to surrender their right to com- bine with their fellow-men in support of their interests. (Loud cheers.) He believed Mr. Disraeli would be glad to allow the present Bil to pass, so that the question of Refors should no longer obstruct his battles with his old antago- nists, the Whigs. Others among the Tory Opposition would also wilingly give It their sapport, but he feared the polcy of lukewarm Liberals. He, however, gave credit to Govern- ment for bringing forwardthemeasure, andhoped they would take care itwas notdamagedin its passage throughthe House. If it should not be passed this session, or was much longer delayed, he would recommend the working classes through- out the country to appoint delegates from their trades unions and societies to sit permanently In London, to art upon Parliament, and to tell it that they did not longer in- tend to be put off and trifled with, and cheated of their just expectations. (Cheers.) Mr. Bright then drew a paralld betwveen the present time and that of Mr. Pitt with regard to the Reform Bill and commerclal treaty with France. In 1784 Mr. Pitt;s Reform measure was ro- jected, and his commercial treaty was got rid of by wr with France. He warned the people to see that the ssme coursewas not adopted now. Therewasa party In this comntry whosystematcall1jendeavoured toarousean m11-feelingagainsb the Frenchnatlon. Tiec Times was following in the wake of the Mforninsg Advertiser, not in the same pot-valiant style, perhaps, but with a maiigaity if possible more satanic, try- ing to arouse a spirit against the French nation. From week to week and from month to month it published leaders, one day insulting France, next day alaming Germany, and another timeexcitingEngland. (Cheers.) Heknew whatwould be said in reply to this, but he was not writing anonymously. He was an Englishman like themselves, caring nothing for the revillugs of the press, but caring dearly for the solemn interests of his country. His warnings were not unnecessary. He spoke not to the Court, for though honest, his speech was scarcely tuned to Courtly ears. He spoke not to the arlstocracy, who, wrapt in luxury, cared not to listen to his appeals; but he addressed the great body of his fellow-countrymen. In a few years this treaty would become a bond of per- petual peace. Stick to it. It mlnht yet be wrested from their hands, With peace the progress of Ee_ form could not bo arrested, and political power in this land would be transferred from a cligue of familles to a great natlon.
			Mr. Bright concluded amid great cheering, having spolken I hour and 20 minutes.
			The meeting broke up immediately after.

			FOREIGN INTELUGENC
			FRANCE.
			JA portion of tho following appeared in our Eecond otlon of yesterday :-]
			(FROM OWUL OWN CO}RSPONDIEiT.)
			PARIS, WEDOESDAY, AparrJ 11, 6 n.r.
			Though I could hardly believe that the " commu- nuiqyu" pretending to rectify the absurd statement of the Pa'rie about England having got up the Carlist insurrection in Spain proceeded from any other than a subordinate pen, yet I hear of another version which it is affirmed is the true one. Accord- Ing to this, the " communiqgd," desecbed as coming from the " M1inister of the Interior," came in reality from the Tuileries, and, without any reference to the Minster, or the " Director of the Press," went at oncea to the Patrie. At the Home-office notice was taken of the expremsions which I have already alluded to as not very friendly, namely, " puissance voisine" and C authenticit4."
			An employe of the Alinistry was sent to the Tuileries to inquire if it was through inadvertence, or deliberately, these words were put in. The answer was, that no nmeasiness need be entertained in the matter; there was no mistake; the words were really meant, and inserted advisedly. This being the case, the article in the Patric is the only matter for which the per.on who directs that journal is responsible.
			I have already mentioned that one or two of the persons implicated in the Carlist affair are nearly related to the Montijo family. What is near and dear to MIadrid cannot be indifferent to Paris. A message was sent off on Monday or Sunday last to M.adrid, requesting Queen Isabella to spare the lives of the favoured parties. Queen Isabella is said to have replied, that those who made this re- quest appeared to forget that she was a Constitu- tional Sovereign; that she could not take upon her- self to remit, any more than to inflict, punishment, irithout the advice of her responsible Ministers; and, moreover, that the parties arrested could not be considered as criminals until they had been tried and condemned by the proper tribunals. If this be exactly reported (and I am assared it is substan- tially correct), it is an answer which becomes a Coa- stitutional and an independent Sovereign.
			The SiMe publishes an article from the pen of its director, 3. Havin, which opens in this lofty style - "As a citizen, as director of a journal which is read every day by a milion of Frenchmen, we have the right, to give simple counsels," &amp;c. Ap- parently, the Si&amp;le thinks that the Government of trance is like that of Japan, of a twofold charac- ter-the director being probably the Mikado, and the Siagoon, who commands in war, being the Em- peror Napoleon IIL After having thus announced his quality and pretensions, he proceeds to give what so great a personage rather modestly calls his " simple counsels." He declares that "we aro in a state of transition, where we must consolidate what has been done before wishing to obtain greater re- s-i! ;" the French Government mast " accom- p5h. and consolidate the possessi ni of Lombardy by Piedmont, which was given her by France."
			"In the new States of King Victor Em- manuel the Piedmontese political law must be put in force; and liberal institutions must be practised." France must take care that this new :State, "which owes its existence to the power of our arms and to the will of the Emperor, shall not be disquieted by the counter-revolution which is agitating under every form." "I f the French Go- vernment speaks high and firm, all attempts at counter-revolution will vanish like an uneasy dream "` authority must not be given to General Lamorfci&amp;re to enter the service of the Pope, and (and this is the strangest of all from so ardent an advocate of liberty) the French army must be left at Rome " till the solution of all the problems which the Italian question stil offers," and the vSiMce ends by hinting that " the new complica- tions which are perceptible on the shores of the Bosphorus may facilitate our task."
			flaving thus delivered his " simple counsels," the Siecle fals back to its repose, satisfied with having done its duty. Some of these counsels have been already " whistled down the wind," as General Lamoricilre is authorized to regulate the Pope's levies. There are two things, however, in the " simple counsels' of MI. Havin which show the strange notion liberals of this Echool have of liberty; one is the demand that the Piedmontese laws shall be imposed on Tuscany; and the other, that the French army shall continue to occupy Rome. Now, the Leopoldine laws are considered to form an excellent code: the Tuscans were well
			eatisfied with them. Under them the Tuscans were once flourishing, prosperous, and contented. As for the Papal Government, it is much less discreditable to be protected by a native than by a foreign army.
			The readers of the Jeournal des Dlba1s will be sorry to learn that one of its most popular writers wiD no more figure in its columns. ML Prevost Paradol has ceased to belong to the staff of a newspaper which long held so high a place in the periodical press of France. The DJ)ats has changed a little since the death of Dt. Armand Bertin, who main- tained, tlhrough every difficulty, its independence and character. For some time past rumours have been current abouat the new lights which seem ara- dualy breaking in on the Dibats on domestic and foreign policy; and its expected assimilation to the Pays, CGotimtiontims, and Patrie is watched with curiosity. The dropping off of some of its inde- pendent contributors, wlho were so well known to the public, leads people to suppose that a moditica- *ion is in progress, similar to that announced in .he first lsine of Ovid's great work:
			"In nova f ert animus multatas dicere formas " Corpora."
			Nf. Prevost Parado's talents, however, though lost to the Debats, are not so to the Parisian press. Hfo becomes principal editor of La Presse, of which IN. Solar is the director, and his first article on Savoy appears in that journal this evening.
			A letter from Peath, of the 6th inst., mentions XZ follows:-
			"The Anstrian authorities, after a good deal of hesitation, appear disposed to attempt to carry out the odious patent of the st of September reLaflvo to the Protestant relgion. To facllitate the operation, they have resolved on dismissing the superintendents of districts (tho legal ecclesiastical divi- sion of Han iryi into eight districts or' superintendencies, and each has at its head an officer caled a superintendent), and already X Komaromy and M1. Toperczer, superin- tendents of the Pesth and Koesmark districts, have been dis. missed. Both are worthy men, distinguished alike for patriotism and for zeal for the Protestant religion. The foroaer has been replaced by a3 M. Walka, who is unknown to fame, and who from his name I suspect is either German or Slavonlan, not hragyar.
			"The Viennese journals at the bidding of the Govern- mnent are putting forth a statement which Is Intended to deceive Western Europe with regard to the feeling of the Xrotestants of this country. The statement is, that 306,786 Protestants, of 226 parishes, have accepted the patent, and that 543,712, of 333pparishes, havo refused it. Even if these figures were correct the majority would be adverse to thE patent; but they are fraudulent. They refer. not to thE 3rotestants of Harmgary taken en masse, but to a fractior of them-not to the Protestants of Mfagyar race, but tc those of Slavonic and German descent-not to thE 3,000,000 and more Calvinists, but to the SOO,000 or sc Lutheraus. The Vienncse Government is realy guilty ol Characterlstic meanness in endeavouring to pass off a part a the whole.
			r A new hardship endnred by the unhappy Hungaris-
			;t the hands of their Austrian taskmasters has to be re corded. When, years back, the Diet abolished feudal rights,
			,the Austrian Government undertook to pay the nobles tht indemnity to which thoy were entitled for those rights, and of counrse, It undertook to get back the money from the pea Bants; but, with its usual bad faith, the Anstrian Govern raent paid the nobles, not in cash, as it ought to have done but In trumpery scraps of paper, to which it gave an awfrll, long namo; and, at the same time, It extorted from thb peasants far more than it was justified in doing. Well �his paper the Government now refuses to receive I3 payment of taxes, and yet It undergoes a frightful depre clation. As a general rule notes or bonds given to th nobles as worth nominally 1000. can never be sold for mor than 67f0. in notes, and to tern those notes into specie cost the enormous sum of 37 per cent. ! Are not such proceed ings as these enough to madden any nation ?
			The Corps Lcgislatif, on resuming business aftei the recess, will occupy itself with the consideratioi of several bills to be presented by the Minister o: Commerce modifying the Customs' tariff. The firsl to be passed is that removing the duties on mato rials of first necessity used in manufactures. Thbi bill contains an amendment by which Euch mateL xlab imported in forelgnyessels am nLot to be taxce
			more heavily than those imported in French bot toms. It is expected that this amendment will satisfy foreign ehipowners, as they will by it be placed on an equality with Frenchmen.
			It has been calculated that there were 700,000 kilogrammes of pork aud hams sold at the ham, fair held on the Boulevard Bourdon, in Paris, during three days of last week. The hams most in demand were those from Yorkshire, which were all disposed of on the second day. Next in request were the Bayonne hams, and after them the Strasburg, Metz, Westphalian, and Bolognese. The cash received during the fair is estimated at 2,000,000F.
			The funeral of General Dien took place to-day. The religious ceremony was performed with great pomp in the Church of St. Louiis d'Antin. (weneralDieu was horn} in 1813, and entered the service, as second lieutenant, from the BElitary School of St. Cyr in 1831. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on the staff in 1834, and of cap- tain in the same corns a few years later. He was a young man of no ordinary energy, and sought servic mi Algeria, where he was remarked as one of the most enterprising and efficient of the staff officers. He there became acquainted with General, now Alarshal Baraouay d'Hilliers, who attached him to his staff. Captain Dieu, at a later period, served with Omar Pasha during the war with Russia. In company with Colonel Maagnan, who was afterwards LiXled before Sebastopol, he contributed powerfully to the gaUant defence made by the Turks against the Russian armies on the Danube and in the Balkan. Appointed to the command of a brigade in the army of Italy, his brilliant career was concluded at the battle of Solferino by a musket-shot wound, which was incurable. The brave General suffered intense pain for 10 months, but his energy was indomitable. From his kindheartednea3 he received from the soldiers the epithet of " le boan Dieu."
			M. Gaume, the author of a work called the Ver BRongeur, which made a great noise in France, pro- poses to publish a work in 12 volumes, to be en- titled La levolution. The various subjects to be treated are thus divided :-The Revolution, four volumes; Voltarianism, one volume; Cesarism, one volume; Protestantism, one volume; La Renaissaace, two volumes; its Propagation, one volume; its Application, one volume ; its Judges, one volume. The following extract from the pre- face will give an idea of the work :-" There are no longer two questions in EuroDe; there is but; one, and that is the revolutionary question. Will the future belong to the revolution or not ? All is com- prised in that."
			It is said that a new pamphlet is about to appear from the pen of an anonymous writer, to be called La Coalition; not a coalition of kinas against France, which the author regards as dead and buried, but the coalition of peoples, who, according to the ex- pression of the Emperor, turn their eyes when suffering towards France. It is said that the author of La Coalitioti malkes light of the treaties of 1815, which have a few more rents to undergo in order to become worthless rags, and he hopes that in future treaties the territorial position which is suited to France, and which she merits, will be assigned to her. The author, in faot, points to the enlargemeat of the future frontiers of France.

			TUSCANY.
			(ETRO3 OUR OWN CORRFSBONnl'I.)
			Hl"RKNCBi, APxIaI 7.
			The day before yesterday the Church celebrated the solemnity of Holy Thursday, an occurrence in which the Grand Ducal Court in olden times never failed to show before the Florontines, visiting, on foot and in State, the " sepulchres" at the various churches, aU decked out in black, esilver, and gold, and fragrant almost to suffocation with the scent of violets, waU and passion-flowers. The representa- tive of SardinianRoyalty, the Prince of Carignano, was confidently expected to comply with this pious and popular practice; but there has been some hitch between the civil authorities and the incor- rigibly ficleo and perverse Archbishop as to matters of form, which have induced the Prince to keep within doors, running the risk of wounding the disappointed multitude.
			[The Prince lives al alone in that vast and mas- sive Pitti Palace, inhabiting the so-caUled Tapestried Apartments (Appartaneutto degli Arazzi), lately modernised and fitted up for his reception, with the windows looking out upon the dense evergreen bowers of the Boboli garden. He seldom goes out, and is hardly ever seen. He is reported to be in poor health. Frequently, however, he walks along the covered gaUeries connecting the Royal palace, all across the river, on the Ponte Vecchio, and along the range of building of the Uffizi, to Palazzo Vec- chio, where he holds iong consultations with the Governor-General, Baron Ricasoli.
			The Prince has been greeted with immense ap- plause upon his arrival, and all who approach him exalt his bland affability and the consummate dig- nity of his truly Royal manners. But the Tuscans, whatever may be said to the contrary, would wish, not for a Prince, but for a petty Court ; they evince some disenchantment and mortification at the ab- sence of the pomp and ceremony with which their traditions of a Court are associated. The expected arrival of the King will, it is to be hoped, indemnify them for the dulness of tho present periodL IJn- doubtedly it was a mistake to put off the Roval progress to Central Italy, which could so well have taken place between the vote of annexation on the 11th of Ma-ch and the openino of Parliament on the 2d of April.
			As we have here a siraulacrum Regis, so we have alsoasemblanceof a Cabinet. Our former Ministers, Ridolfi, Poggi, Busacca, &amp;c., are aU in Turin, either as Senators or Deputies. Salvagnoll, who is both, still lives here, or rather lingers between life and death. But we have yet among us our Premier, or Governor-General, Baron Ricasoli, and, under him, directors of the various departments have been ap- pointed, Ministers in all respects but the name. Mlost of these, Nelli, Isolani, TLbarrini, &amp;c., were at the head of various departinents of the adminis- tration under the late Grand-Ducal Government. They are the "old men" coming forward again under a new order of things. The only qovus hwmo is the banker Sansone d'Ancona, a man of Jewish extraction, and, I believe, persuasion,who has been recaUed from Turin, where he was a deputy in the Lower House.
			A new provisional Government has thus been established in Tuscany, which will certainly last for the best part of a year, and may also bo indefinitely perpetuated. The solution of the problem of recon- cilingthe administrative "autonomy" of Tuscany with the union of this province with the rest of the kingdom presents dii3iculties which the present arrangement is more calculated to increase than to smooth down. Even the War Department, I am told, is to be intrusted to a special Director or "Regent" ("Reggente") as he is to be called. The oddest circumstance connected with this appoint- ment is that the officer designated for this task is said to be no less a personage than our late IiVnister, General Cadorna, who will stoop to a rank so much below the one he occnpied-no doubt for the sake of the public good. Up to this moment it seemed clearly understood that the an- nexation orfusionwouldbe entire and absolute,as far at least as the direction and administration of mili- tary affairs was concerned, but the choice of a func- tionary especially charged with the War IInistry, and the condition of the Tuscan Division under General Stefanelli, which is carefully maintained in its status quo, are all important facts, which give no little uneasiness to the partisans of downright, frank, and durable annexation. What is the real destination of Tascanyf For what Sovereign or for what State is it maintained in this srn'uin
			self-standing condition,? Surely this Is a mode of proceeding far different from that followed by the Sardinian Government in theEmfilha, where the work of assimilation, absorption, and regular fusion is going on with an alacrity proving the right good- will of the governors no less than of the governed.
			Piedmontese troops have occupied Tuscany, Tus- can troops have marched into Piedmont, but how can the Piedmontese look to Florence or the Tuscans to Turin for their central admministrative organiza- tiOu ? How can either Ministry keep the accounts of troop3 which are constantly shifting their quarters, and passing from the jurisdictlon of one into that of the other?
			Now we are looking into the accounts of the late Administration we begin to see to what awful ex- tent the Tuscan finances have been burdened by an almost incredible smount of vain and unprofitable expenditure. You have been told already that, ac- cording to the very clear and circumstantial budget published by the late Minister of the Finances, Baron Busacca, the expenditure of this Tuscan province must needs in ordinary years exceed the revenue by about 14,000,000 francs, though the total revenue of the State under the Grand-Ducal Government averaged between 32 and 35 millions of francs annually. lVhere, then, are the yearly additional 14,000,000 to come from? What was the remedy proposed by the ex-MTinister for the cure of this grievous disorder ? Why, the sale of t.he State property, valued by himself at only :35,000,000 francs-a sum to he absorbed in two or three years.
			UEnder these peculiar circumstances of financial distress, who can think without dismay of this ad- ministrative "autonomy," which implies a gradual and successive increase of expenditure, without any hope of a proportionate increase of income? Now, Farini in the dimilia, and the three Governments under him at Parma, Modena, and Bologna, have been as madly and recklessly extravagant in the outlay of public money as our Tuscan Ministers were. Indeed, I suppose anything like moderation or economy is incompatible with a revolutionary Government; but in the Emilia revolution is at an end, and things will find their own level there, if they ever find it in the other parts of the kingdom. In Tuscany the provisional state continues to be the order of the day, Heaven knows for how long, Heaven knows for what hidden deeply'political pur- pose. No present could be made to Tuscany more fatal than this separate administration. Her public debt is greatly increased; the number of her public officers is nearly doubled. Three Universities, a Lord-Lieutenant, a Governor-General, five or six Ministers, yclept " Directors," are aU persons, or aggregate of persons, whose keeping costs not a little. Large sums will be absorbed by public w'rks, some of real, others of very questionable utility. The army alone causes an increase of expenditure of 17 mlUions-more than half she total outlay of the State under the Grand Dukes. Can Tuscany bear all this? Is all this to last, or what are our prospects for the future? WVhat do Piedmont and France really intend to do For Tuscany, or how do they mean to dispoze of her ?
			The solution of this problem is now to be found only in the teeming brainsof the Emperor Napoleon and Count Cavoar. For the present rational beings Lre strongly inclined to suspect that the annexation of Tuscany to Piedmont has been accomplished only in words, and that the connesion, even such as it is, a meant to be, and will actualy prove, of no long

			SARDINI.
			(FROM OUB. OWN CORRESPONDM-T.)
			J2U.Ki.N, APRIL v.
			SAllDIAN PARLIAyENT-HOUSE OF DEPUTIES,
			Signor Zanolini, Vice-President, in the chair.
			The burial of General Quaglia, the President of the Chamber, by right of seniority, gave rise yester- day (Easter Sunday) to an affecting incident. The funeral was appointed, at ( o'clock p.m., and among the members of Parliament following the coffin the vast assembled crowd singled out General GaribaldL At the door of the church of San Fihppo more than 5,000 persons were thronged together. No sooner had the body with the chief mourners entered the sacred edifice tban, al of a sudden, a deafening shout broke forth from the assembled multitude. The cry was, " Viva Garibaldi! Viva Italiana P' The General, who was far from expecting this ovation, endeavoured to escape from it, by rushing into the church afterthe convoy; but the people closed around him, beset the church- door, and pressed so hard that it was with the greatest difficulty, and by dint of the strong exer- tion of the shoulders and elbows of some of his friends, that the General, relinquishing his former purpose, succeeded in disengaging himself ; he ran -fairly ran-for refuge into the neighbouring Pa- lasso Carignano, closely followed by the sovereign people, whom he was obliged to address from a win- dow, representing to them hov unbecoming it was to disturb the mournful ceremony which had caUed them together by any demonstration of a political character totally extraneous to it. The crowd then quietly dispersed.
			The order of the day this afternoon brought for- ward the continuation of the verification of powera. New discussions arose as to the admission into the Chamber of salaried officials, especially with regard to those who were in the enjoyment of offices which rendered them ineligible, and at the same time of dignities which did not disqualify them for Parlia- mentary honours. The whole point at issue turned upon this, that some of the deputies thought the electoral law so framed as to exclude from the Chamber persons who by their position as salaried ;employ6s might be thought more or less dependent on the Government, while others held that the mind of the legislator was, on the contrary, to secure seats in the House for public ser- vants, who, by their rare and special talents or acquirements, were calculated to bring light upon every variety of subjects laid before the House. It seems that the latter opinion was the provailing one, as the contested elections were almost in- variably approved in the end.
			One or twoelections were declared to be void and nul, because it was proved that a certain number of the voters who had appeared at the poll were analfabets, illiterate persons excluded from the suffrage by the electoral law.
			A few of the elections are still to come on for dis- cussion in the course of to-morrow's sitting. The TIouse will then proceed to the election of President, Vice-President, Secretaries, Questors, &amp;c. The Ministerial candidate for the Presidency is Signor Lanza, once the Minister of Public Instruction, then of the Finances. There is hardly any doubt but that he will secure the vast majority of the votes.
			The Avocato Tommaso Corsi has been appointed Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. He is a Tuscan, a man of considerable strength of charac- ter, and great practical ability.
			The King's journey to Tuscany is appointed for next Sunday, the 15th. His Majesty will be ac- companied by the Mlinisters, by many of the sena- tors and deputies, and by the diplomatic body-at least by the British and French Ministers. Prepa- rations on a grand scale are going on at Genoa to fit out a steam flotila for the Royal party; expecta- tion at Leghorn and Florence is raised to the most tranacendant pitch, and no trouble will be spared to give theRoyal progress through Central Italy all the greatest possible gcat. It is said that from Flo- rence the Royal decree will go forth, bestowing on the new united State the emphatic title of .fegno Italieo, or Begno dItalia.
			In the midst of these brave doings it is somewhat doubtful whether the discusion respecting Savoy and Nice wil be allowed to come on in the Chami- bers previous to the King's departure. Mly impres- sion is that the choice of the President and other officers will take all the available time, and that as soon as the House of De- puties is fully constituted Parliament will be prorogued till after the King's return. In the meantime the appeal to popular sifrage in Savoy and Nice, to decide by owi ou non on the question of annexation to France will take place on the 22d of this month, long before either the King or his Parliament can be back. By that time the Cham- bers will not feel greatly inclined to dispute the legality of the irrevocable plebiscite, and even General Garibaldi vill hesitate about moving a vote of censure against the Government,-a motion which, as utterly unavailing,would scarcely find a seconder.

			SWITZERLAND.
			I (FROM OUR OWN CO.9POFDENT.)
			Long before the great Power3 h' given any assuranceanay, at the moment we en they eeemed to have altogether overlooLed the Swrsa s-de of the i3avoy qiiestion, and only expressed their feeble and
			11tilos indignatioa �t the off-aind manner in wLEwh tha Emperor Fapoleoatook 1iMS "guaran-
			tees"-the Swiss were determined to take up the gauntlet thrown down by France, and, if neces- sary, to risk the chances of a war, in which, at any rate in the first instance, they could reckon on no support from any side. Sach a resolution of a smaU State of scarce 2,000,000 of people against a powerful empire, close to its gates, must seem little short of madness in a ehrewd and positive people, as every one knows the Swiss to be. Tue, it would not have been the first time that this dttle free people would have engaged in so unequa! a straggle; bat then Switzerland was for the most part a wild and alnost inaccssible country, while now it is intersected in all directions by some of the finest roads in Europe. Then mili- tary science was in its infancy, and a small number of determined men were often a match for large hosts; while now the art of warfare makes daily giaut strides, and what seemed perfect yesterday is antiquated to-day.
			How does it come, then, that in spite of these changes, which seem to deprive Sw.itzerland of many of the advantages which she possessed formerly in a defence even against powerful foreign enemies, this sober people should stil have con- sidered it possible to have some chances in meeting at any rate the first onset of the great French Empire until they could find some support from abroad ? Where did this confidence come from? No doubt, in the first instance, from the conviction that valour and love of independence is not incom- patible with cotton-mills and money-making,and that, if need be, there might be found Winkelrieds in the second half of the 19th century; but this conviction wonld scarcely have been sufficient in the face of an adversary provided with rifles and rifled guns, had there not been some trust likewise in a military organization which was calculated to make the most of this valour and love of independence.
			Although others might have thought Switzerland sufficieantly protected by the mgis of neutrality, held by all the great Powers in Europe, the Swiss them- selves, seeing daily examples of the sad fate of small States enclosed betweea powerful military nations, thought it wise not to trust entirely to foreign pro- tectors, but to do something likewise for them- selves. With France and her legions on one side, and Austria and her battalions on the other, this would have been a hopeless task. acad Switzerland tried to imitate the military organization of those large States, she would have exhausted her finances without ever being able to command a standing army sufficiently numerous to oppose, even for a day, what others mig,ht bring into the field against her. Instead, therefore, of exhausting their strength in an impotent rivalry, the Swiss took their own peculiar condition as the basis for their military organiza- tion.
			As a free country, Switzerland had no need of bayonetb at home, and no wish to engage in offensive
			ars; a standing army was, therefore a ruinous luxury, which would have weakened instead of strengthening the power of defence in case of ag- gression, against which alone military measures were necessary. Leaving, therefore, this hobby to its neighbours intent on annexation, Switzerland has concentrated her efforts on a general system of arm- ing the whole population, and organizing a militia system on a larger scale. The task was not easy, and well might the professional soldiers of the great military nations around scoff at the profanation of the sacred mysteries of military art ; but the Swiss would not be discouraged, and per- severed. The problem which Switzerland was thus trying to solve was not only of vital interestfor this country itself, but for aU " free and unaggressive " countries which might be called upon to defend themselves from annexationist neigh- bours; hence it may not be without interest for Eng- land herself. There is a considerable analogy in many respects between the two ; both are free coun- tries, havieg no need of bayonets for home service; both are industrious, rich, countries, which cannot afford to loose great productive power in an unpro- ductive occupation, and aggressive wars are held in equal horror by both countries. England, It is true, has her colonies and foreign possessions; she is a great Power, who has her exalted place to guard among the nations. This wiU always force her to have an army disposable for foreign service; but, in order not to make this necessity too expensive, a cheap and efficient s7ystem of home defence must be of interest to her. Without pretending that a system of defence invented for this country could be applied in its integrity to England, much may be learnt if the system has succeeded here.
			It is presumptuous to judge of the efficiency of a military organization before it has stood the test of a campaign, yet one might be allowed to draw some inferences on the general capability of the system if one has before one's eyes some grounds to go upon.
			A short sketch of this organization must precede, in order to understand the basis of the whole system. Every male inhabitant of Switzerland, unless physi- cally incapacitated, forms part of the militia. This latter forms two classes; tho first, comprising all those from 20 to 44 years of age, are liable to Fede- ral service,while the second, comprising those above 44 and under 20 years of age, are only called in for cantonal service. In cases of great necessity alone, and with their own consent, can they be ap- plied to service outof their own canton. The Federal army itself is again subdivided into two classes- the contingeat, comprising al men from 20 to 34 years of age, and the reserve, from 34 to 44. Both the contingent and the reservekeep up permanently their organization in battalions, companies of care- bineers, squadrons of cavalry, and batteries, with all their officers and non-commissioned officers. The quota of each canton in this organization is accord- ing to the number of inhabitants, and consequently according to the number of men each of them can furnish. The troops of each canton form, as it were, a body for themselves, with their own can- tonal staff. The equipment, as weUl as the arma- ment and accoutrement, of the troops are at the chargo of each canton, with the difference, how- ever, that arms are supplied by the Federal military authorities, and that the equipment is in some cantons procured bythe indivldualsoldler, while in others this is done bythe cantonal authorities. The contingent of each canton is called in ei ery year for a fortnight into barracks for "repetitions," the only exception to this rule being made by the first category of the contingent, the recruits who have completed their 20th year. These latter must re- main for six weeks in barracks, in order to receive their first military education. The reserve is called together for 48 hours a-year. Officers, as well as soldiers, as soon as they enter the barracks are paid and subject to an extremely rigorous military code. The canton defrays the expeuses of this yearly drill. Besides this thera are every second year for a month or six weeks Federal concentrations of troop3,usually one or more divisions. The expense incurred by this concentration, as well as that required whenever the troops are called for service out of the canton, is borne by the Federal Government. The cantonal authorities have the right to name their officers up to the rank of captain inclusive, the higher rankss being within the sphere of the Federal authority.
			For the concentration of this cantonal military organlization there exists a Federal Staff, which is inpermanent service and pay, and which has to superintend the general direction of the whole system. All officers and those named by the cantons must pass an examination, while those wishing to belong to the Federal Staff, as well as those belonging to the special arms, must pass through a regular course of studies. The Federal Staff forms at the same time a kind of war depart- ment, with a general direction of military matters, seeing that the existing regulations are carried out, and proposing such amelioration in arms and equip- ments as may becomne necessary.
			From thls short sketch you may be able to judge how smaU the expense is which the military organ- ization of Switzerland requires in ordinary times- the fortnight's pay and keep of the 3oldier and officer every year while in barracks, the pay for one month or six weeks of a couple of divisions every second year, the first outfit and arming of the soldier, and the keeping up of a sm,all Federal Staff. Equally small is the loss of time which this organization costs to the population-six weeks one year, and then a fortnight ever after, except once or twice durin the whole time of service, when called out for Fed
			ral concentrations and manoiuvres. There are few more industrious people than the generality of the Swiss, consequently, few more aware of the value of time. Every five years they are asked whether they wish for a change inftheir constitution. As no objec- tion has been raised against the burdens of the military service, it is presumable that they are felt very little.
			With this small sacrifice of time and money Switzerland is able to put on foot in less than a fortnight 119 battalions of infantry, 71 companlea
			of Carabineers, 42 batterIes of field artillery, S rocLet batteries, and 42 squadrons of cavalry, IS comDanies of sappers and pontoniers-in all from 110,000 to 120,000 men, provided -with all the mate- rial necessary for field service-a force which, in an extremity, might be well nigh doabled; and this force comes into the field fully organized as an army, the battalions, squadrons, andu batteries being collected, even in times of peace, in brigades and divisions, the latter comprising all arms of the ser- vice.
			That this constant eadiness is not an iUusion was proved in the Nenfechltel affair, where, in spite of winter, 60,000 or 70,000 men were at Basle in 10 days. One battalion of Geneva, for imstauce, which receivd the order to come into barracks on Friday, hadstarted on Monday, andwas fourdays after onthe opposite frontier. As far, therefore, as the quan- tity, readiness, and cheapness of the means of de- fence are concerned, there can be little donbt about the efficiency of the present system of military organ- ization in Switzerland.
			As for the quality of the soldiers thus supplied, I should not like to speak dogmatically, having seen only four battalions of infantry, two of carabineers, and one battery, but these troops were from various parts of Switzerland. I have seen them manoeuvring; I have had opportunities of judging of their physical and moral disposition;* and I have no hesitation in saying that they are, as a body, superior in some re- spects to most soldiers I have seen, equal in other respects to most, and only inferior in a few things to any Continental army.
			At this moment we have here the 84th battalion of Geneva, the 6th of Neufchatel, and the oSth of Berne, besides the 10th Carabineers of the Pays de VatLid, and the 25th battery.
			If any professional man, duly impregnated with the spirit of the martinet and corporal's stick, were to see the men walking about the streets I have no doubt he would be shocked at the unmilitary, almost clownish appearance of the single specimens of these popular soldiers. Not a traceoof smartness, shockingly comfortable blue capotes, indifferently made loose trousers and easy black cloth gaiters, the whole topped by rather ridiculous looking shakos, would fully deserve their reprobation. They have evidently no ideaof a movement of limbs with- out motion of the body, that great problem of standing armies. They push their shakos back from their foreheads if they feel warm, and even unbutton their coats; they tuck up their trousers into the gaiters when it is muddy, and walk about like any other mortals, but even the most prejudiced admirer of smartness could not help being struck by the size and squareness of these bourgcois soldiers and he would probably sigh that the Swiss know not how to use their splendidc material. Bat it is only when you see them in line that you per- ceive how splendid this material is. The battalions of Berne and of Geneva, especially, might bear in this respect a comparison with any corps d'6litc- nay, if strength and endurance are taken into con- sideration as well as size, an eye accustomed to judge wiU give them the superiority. The great majority are men and not boys; this wiiU be the impression on any one who thinks of standing armies.
			ane Troops inder arms here have everv day eight hours' exercise in battalions from 6 till 16 a.m., and from 2 till fi p.m. they are fully accoutred with knap- sacks, blankets, and even camp kettles, they have their ammunition with them, and look at them in the last quarter of an hour. I have loDkedand can tell you that most of them had scarcely turned a hair, which proves that they are in better condition than most of the standing armies. Above all, the Bernese seemed scarcely to feel that they carried a weight which oppDresses most other soldiers. It is true they carried It in their owfn way rather, but they moved about like people accustomed to it. Equally well did those of Geneva atand the hard test; rather less so those of Neufohatel, although even these latter might give odds to any other continental army. Something must be put, no doubt, on account of race and continual exposure at home, but I am sure that not a little is due, likewise, to the permission of using their muscles in a natural instead of an artificial way.
			What, then, my eye told me about the hardiness and power of endurance which such unsophisticated troops must possess was confirmed to me by ac- counts of the Neufohatel affair. In six weeks of a winter expedition on the frontier, with outpost duties and marches, one of the Geneva battalions, effeminate in COmDarison with the men of UJri or Schweitz, lost two men out of 800-one was con- sumptive before he went, and the lieutenant-colonel, who was ill when he started. So much about their physical qualities.
			But will these soldiers of a day fight, these men with wives and children at home, accustomed to peaceful occupations-a farmer here, a banker there, next a tailor, and beside him a greengrocer,- where is the link, the esprit de corps, to keep toaether these men, where the stimulus to impel them? Look at those determined faces and listen to their simple language, and you 'will have little doubt. They don't fight for crosses and promotions, and they know for whet they are fighting. They don't take a pleasure in soldiering, but consider it as a serious busiess which must b done. The cause for which they are fighting is their own, and every- one has as much interest in it as his neighbour, and this neighbour he knows. It is not as in standing armies, where men from all corners are placed side by side and must be cemented to- gether. EIere every one knows and lives 'with his neighbours, he is under the eye of those with whom his lot is to dwell and associate for the rest of his life. Besides this, there is the traditional spirit of emulation and rivalry betwveen the different cantons, and it would be strange if the Bernese who let him- self be shot down at Naples rather than give up his banner with the bear would not do more to keep up that symbol of his country in his own home.
			Physical strength and endurance, personal valour and esprit cl corps are much, but they are not nll against regular troops; there is the drilling, and certainly in this point the Swiss troops, as far as I have seen them, are inferior to regularly drilled armies. There is not that precision in their evolu- tions which would satisfy the eye of a connoisseur; but who ever saw a battlefield and did not recogniize the uselessness of those complicated movements, which fail frequently even on the parade-ground, and are utterly inapplicable in a real fight. But, if the troops I have seen here are wanting in that automaton precision, they seem to understand very well what they are doing-arare case in otherarmies; and if, as might be hoped, the commanding officers understand the strength and weakness of their troops, they will keep to a few single movements, which they can execute as well as any regular troops. If inferior in evolutions, the Swiss troops are decidedly superior in the use of their arms, which in these days of rifles is no small advantage. The rifle societies have done a great deal to educate people in this respect, and this education is taken advantage of in the formation of the army. There are 71 companies of carabineers, or about 7,000 men, all the best shots in a country where everyone has his rifle and practises. Only those who have proved themselves to be superior to the others are accepted in this body, which, in its specialty, has probably no equal any- where else. Besides this, the companies on the wings of each battalion are chasseurs, like- wise chosen for their efficiency in the use of their rifles, makiDn about 30,000 more proved marksmen well aware of their skill A new rifle, thoroughly experimented, has been procured for these latter. I have not seen the firing, but the arm itself is as handy as the Enfield, and about the same weight. Here are, then, almost 40,000 men more formidable in the use of their weapon than probably any other army can show ; the rest of the troops have muskets in the ranks, but most of them have rifles at home, and know how to use them, teo, as well as the bayonets which are fixed to them.
			Behind the Contingent and reserve are the Land- wehr and Landsturm, men above 44, who have their own rifles, which they used for years,-a not at all despicable reserve.
			From this sketch you will see that, although weak in numbers, the Swiss in a national war of defence would be no contemptible adversaries; above all, in a country which does not admit of a simulta- neous action of large masses of troops. There is altogether a great illusion in this respect, as everyone might see in the last war in Italy, where, after talking of millions of men, scarcely more than 300,000 met on both sides at the battle of Solferlno. These masses may ultimately tell in a long war, and in such a one of course 2,000,000 men, howeer brave, could not compete with 35,000,000; but, if they were forced to defend themselves against a first onset, I am sure the Swiss would be found eaual to the emergency, and people will cease to smile at their militia. WVhether they would find a leader who would make the most of
			this militia is a question on which one cannot judge. in nny army until the moment comes, which we will hope is far distant. A 10.
			While the great Powers are de'batingwithin them- selves what attitude they ought to take, and while the Swiss are waiting anxiously and impatiently for their declision, and are completely paralyzed by this incertitude, the French are continuing systematically to complete the annexation of the whole of Savoy. The process they use for this puraose reminds me very much of that of the spider-operating on th;e fly wrhich has been thrown into its wreb; the lower ext-remities and the legs are already spun in and are motionless, and it is only in the short feelers about the head t.hat one perceives from time to time a convulsive movement. WVhen- ever this takes place there is a corresponding activity in the long sharp claws of the spider, whiclh ends inaddng another thread to its web; every time the movement of the prisoner becomes wealker and weaker, its efforts more languid and despond- ing; a few moments yet and the spider can fix itself on the head and put an end to the agony of its prey.
			Indeed, this last moment is at hand. M1. Laity, once lieutenant of artillery at Strasburg, and novw Senator and Imperial Commissioner in Savoy, is charged with the final blow. On Saturday last he began his tour in the northern provinces. lre began with Annecy, went the neot day to Bonneville, was yesterday at Sallenches, aud will be to-day at Thonon. The municipalities and syndics, most of them members of the deputa- tion to the Tuileries, did their best to prepare e verything for this triumphal procession, which may be considered as tautamount to a taking possession of the territory which has been ceded. Everywhere great pains had beentaken by the municipalities, well seconded by most of the native cmptoy.sstillremain- ing, to prepareeverything for the reception. Flags, illuminations, reviews of the National Guard, and epeechifying were all comprised in the programme. As the tour was wiselv contined to the principal towns of the district, -which are not wanting in -warm adherents to France, the programme wascarried ont very decently, and no one can say anything against it. It is true the Piedmontese Parlianent has not spoken out, and the voting of the Savoyards is only to take place on the 22d; but this is no reason why MI. Laity should not take a trip to the moun- tains, as you or I would. Surely it is not his fault if the populations receive him en- thusiasticaUy ; aud if his presence makes Easter into a twofold holyday, it only proves how ,reat the desire of these populations is to belong to Fr.ance. Let the Swiss be furious on the northern and western shores of Lake Leman, and AL Veltli, the Swiss Commis- sioner, vent his indignation across the Arve, they can do nothing against the warm reception of the dis- tinguaished foreigner. Although every one knows that he is Imperial Commissioner for Savoy, he doos not abuse his power; nay, his delicacy altogether forbids him from making the slightest use of it. Hle would not think of interfering in the internal administration of Savoy; there are the municipalities and the native employ6s, wlho do their work- well. All he can do is to report of their zeal and devotion to his master who sent him, accept their hospitality, make speeches, and cheer the good Savoyards. H-e cannot help it if the country people, not able to appreciate this delicacy, consider his tour as a taking possession of their mountains aud valleys, and, un- mindful of the free voting of the 22d, consider already the whole comedy over. The Imperial Go- vernment of France has always respected the opinions of the populations-it is its strength and the basis of its power. It would never think of doing violence to the ideas of the good countryfolks of Savoy on this occasion. You will agree that AL Laity has made great progress since Strasburg.
			But all this does not hinder people here from being furious at what they consider a flagrant violation of the SatWs qtto, and as a means to take away the faintest shadow of freedom in the voting which is to take place on the 22d inst. It is, in their opinion, prejudging the question, and littlo different, except in success, from Perrier's attempt to raise the Swiss flag and make a demonstration in favour of Switzerland. 'The Federal Commissioner has telegraphed to Berne for permission to un- dertake a tour in Chablais and Faucigny, but it is not probable that such a permission wiU be given at this moment. It might lead to a collision, which the Central Government is stiUl anxious to avoid. But every one feels that Switzerland is losing ground daily, nay hourly; and yet there are no means of getting through the cleverly woren tight web, except by breakzing through it. If the French committed da,rant illegality,-such, for instance, as occupying militarily the nentralized districts-force would be opposedto force; but this is not very probable, and so the Swiss must look on without being able to do anything, and in the end they may bhre- proached with this forced inactivity.
			The irritation produced by this intolerable state of things is such that even those who are by no meams given to extreme opiuions would risk any- thing to see it ended. Yesterday the rtumour spread that the French Government had declared that if the Federal Council did not withdraw the troops concentrated on the fronitier of Savoythe neutral- ized territory would be occupied by French troops. The Federal Government was telegraphed to, and when the answer came that no such declaration had taken place there was almost a feeling of regret in the town and among the soldiers.
			What the feelng of these latter is you may judge from a circumstance which occurred the day beforo yesterday. In a conversation which Sir Robert Peel, who has been here for the last few days, had with some of the leading men, he suggested, as the best means of getting out of this situation, to send some troops as a protest into North Savoy, and to withdraw them again if, as itis probable, the French should likewise send troops there. The answer of Colonel Zeigler, who was present, was that he should risk being shot by his own men if he gave an order to retreat before the French troops.
			And one can quite believe that such an experi- ment would be rather hazardous, especially with the troops coming from the more out-of-the-way valleys. The Bernese battalion which is here at present offers a good specimen of them; and Swiss tourists, accustomed to the beaten roads, would be considerably surprised to find such primitiveness in the country, which most of them think they know thoroughly. With the exception of some who have been in foreign service, most of the men had never been out of their valleys, even so far as Berne. When they were placed in the railway at Thun they began to whisper to each other confidentially, and with a smile, that the thing would never go, and when, in spite of their doubts, the thing did move they raised their mountain shouts with a glee and pleasure which rather asto- nished the civilized inhabitants of Thun. The same doubts were entertained about the moving powver of the steamer on Lake Bienne, and the same shout greeted its success. Berne was, in their eyes, an earthly Paradise, until they came to Geneva, and when they were lodged in the Electoral building they thought that they had come into a fairy land of palaces. The illusion was undeniably strengthened by adistribution of bread, cheese, and beer. By some mistake in the arrangements, they had had nothing to eat the whole day; bat, instead of think- ing to complain of the matter, they thought the distribution in the evening an extraordinary treat of Genevese hospitality, to which they had no claim. I can quite believe that it would be rather diflicult to convince these simple-minded people of the value of a protest in face of French troops.

			AUSTRIA.
			(ir-om oim Ow. CD? irsroNrnEN.)
			VIENNA, AvRIL 9.
			Count Stephen S$echenyA, one of the most dis- tinguished members of the Hungarian Govern- ment in 1848, committed suicide in the lunatic asylum at Dobllng during the night of Saturday, the 7th inst. After the domiciliary visit which ha received on the 3d of MIarch, Count S. Szechenyi more than once expressed a fear that he should be arrested, but there is no reason to believe that the Imperial Government ever seriously thouoht of laying violent hands on him. For a' timo much vas said of the necessity for putting a stop to his correspondence with his feUow- countrymen, but he wrote to some of his friends on Saturday last. In the evening of that day two or three of the unfortunate gentleman's relatives were with him, but neither of tbem remarked anything unusual in his deportment. During the night, however, the proprietor of the asylum vwas awakened by the report of a pistol, and when he and his assistants went to the apartments inhabited by Count Szechenyi they found that he had shot himself in the head. When Dr. Goergen entered the room the Count was already dead, nnd it must be supposed that he laid violent hands on
			himself during a sudden fit of madness, as he left neither letter nor other document behind him. Thedeath of BaronJosika Is said to have made af very painful impresson on Count S. Szechenyi, who during the last few days of his life frequently complained of determination of blood to the head. As the enemies of this Government may perhaps assert that a pistol was purposely put in the way of the Eungarian magnate, it may be as well to observe that none of his weapons were taken from him, as no one thought that he was not of sane mind. It is probable that the deceased would have hared the fate of Count Louis Batthyani had he not in 1849 gone to Dr. Gcergen's asylum.
			Two or three days ago the Emperor called on the Archduke Albrecht, and tried to persuade him to re- turn again to Hunmgary, but his Imperial Highness respectfullydedlined to do what wasrequired of him. Men high in office any that no Archduke will be sent to Hungary, and, consequently, that there will be no Palatine. The state of affairs in Hungsr?disquiete the Imperial Government, and it now begins to find that Baron Hflbner was not in errorwhen he declared that it was " absolutely neces- sary" to make concessions to the inhabitants of that country. As Cabinet Councils are conti- nually held, although Count Rechberg is con- fined to his bed, it is generally believed that extremely importaut matters are now nnder discuEsion. But little is heard of the enlarced Council of the Empire, and that little is not very promising. In the majority of the provinces the Emperor will have no difficulty in finding the requi- site number of councilors, but the Hiungarians and Venetians are lik-ely to keep aloof. The Hungarian papers are not allowed to give information as to the state of the Protestant question, but travellers atate that the organs of Government now employ verygreat moral pressureinorder to induce the differ- ent communities to accept the Imperial patent. Fines are frequently arbitrarily imposed on the pastors who oEfer opposition to the wil of the em- 7111J6S, and in the Bars County a Calvinist Senior was arrested and transported to Maroth be- cause he refused to "co-ordinate" his com- munity in accordance with the 3Ministerial ordinance. "At present," said a Hungarian, a day or two ago, "we bear everything patiently, but if ever a favourable opportunity of getting rid of the unbearable yoke should present itself, we shall not fail to take advantage of it." The sum raised at Pesth for the distressed Croatians is said to be about 10,000f.
			The Venice correspondents of the Vienna papers speak of important reforms which are about to be made, but no one in Venetia pays the least atten- tion to the promises made by the new Stadtholder. An extension of the sphere of action of the Central and Provincial Congregations is under consideration, but the Venetians declare that they do not attach the least importance to the institutions in question. The Oeslerreichische 7eitung continues to assert that many Venetians willingly subscribe to the new loan, but it is perfectly weU known here that neither the Venetians nor the Hungarians wiUl have anything to do with it. Twenty-one inhabitants of the Southern Tyrol, who a short time since were arrested ror having displayed animosity to the Government, have been delivered over to the military authori- ties, and wiU probably be tried by a drum-head court-martiaL AL Kolb, a North German profes- Eor of statiatics, tells us that the recent war in Italy cost Austria, France, Sardinia, and Ger- many 450, 000,000 of Prussian dollars (about ] J0,TOO,OOOOOf.) Austria expended 166,000,000 of dollars, France about 190,000,000, Sardinia 48,000,000, and Prussia, Bavaria, Wurteumberg, Baden, Darmstadt, &amp;-c., 50,000,000.
			For the moment there is a lull in Bosnia, the Herzegovina, Servia, Miontenegro, and Bu]garia, but it is very generally believed that there wil be rerious disturbances in the course of the summer. The Servian deputation which has gone to Constan- tinople is said to have taken with it 300,000 ducats, with which to pturchase the favour of the Porte. Prince Stirbey, who was arrested in WaUachia on a charge of having illegally influenced some electors, has been set at liberty by order of the Divan.
			The report that an attempt has been made to take the life of the Emperor of Russia has now reached Warsaw, but it obtains little credit.
			It is believed that about 60,000,000fl. of the.Neow Loan have been taken; that is,48,000,000fL in money and 12,000,000L. in National Loan Bonds.
			It being Easter, we have been without either news or local papers for the last eight-and-forty hours.

			THE GRAND DUKE OF BADEN AND THE
			CATHoLIC CHURCE.
			The following is the text of the Proclamation relating to the Concordat recently issued by the Grand Dnke of Baden:-
			"Frederic, by the Grace of God, kc.,
			"At a grave moment, and one which inspires anxious doubts in many minds, I make use of my finest prerogative, and from the bottom of my heart I address words of peace to my dear people. Lamentable differences with the chief pastor of the Catholc Church in this country had led me to pa-ve the way for an agreement by direct negotiations with the Holy See. In acting thus I was animated by the Fbeucere desire of substituting union for discord, and peace and good- will for mutual resentments. After long and laborious -negotiations a convention vvas concluded, which gave hopes that this object would be attained. Bet I perceived to my deep mortification that the convention wvhich has just been concluded excited apprehension in the minds of a great part of my people, and I could not refuse to take into serious consideration the opinion of those who demanded that the advice of the constitutional organs should be first taken.
			" The decision of the secoud Chamber of my faithful States gave to thesa deman,ls an expression which foreboded a fatal struggle between my Government and the Chambers. The interest of the Catholic Church, not less than the good of the country, require that such a struggle should be pre- vented, and that the uncertainty as to legality whieh would result from such a disagreement between the legislative powers should be avoided. It is my firm wiiU that the prin- ciple of the independence of the Catholic Church, in the ndministration of its affairs, should be fully appUed. A law, placed under the protection of the constitution, wil guarantee a secure foundatfon for the rights of the Church. It Is in that law and in the regulations which wiUl be subse- quently appended to it that the tenour of the Concordat wili fnd its legitmate expression. In that manner my Govern- ment wvil do justice to the reasonable claims of the Catholic Church without swerving fzom the constitutional path; and the pubUe law of the country,coming out intact from a great trial, viUl receive a fresh sanction.
			" A duty which is equally clear obliges me to-day to speak to the church to which I myself belong. While faithful to the principles which onght to govern the rights of the Catholic Church, I shall endeavour to give to the umited Protestant Evangelical Church of tho country the freest pcsible development in accordance with its constitution. I desire that the same principle may bear fruit in other brsnches of the State, in order that all the parts of the whole may be united in a harmony vithout which mere freedom by law is unproductive of beneficent power.
			" I now exhort the tried patriotic and civic spirit of my people to forget all the differences which have recently been occasioned, in order that the concord and the tolerance which Christian charity teaches all may prevail between the diffo. rent churches and their adherents. Many dangers may threaten our country. Union alone gives atrength. Let no resentment remain on account of differences which should be a matter of the past, and confide in a future which will hurt no one, since it means to be just to alL

			ITHIB WEST IADIA AwD PACIFIC MATLS.
			SOUTHAMTON, Ta P.SDAY 1IORI'flG.
			TheBoyal Mail Company's screw steamerTas- manian, Captain R. Revett, arrived in tho river shortly before midnight with the abovenamed mails, being the earliest arrival ever known. She was due here, tnder the new arrangements for accelerating speed, E0 as to admit of letters by the homeward mail beina answered by the outward steamer on the 14th inst., and has consequently arrived within a couple or three days of her contract time. The Tas- manian left St. Thomas on the 29th ult., and ex- perienced light south-westerly winds during the voyage home. She had fine weather until the 8th, 9th, and 10th inst.; on the morning of the 10th she encountered a heavy confused sea, and two of tho boats were washed away from the davits. The dates of mails bv this arrival are as follows:-
			.'l V� PdZs6UUgenra among whom are the Hon. R. Temple, Chief Justice, from
			Belize; Major Armit, R.E., and family, and Assist- ant-Commissary-GeneralTlalassy, from Jamaica; the Rev. W. IV. Jackson, from Barbadoes, &amp;c. She has $327,191 in specie, jewelry value 1891., dia- monds and precious stones value 9001., and a cargo comprising 25 casks of coffee, 404 bags of cocoa, 1 seron of cochineal, 34 serons of indigo, 31 packages of honey, 52 bales of bark, 140 packages of general merchandise, and 41 live turtle.
			Our advices from Jamaica are to the 24th ult. The Legislature was called to meet for the despatch of business on Tuesday, the 27th, being several months in advance of the usual period. The special business of the session was to consider the proposed transfer of the Post-offica department to the local Government. " The feeling of the whole colony," says the ITamaioa Tribsne,-
			" Is unmistakably against it, but It is urged now that the iland Legislature have not the option of refusing. If this be the ease, then, of course, the question will be easily set- tled, but It is believed posaible that the Home Governmept may consent to retain the management of the department if the island wi guarantee to make good annuaUy any pecu- niary loss that may be entaUed, which we are quite sure the Assembly would be ready to do."
			The Morning osu-sal takes a contrary view, looks upon any such opposition as evincing a want of con- fidence in themselves, and says, " There will, no doubt, be considerable discussion, and there vwill be, perhaps, much heartburning on the part of certain members; but there seems to be no other alterna- tive than to accept the terms the Imperial Govern- ment have offered." In the parishes of St. James and Trelawney symptoms of insubordination were manifesting themselves, the people objecting to pay turnpike charges. A letter from Annotto Bay, datedhMarch 13, gives the followiing account of a mXiost extraordinary and alarming phenomenon which had occurred there:
			"Annotte Bay, March 13, 1860.
			"On last Sunday morning Annotto Bay was visited by a phenomenon unparalleled in the recollection of its Inha- bitants, but which, from Its analogy to the hurricane, I must place in that destructive clas7s of wind. Although the aioon was not distinguished by that transparency of atmo- sphere in which we are accustomed to luxuriate, yet there was nothimg peculiarly indicative of a disturbance of the equilibrium of this essential appendage to our globe; and excepting the light clouds that fantastically flitted about, the early part of the day was serene, until within a few moments teforethedevastatingrushof wind, whoseterrible career of a second Is too painfuUy marked by the ruins that now lay scattered around us, swept along the shore of the bay in a semi-circular form, convex to the Annotto Biver. Between the hours of 9 and 10 a slight breeze. impregnated with heat, from the south-west, quickly varied to the north- west, and freshened to a squall, which continued for aboot half an hour, and then subsided into a dead calm. In rapid succession dark clouds apoeared in the north-east direction, which became blacker aid thicker, and formed a deme atmospheric sheet of vapour, moving In fitful formations to the south-west polnt, in close pro nity to the shore. It accumulated and acquired specific gravity for its destractive purposes, and then, giving full play to the tendencies of its power, this mystsnous agent sent forth in spiral columns its mighty rushing element along the horizon, tore up trees by the root-the loftiest and minutest-aud laid in ruins buildings wlth their brick foundations, sending their roofs far into the air, and ultimately lodging them on the bosom of the Annotto Biver, and with its mighty whirl scattering broken furniture and tattered garments to the winds of HTeaven.
			" The loss of property is considerable. Mr. Bell's resi- dence was levelled to the dust; three houses of Mrs. Moore were demolished, one of which was occupied lately as the Custom-house. She is left, indeed, in a deplorable situatlon. Three women were in another of them in this awful visita tion, and were miraculously rescued from death. A horse tied to a tree in the same yard was dlscovered dead, and with great difficulty the rector's carriage horses and one of Mr. Delisser's were extricated from the ruins of a range of stables in Mr. Bell's yard. Another singular feature of this sad catastrophe was the removal of several smau houses from their base, without much injury, and the inTerse posi- tion in which two outbuildings of small dimensions were found.
			*The only vessel in harbour was the sloop Georgiana, which was to covered with the smoky vapour as almost to be unpereidved during its ravgags, and was in a critical situa- tion, being thrown at one time on her beam ends, suffering a fearful undulation by the agitation of the waves.
			*- The accompaniment of a his3ing sound, like that of the crackingproduced by fire, added horror to the affair, and induced the cry of fire from the alarmed Inhabitants, who ran about in wid consternation and led the police to have recourse to their rattles.
			"Up to this moment the atmosphere is quite unsettled, and we have had almost constant rain."
			The weather had, with few exceptions, been favourable throughout the island, and the public health was generally good. The markets had been somewhat unsettled by the heavy receipts of articles, which were in some cases overstocked. Operations had, therefore, been in a measure restricted, and business was dull, though prices had not materially declined. Coffee had not been offering in any quan- tity, and purchases had been made at 42s. to 44s., according to quality, the latter price being for grades suitable for tierces. Sugar ruled at 20s. for fair, and 16s. to 18s. for dark. American corn was very dull, the supply of home growth beiner plentiful. Sales of the latter had been made at 4s. 6d., and 400 bushels at 4s. 3d. per busheL The arrivals of cornmeal had been large, and stocks were heavy. One speculator, holding 2,000 barrels, offered the lot in one parcel at 19s., but it was not taken. Sales had been made at 19s. to lOs. 6d.
			but some holders were unwiling to submit to these prices. In flour every disposition had been evinoed to lowver the price, and large sales had been made at 35s. and 34s.,and (some 400 barrels) at 33s. On the 22d nlt. some lots were under offer at 34s.; but the arrival of the Rome from Baltimore, with dates to the 9th, showing a rapid rise in the article, it being quoted at $5 t5 o t5o , caused holders to demand higher rates, and the market became settled. Smith's brand was the only one inquired for in beef, and sales had been made at 53s. per half-barreL The quantity of pork at market was smal, and in the hands of a speculator, who sold 350 barrels mess at 11Os. Of the last cargo sales had been made at 9Ss. for mess, and 8Ss. for rump. Of prime mess 100 barrels inferior sold at auction at 60s. (in bond), and 20 barrels superior sold also at auction at 81s. American hams sold at OMd. to 10d.; five tierces in- ferior fetched Gd. York sold at Is. 3d. The last sales of Irish tongues were made at 64s. and 66s., and American at 50s. Of East India rice 300 bags, very clean, sold at 16s., while of ordinary quality 200 bags had been sold at 14s. 9d., and 50 at l5s.; 300 bags of Arracan sold at 13s. (d. Sales of pimento had been made at 3d. per lb. for a lot of 1,000 bags at an outport, and 300 bags at Jamaica. There was only one lot known of remaining in the island for sale, even at the above figure. The market was heavily supplied with codfish, and sales from late arrivals had been made at 15s. for tierces and 22s. for boxes. Ale- wives sold in cargo at 24s. Exchanges.-On London:-Colonial Bank, 90 days, s per cent. premium; 60 days, 1 per cent. premium: 30 days 14 per cent. premium.

			The Court of Policy at Demerara vwas summoned to meet on the 20th ult., and again on the 22d, but on neither occasion could a quorum be formed: The ship Whirlwind, aftera short passage of only 78 days, six of which were passed at the Cape of Good Hope, arrived on the 12th from China with 377 immigrants, of whom 56 were women. His Excellency the Governor, rsa.Wodehowe, the Hon.
			William Walker, Ms. Walker, and other ladies and gentlemen went on board to look at the new comeis, the arrival of Chinese women being quite an epoch in the history of the colony. The people were all in excellent health, and appeared quite cheerful and contented. Not a death occurred on the passage.
			Ir. Austin, by latest accounlts, was busy prepariun
			for other shipments, and it ;as hoped that the same good fortune would attend them as has attended the first. The Baya Gazette of the 23d says:-
			"The packet being due here, under the new ostal ar- rangement, at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, when the signal went up for a steamer at about 20 minutes past 4 a good deal of excitement prevailed, many persons bein - credulous as to the packet arriVing Eo true to time. A few minutes decided the point, the usual signal for the mail was hoisted, and soon after the Wye ran into the river. This happy arrival, of course, affords ample time to merchants and others to receive and reply to thelr letters, and it the same punctuality be observed on all future occasions, the new postal scheme wil prove a great benefit to parties in Europe as well as to resdents in this and other colonies."
			Theweather at Demerara had, generally speak- ing, been fine, although warm, with occasional sho,wers. The exporta during the fortnight have been :-Sugar, 1,092 hogsheads, 86 tierces, 382- barrels, 620 bags; rum, 677 puncheons, 192 hogs- heads, 90 barrels timber, 33,005 feet. On the 15th ult, a pilot tender, laden with stores for the barks New York Packet, Captain Young, and Honduras, Captain Smith, at anchor near the Light Ship, sprang a leak and went down at a distance of about four or five miles from the shore. The two captains and three of the boat'a people got into the rigging, but a young man named 'lhomas Scholes, a third- class pilot, got hold of a piece of the hatchway, and cheering the others with the assurance that if he got safe he would soon send them assistance, he struck out for the shore, pad- dling with hands and feet, and succeeded in reach- ing the river, when a boat put off aud landed hira. Captains Hall, of the Spectator, and M'Nabb, of the John Ferguson, immediately started in their boats for the wreck, and were just in time, as Cap- tain Smith was nearly exhausted. Scholes, although tired and injured from having been upwards of four hours in the water, did not make that an excuse for remaining on shore, but embarked in the boat of the Spectator with the others. He is a native of the colony, and the courage and coolness he displayed, aud the success of his efforts to save five persons from drowning, are not likely to go unrewarded.
			From Trinidad advices are to the 24th of March. Everything was quiet in pohtics, and there was nothing of interest to report in reference to public matters. Acdvices from the Spanish Main were very conflicting-one party declaring that the Constitu- tionalists were in the ascendant, and the other as Batlydenyingit. There hadbeenan arrivalof captured Africans by the Ceres, from St. Helena-190 men, 33 women, and 1 child. " The disparity in the pro- portion of the sexes" says the Trinidad Press " is very much to be regretted, not that we mean to state that it was in the power of any one to remedy the matter, but for the sake of morality. That this island suffers very much, in a general sense, from a paucity of women of every class, is a fact patent to the most superficial observer." The weather during the fortnight had been favourable for sugar- making, and cocoa had come in more freely than during the two previous weeks. Of the former article considerable sales had been effected, principally good refining for the English market, at $4, and casks $5. Grocery qualities were being held for higher rates, seemingly in expectation of American buyers coming forward; but the latter had apparently supplied their wants, and were not so keen or anxious in their operations. The en- thusiasm which existed a month or two previous had vanished, and the present operators were chiefly agents holding orders from England for good quality sugars,-not the first fruits of the season's prodace, which must necessarily be green and of an inferior quality. Prices were therefore not likely to advance. The last sales of cocoa were $13 50c. per fanega (llOlb.). After the arrival of the steamer bringing the news of an advance in thehomemarkets, holders were demanding much higher rates. There were no sales of molasses to report. The followving is a return of produce shipped to date :-To March 24,

Bread6tuffs and provisions were in light stock, and there was little or no flour in the hands of importers. The last sale of extra Ohio was at $8 75c., cash. Mess pork bad advanced, and was held chiefly by aparty who had purchased on specu- lation. Codfish was in large supply and dulL Tonnage was abundant, and rates were maintained at 2s.

			At Grenada the Legislative Council had had a short session of two days. The chief topic of dis- cussion was the conduct of Mr. Bincks, in refer- ence to the offer he made some time since of some "s pare Coolie labourers" to the colony ; but in a subsequent despatch to Mr. liortright, before he re- ceived any answer from Grenada, he stated that he had given the preference to St. Vincent, because It lies " nearer to St. Lucia, and has not yet received any Coolie labourers." This despatch was, at the re- quest of the Governor-in-Chief, communicated to the House of Assembly on the 13th ult., and called forth from the Hon. D. W. Gibbs, member of the Executive Council, the following resolu- tions -
			" 1. That, in the opinion of 'Ibs House, the despatch from his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, transmitted In the message No. 1 of his Excellency the Lieutenant. Governor, Is anything but satisfactory.
			" 2. That, considering that the cargo of Coolie labourer3 referred to in that despatch was voluntarily offered to this colony by his Excellency, and that in accepting that offer some of the most influential planters not only pledged them- selves to pay at once the chartered rate of passage-money, but any other expenses attending the change of destina- tion, there wa3 more than reasonable ground to hope that the services of the labourers in question would have been transferred to thls island, where they are so much required.
			" 3. That the course adopted by his Excelency in respect to those labourers is, in the opinion of this House, calculated to injure the cause of immigration.
			"4. That this House cannot, therefore, refrain from ex- pressing most emphatically the regret which it feels at the disappointment which the agricultural interest of this island hDa teen subjected to by the course pursued by the Gover. neor-in-Chief on the present occasion.
			"5. That a copy of these resolution, be forwarded to his Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies through his Ex cellency the Lieutnant-Governor."
			Fine weather prevailed all over the country. Mills, boilinghouses, and distilleries were every- where in activo operation and yielding satisfacto- rily; plants for future crops were in luxuriant ver- dure, and planters only wanted more labour to turn other advantages to full profit. The iisland was free from el1 epidemic disease, and fully sustained ite charaeter as the healthiest of the Antilles.
			From Barbadoes we learn that the resident engi- neer of the Water Company had commenced the laying down of the pipes for bringing water Into Bridgetow,n. An address from the MIayor of Pointe, h-Fitre, Guadaloupe, to the inhabitants, dated Mlarch the 3d, 1860, reproduced in the Bsrbadoes journals, shows the symApathy for the sufferers by the late fire which is felt by their French neigh- bours:b
			"Inhabitants of Pointe-a-Pitre !-The city of Bridge- town, Barbadoes, has just been the prey of flames; the disaster is immense. Let us show that Pointe-A-Pitre does not forget the past. Let asextendto this poorcityinruins, our sister in misfortaune, the fraternal hand of succour, as she did once so nobly to us. Rich and poor, let each one do his duty, and quickly. Misfortune hAs the right of requiring us to be quick in sending our atd. A subscription has just been opened at the ofice of the Mayor, and a committee ap- pointe of the towan coencil to receive your contributions fromehouse to house. The treasuer of the coucil will receive the subscriptions.
			"A. LEGER, Mayor."
			The House of Assembly at Barbadoes met on the 20th njwti, but the business transacted was unim- portant. At a meeting on the l3th therCouncil's amendments to the Bill for improving that part of the city recently burnt and for the bett,er security of the city against fire were taken up in the House of Assembly and agreed to, w.ith the exception of the one excluding lumber and wood (as well as coal) yards fromn that pert of the townu. The HouAse de- cided to ask for a conference with the Council on the subject, w^hich was agreed to by the hon. Board, and after the conlference, the Council adhering^ to their amendment, the question wvas'reconsidered by the House and the amendcment agreed to by a majo. rity of 11 to 10; the other amendmenta having been
			carried by a similar majority. The Bill receved tbe Governor's assent on the folloving day. The Hon. George Nelson Taylor, of Her Majesty's Council; Mr. Samuel Jackman Prescod, of the Rouse of As- sembly; and Mr. James Elder, merchant, had been appointed Commissioners under the Act for im- proving that pbrt of the city which was lately de- stroyed by fire, and for the better security of the city against fire. The weather had been rather dry durinag the fortnight, and the crop was proceeding vigorouly throughout the country, the yield ap- pearing to be pretty fair generally. The sugar was everywhere reported as very good. Several vessels had sailed with cargoes since last mail, and the quantities exported to date amounted to-sugar, 5,522 hhds. 426 tierces 801 barrels; molasses, 1,053 puncheons 2 barrels; rum, 65 puncheons 52 hhds 'There were several vessels in port loading, some of which expected to complete their cargoes in another day or two. During the fortnight there had been but two arrivals of breadstuffs from the United States, the Lucy R. Waring and the Vienna. Stocls had in consequence been reduced,while the consump- tion had increased, owing to the scarcity of native provisions. 430 barrels superfine Baltimore flour from Demerara sold at .t7:y. On the 21st sales were made ex Lucy R. Waring at $7-44,for Baltimore flour, $5 for Baltimore cornmeal, $2 20 for corn, and 19 1-16th cents. for butter. Two lots of mess pork from Demerara had sold at $21, and the only holder was demanding the same price in bond, but the advance had checked consumption, and caused the trade to purchase freely of prime mess (of which the stock was considerable) at $16 to $17, dutypaid. Codfish was in supply; last sale of Newfoundland at 3 56. Large mackerel and alewives were wanted. Exchange on London :-Bank bills, at 30 days, $485; 60 days, $4,S2i; 90 days, $480. Pri- vate bills, at 90 days, $475. Bauk bills on New York, 10 days, AL per cent. premium; 30 days, at par. 4 per cent. discount for private paper at 60 days' sight.
			A vote of 2001., to be placed at the disposal of his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, for the relief of the destitute sufferers by the fire at Barbadoes, had been passed by the Legislature of St. Vincent's. Notice had been given of a Bill to establish an in- land post, and of a Bill to alter the appointed meetings of the Legislature.
			At St. Lucia the weather was fine and sugar- making progressing rapidly. The canes were yield- ing well. Fine showers for the young plants. Tonnage abundant, at 40s. per. ton free alongside. Provisions and breadatuffa of all kinds plentiful and cheap; codfish more so than for many years past. Exchange-Bank bills, 90 days'sigbt, $480; 60 days' sight, $482i; and 30 days' sight, $85. Purchasing at 90 days' sight, $475.
			The freight market at St. Thonas's was active, and the supply of ships not equal to the demand.

			THB PACIFIC.
			Files of the Panam Star and Herald to the 22d of March have reached us by the WestIndia mail steamer Tasmanian, arrived at Southampton.
			The steamship Bolivia, Captain lill, arrived In the bay at 10.30 p.m. on tho 20th with dates from Valparaiso to the 1st, Calao the 12th, and Paita tbe 16th.
			Chi remained quiet, and basiness appeared to be lm. proving. The railroads were progressing favourably, and a few miles more of the Valparaiso and Santiago road would goon be opened.
			Advices from Copiapo announce fresh yields In the Cha- narciUo silver mines and the prosperous condition of all the works. The copper mines of Ojancos, Cerro Blanco, and, above all, of Desierto, were very rich, and there was a great stock of ores in Chafiaral and other points. The works of the gold mines In Inca were acquiring Importanoe, and a great discovery was spoken of in the frontiers with Bolivia- Another very important discovery had been announced as having taken place in the Andes, on the mountain caUed Cuunquen, in the province of Aooneaguc, where it was said that more than 80 petitions had been presented in a few days.
			The news from Aranco is satisfactory. According to the Correo del Surf, Concepcion newspaper, " Peace is com- pletely re-established among the Indians of the lower fron- tier. Colonel Barbosa has obliged them to give him hostages, to pay a compensation for the ravages of the war, and construction of a fort on their lands in the neighbour- hood of Imperial." A meeting vwas to be hed for the defi- nite settlement of this affair on the 25th of March. This was no' the case, however, wlth the Indians of the upper frontier, who preserved their hostile attitude. A band of 2,000 of them made an attack on Fort Negrete, but were driven back with great loss by the garrison, consisting of 100 men and one piece of artlllery.
			During the fortnight ending on the 29th of February the Valparaiso market had been active, more particularly the last few days. Articles of exportation, bar copper, regulus, and ores occupy the first place; while bar silver, barley, hides, &amp;o., come afterwards. The late news of the advance in copper in the European markets has imparted a consi- derable degree of activity to this article. Exchange on London, 44d., to 44Wd.; Paris, 4E. 65c. Freights.-Liver- pool, 3l. 10s. to 31. 15s.
			From Peru there is nothing of importance, beyond the rumours of Castilla's invadon of Bolivia.
			The Peravian ship J. F. L., which left CaUao for China, ad the Sandwich Islands, foundered when two days out and 300 miles from land; she was going at the time the leak was discovered about 7. knots. All hands immediately took to the boats and were unable to save anything. One boat with four persons and another with nine succeeded in reaching the coast of Peru, in the neighbourhood of Lambayaque, after being out three days. The other boat with nine per- sons on board had not been heard of. Among those on board was Purser Belknap of the United Statee' Navy, botnd to the Sandwich Islands on Govermment business. He lost everything, including $3,0 in money and ali his despatches, and was obliged to return to the States for dupli- cate orders.
			A letter from Paita, of the 16thMhrch, says
			" Political affairs in the South are rather unsettled per last accounts. General liobles, ex-President of Ecuador, is in Piura, receiving marked attention from the inhabitants. In Gmayaquil the disike towards General Franco is every day increasing."

			The files of the Gibralear Chronwdc received by the Indus contain very little from the late seat of war in Morocco. The following are the principal items:-
			" Amid the confiicting reports respecting the engage- ments of the 23d ult. between the Spanish and Moorish forces, and the excitement of the public in Spain on the peace question, tho f ollowinog extract of a letter dated Camp Toetnn, April 1, fiomu one of Spain's meat gallant and most distinguished generals, may prove of some interest:
			"' The battle of the 23d WaS, indeed, very hotly con- tested. The Moore defended themselves with desperate fury, hut they were forced to yield before our well-trained and disciplined troops. The losses on our side bear testimony to the resistance of the enemy; 120 chiefs and officers end upwards of 1,020 men were put hors dc comsbt-more than half of them (57 officers and 556 men) belonging to the eight battalions under the command of General Prim. .... The result of this last defeat of the Moors has been peace, and be it welcome. The honour of Spain, our dear country, is secured without humbling the vanqushed. It is not humbling them to require just compensation for the expenses of the war.'
			"Moorish commissioners had arrived in the Spanishcamp before Centa for the purpose of arranging with the Spanish authorities the new oundary line to be established in con- formitv with the treaty oE peace
			" The Moorish loss in killed and wounded in the battle of the 23d nlt. is stated at between 400 and 430.
			"Accounts received from Tangier on the 4th mention that on the 23d, the day the armistice and preliminaries were signed, a reinforcement of 5,000 men of the tribe of Rhamas (between Totn3n and the Rift) 0oined the Moorish eamp; and thatbon the 2Sth an additional force of 12,000 Riffians arrived and encamped on the eastern bank of the Bvoesfia, between Tetuan and Mtartin. The Ruffians are commanded by Hlamrish and Oolishky, the most powerful of their chiefs.
			"Sanguinary as was the battle of the 23d, it Is probable that if the warhad gone on and victoryhad continued to attend the Spanish arms, success would at every step have been more dearly purchased. The recent accession to the Moorish armyiseven moreimportant than its numerical amouni would indicate, for it consists of the fiercest and most war- like tribes of the empIre.
			" An Imperial order had been received at Tangier for the public execution of the two men implicated in the late mur- derous attack on Mr. James Drnmmond Hay and the crew of the bark Znlelka; and Sunday last was fixed for carrying the order into effect. Early in the afternoon three colonels of the Sultan's Bokhara Horse arrived at Tangier for the purpose of seeing their Royal master's order duly executed. E:scorted by a numerous military guard, end heavily fet- ters:i, liseunehappy criminals were soon afterwards led from
			market-place, and, a space having tn e midst of the dense crowd which had assembled there, a party of soldiers with loaded mnskets were drawn up wvithin it, and prepared to discharge their terrible duty. These preliminaries had scarcely been com- pleted when further prooeedings were arrested by the arri- val on the ground of Mlr. Reade, Her Majesty's Consul, accompanied by Messrs. James Drammond Hay and Green. Mr. Beade had been instructed by Her Majesty's Charge d'Aflhires to state that, although the prisoners had been found guilty of participating in the murderous attacks which had led to the death of tho unfortunate mariner John Storny, it was doubtful whether either of them was the actual perpetrator of the murder, and there- fore at his intercession, Her Majesty tho Queen of England bad been graciously pleased to direct that his Majesty the Sultan should he moved to commuto the
			death for that of imprisonment for a ned rm. He requested, therefore, that the authorities would abstain from giving immediate execution to the Sultan's order antil a reerence had been made to His Majesty. After some demur on the part of the authorities this request was acceded to. The natives, who had 'locked in great numbers to the market-place as long as they were under the impression that the execuion was abou t to take plae, showed, by their silence, their apprecia- tion of the justice of the sentence. They, however, groeted with loud shouts of satisfaction the announcement that the lves of the nfortunates had been spared, and poured hles- sings on the English for their mercifui intercession.
			" Accounts from Tetuan, In the Heir Steel, state that at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of the 25th, after signing the pre- liminaries of peace, the conditions of which are unknown, the Spanish troops bega to retire, as also the Kabyles. At this juncitre a singular incldent occurred, which to any one would appear a notable phenomenon worthy of attention. The MIoors retired between the Spmlish troops as if nothing had occurred, carrying their esinrgordees and other weapons, wrhich none w ersewilllng to sell at anyprice. M any of them encamped during the night with the Spanish troops, and on the reveille being sounded at daylight the MEoors began to dance at the sound of the music. They messed with the soldiers, and afterwards assisted in burying the dead of both armies which yet remained on the field."

			fTE TU2BB LICENSING BILL
			A publio meeting of beer-retailems and othen was hel6 yesverday in the London Tavern to consider the be.d meana of suPporting the Government in the above measure. MIr. Aeshmore, the chairmen of the Beersellers' A 0ciation, wsg cadled to the chair.
			The CIIsII observed that the greatest enemies to the proposed measure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer seemed to be the licensed victualers. The arguments ad- duced against it wero similar to those urged by them against the Beer Bill,-that it would tend to increase crime and de- bauchery. In additlon to which, it would tend, they allege, to injure their special intezests, in sepport of which, and to give importance to their class, they state them. selves as representing 63,000 of the community. Now, the beersedlers, the seaeker alleged, repre-ented 40,000, and, In asawer to the'various charges that had bee brought agrinst their conduct by the former class, he proceeded to quote the evidence of the Parliamentary Committeeof 1853. In the town of Norwich there were 5G0 licensed houses ana 70 beershops. Ont of the former 110 had the licence to seli spirits, and preferred not to do so, but to remain open aUl night. lThere were also a large number who paid a guinea for thelr beer ikences. In GreatYarmouth, ontheevidenco of Mr. Palmer, thero were 182 licensed viotuallers and 50 beerhouscs. The magistrates were the owners of many of the former, and several of them only appeared on the bench on the licenslng day. In ?Eanchester there 'were 435 licensed victuaUers and 1,533 beersellers; and the disproportion was accounted for by the demand of the publio for accommedation which in that place could not bo sup- pressed. In 1856 by the police officialreturns. 75 robberies were committed L the licensed houses and 29 in the beer houses; and these he continued, wero the houses the pro. prietors of which denounced them as being maintained by thieves acd prostitutes. In that room he saw more than 20. beersellers who pay more than 601. of annual rent. H1e could not think that these were al disrepu't
			able. There were, again, 10,000 of the licensed sic, tuaelers whose annual rental did not reach 10.; still it Wmas alleged that the character of the former householders could not bear scrutiny. He had no fear of the interests of the beerseller in London, as it was well Inown since the introduction of the Beer Bill that crime had decreased one-third in the metropolitan distrlcts. In regard to the proposed Wine Bill, it was not, ho consi- dered, what it might have been, yet it was the entering of the thin end of the wedge in tho overturn'ng of a huge monopoly.
			MIr. CooLE:Y moved the first resolution:-
			"That this mecting, vieving Mr. Gladstone's lte6roobentHAouaA and Wine Licenses Bill as an cppeoxinmaton to the oDpinon of tha eeleascomlrtte of IS IL do onsider it as foLy doareving the supperS o. a11whofeel that tho publc are be3tccrsedby ths ecoup3tiztoa which free trado originates and eneo uraeea
			Seconded by Mir. BsvicI, and carried unnnimously.
			Mr. H. Mssox strongly denounced the present licensing svstem. In reply to n vueatien put to the Chslnaregad- ing the interprebation or one or the cl_uses of the Bill sast
			whether or not beer-sellers would really be broulght within the scope of itS. operation, be remarked that he had comn- mussicated with the Chancellor of the Exchesuer on thia point, and had received thefoliowing saisfactoryreply from his secretary -
			" On the sublect of beersellers balsg allowed to talm out the now wine lI_enona I have to atate that Mr. Gladstone Icussad not to make sny proposl in conjunccton with wine lioense which Ehould alter the poeeltlon of beerhous-Le., drskingLhowue where beer is aold. Mr. Gladstone's propoal wil be oonfined to eatingbhouses, and ho Is not aware of havlng suade any promise to disble any eatIng-hours tronm sellingvins and beer together.'
			He concluded by moving the second resolution,-
			* That the opening and extesdtug the salo and onsumption of wtues will, inthe oplaion of this mneetng, produce a else of refreshmct. rooms that wil aaford greater fac_ltiss than now exist for peeons when tr,vellLng, or atother times, and equaly eDgilhe forfemaias, as afford, lag healthrul and eOnoomical refrehmeut."
			Seconded by Mr. SEDG.LY and carried nunnimously.
			The third resoluton was moved by Mr. W=Sr, ana seconded by Mr. IIALL, and carried unaimously,-
			" That ahut out as the baesrEaers have been by tho parta and capri, colns exercLse of the magiteral liensing ryrtru from improTinc their pottluon In Ilg, howgever eligble their premnsee, howuesr lanO they may havo been In the trde, or however wel they mnay bhae cos dustedthelrhouns they cannot utIthallthisaealuse with e&amp;dato-.

			It was next proposed and adopted that a petition be pre. sented to Parliament on Thursday; first, praying:-
			" That as, in the opinion of the petltloners, the lioeiding of retsllr
			of beer throughout the kingdom, and mere especially in tho larger touv, would do more to bring the asla of wise. into gneral consump. tion among the people than any other clues created for tho sale Of wines only, as it is to such houses that the working man generllg resorts to take his meals, they respectfully submit that when nclh aseeamodatlaon i Drvlded, and a refreshment mce 'taken out, the heerseller should be entUtledto take out a wine licaece the same a an ordloary eatlng-house."
			The CHAiRMAN, seconded by Mr. BFSwicir, moved a vote of thanks to the country delegates from the larger northern towns, who had urged the consideration of their common Interests upon their various representatives in Par- liament. They had formed themasieves into deputations and wsf.ted upon members personally.
			The meeting terminated with a vote of thankss tio the chairmnu, and with the signing of the petition.

Shortly afterwards she wvas seized wilth violent vomiting, and on her mother inquiring the cause It was discovered thLat arsenic bad been placed in the cupboard unknown to the sufterer, and she had taken it Instead of sulphur.

			M31,TPARYA AD WAVAL INTBLLIGENCE.
			'Ths foLowing Important circular has jus' been issned from the War-office, by order of the Secretary of State for War:-
			" Mr. Secretary Herbert desires tnat the particular at
			tenteon of all the engineer officers should be called to the necessity of exercising the strictest economy of the public fund, in the design of works and buildings for mUitary purposes.
			Cases have been recently brought before him where the provisions of the estimates submitted to the War-office have neen so excessive that they must have been prepared by in- experienced subordinates, and forwarded by commanding engineers wvithout consideration or study.
			'Bsuch designs are, it Is true, submitted to an examina- tion in the War-office, and a reduction is thereby often effected; but the effects of such revision are often arbitrary
			nd unsatisfactory, unlike savings effected by of ficers who nre thoroughly masterng the requirements they have to fulfil, and who feet them in the most skilflr and economical eanner.
			" There is reason to fear that tiese are engineer officers who consider the dcty of desdgning beneath their notice, ad who are too ready to place in the hands of subordlnates *dties which engineer officers in most other services in Xurope perform unassisted, and which are reaLly amon g the highest msuntions of the architect or engineer, be he military
			" It beine' considered that miLitary works ought to be designed by' military men, in order that military require. mients may he fuLly attained, it is mos3t iLlogical to place their duty In the hands of the civil branch of the depart- ment when there are miitary officers available.
			" Mr. Herbert does not allude to the works of fortifica. tions, which on account of their magnitude it has been necessary to make special arangements to carry out, but to the fulfilment of the numerous current services for barrack- etore and general purposes, amounting in the aggregate to a very large annual sum, which aro executed from the designs made at the head-quarters of each engineer distinct.
			" Mr. Herbert wishes that the designs for new works should, whenever It is practicable, be prepared by an engi- neer officer whose name shaU be attached to the design. When it is necessary to employ a civi member of the de- partment he, also, shall sign the plan, and have the full share of responsibility which attaches to the designer.
			" The person employed should consider carefully what is she object to be attamed and the means of attaining it; he .hould compute the number of persons, or quantity of traffic or stores for which he has to provide accommodation, and subordinate not only the dimensions of the different parts, !but the degree of solidity, permanence, and finish given to tshem to the object in view. He should carefulliy consider the origin of the proposal, and whether he cannot avoid a new coostruction by the repair, restoration, or appropria- tion of souse existing building. The Secretary of State for War will always be glad to consider such proposas if made
			wihcare and deilberatlon.
			"A few instances may be quoted wherein, from no want of professional skill, but rather from want of preliminary tho,,ght and consideration, considerable unnecessary expense has been incurred or proposed.
			" In a recent instance a bridge was recommended across the moat of an obsolete fort, when a causeway of earth would have answered every purpose. A drawbridge, of a size and strength equal to the traffic of the entrance of a fortress, has been constructed to an insignificant coast- battery.
			" The bridge may have been faultless as a bridge, but the hrst thing to determine was whether it was indispensable, or whether It could not be replaced by some cheaper, but equaUy useful expedient. A jetty was required to shin nmmunition from a magazine, the conditisns being that 3,220 barrels and cases should be put on board in six hours. Railways were in use at the magazine in question, and the trucks running upon them each carried 20 cases. There were, therefore, 11o truck-loads to be conveyed to the head of the jetty and to return empty In six hours, or one truck. load every two minutes. To accomplish this it was pro- posed to construct a jetty to carry six double lines of rails which would have given an overage traffic of one truck every 12 minutes on each line. One double line of rails was found ample, and the work has been executed for one- seventh part of the original estimate.
			" But when the proper plan and dimensions are arrived at care and judgmaent are required in selecting the most suitable material, and applying it in the mode best calcu- lated to attain solidity at as little cost as possible. it is often bad economy to build in too temporary a manner, but the converse is also true. It may be cheaper to build every 10 years in wood than to sink a large sum in stone. The best materials should be provided where they are required, but It is quite proper to use inferior materials when they will answer the purpose as well.
			D r. herbert does not wish absolutely to proscribe orna- maent, but it should be nsed sparingly and with judgment, and never cause any sensible increase to the cost of the build- Ings. Heavy cut stone dressing, cornices, and plinths sel-
			dom make an addition to the appearance of a building at all' commensurate with their cost.
			"High finish or expensive fittlngs to the interior of any I part of military buildings are stiU more to be avoided, and nre out of place in a profession where simple and frugal habits should be encouraged among all ranks.
			Euglneerofficers should endeavour to make the case their own, and do for the public service what they would do for themselvesbhad they to find the funds.
			"Large as the public revenue of Hler Majesty is, it is the
			heunden duty of every citizen, and, above all, of every 1 officer In Her Majestys pay, to snake the revenue go as far us It can.
			"Mr. Secretary Herbert feels confident that many officers of engineers do give him the assistance he requires, and all can If they will only make the attempt. Mfr. Hierber-t some- imes bears as an excuse for costly work that 'itis neces-
			to do credit to the service, but he Is not prepared to give credit to any ofificer for an injutdldious application of the means placed at his disposal from the public purse.

			HBE MAJESTYS TRBATRE.
			'xiie opera ot L-a favrosita, if given ecundumprt;.tionem,I seldom takes less than four horns irP performance, and yester- day evening, when it was produced for the first appearance of two new slngers, there wasno departure from the ordinary role. Midnight was close at hand as the curtain fell on the catastrophe that reconciles the chivalrous Fernando to the dyingand repentantLeonora-thetermination of a dramatic scene which, while competent anthority assures us it cost only a few hours to write, is not only Donizetti's best, but one of the masterpieces of modern Italian lyric drama. The new singers (new at least to thi5 country) were Madame Borghl-Mamo and Signor Everardl, to whom were respectively allotted the parts of the "Favourite" and the King of Castfle. At pre- sent wo can only say that both were eminently and very deservedly successful; that Signor Mongini, who undertook the character of Fernando, in consequence of the indisposi- tion of Signor Giuglini, raised himself to a position not hitherto accorded him in England, and which satis- factorily accounted for his continental reputation; that Signor Vialotti was excellent as the monk, Baldassare; that Mademolsellepocchini,in apasdcdeuxwith MLDurand,gave such gcdat to the ballet of the second act as to revive the memory of Carlotta Grisd; and that the opera, Mr. Benedict presiding with his accustomed ability in the orchestra, was generally performed In a highly efficient manner, the audience repeatedly expressing their gratification with a warmth that must have been highly flsttering to the amour propre of the artists. We shall retrn to the subject very shortly.

			ST. MABTIVS HALL,
			A series of chamber concerts for the performance of the works of the great masters, the principal artists engaged in which have been Mr. Willy, one of our ablest and most experienced violinists; Mr. Weslake, also a first-class player; Mr. Webb, a professor of the viola, with very few rivals in this country; Messrs. Pettit and Reynolds, violon- cello and double-bass, both practised performers; and Mr. Maycock, who, as clarinetist, stands nearest in position to Mr. Lazarus, was brought to a termination on Wednesday night, with a programme so good as to merit citing in extCenso:-
			PART L
			Grand Otteito. In A op. 32 for violin,
			two volhs, volonoelo, contre-basne
			d3amnet, and two borus Spo-r.
			omsnza- In Sogno" - Mreadante. Trio, in s flat, op. 11, pianoforte, claei-
			net, asd violoncello .- .. .. Beethoven. Cavatins - "IsAmor suoe (Roberto
			Devereu) -Donizetti.
			PART If.
			Sestetto, in F sharp minor. op. 8, piano-
			forte, two violins, viols, violoncelo,
			and contra-bauo .. .. .. .. Pro. W. S. Benme:t. Tyrolese" Tyrol, my Fatherland" . . Pauneron. Ballad-" The Reaper and the Flowers" Balfe.
			Quintet. op. 25, in G-- The Allegro I.. Onslow.
			In the course of the four concerts comprised in the series a great number of interesting compositions have been pro- duced, and among the rest some agreeable novelties in the shape of revivals, the execution of which by Mr. Willy and his talented associates elicited the unanimous praise of connoisseurs. Vocal music, intrusted to the best singers, has been a feature of eachsuccessive programme, the pianoforte being allotted an equaly important task, whether as a solo instrument or in concerted music, a per- former of eminent ability presiding on every occasion. There has been a little too much of Onslow, a composer at the best semi-classlcii; but as Onslow has written several q*uintets in which the double-bass is caUed into request, this partiality in his favour is readily explained. The Allegro, placed at the head of the concert on Wednes- day night, is from one of his most deservedly admired pieces. In Spohr's Ottet the representatives of the stringed quintet and clarinet were assisted by Messrs- C. Harper and Mann, to whom the horn parts were intrusted. Beethoven's trio (the " Clarinet Trio"-so called) is one of the most fresh and genial inspirations of its gifted author. The combination of the pianoforte, clarinet, and violonceUo is extremely happy; and so great a master was sure to put it to the best uses. The prominent attraction of the evening, however, was the rarely- heard Sestet of Professor Sterndale Bennett, which, composed as far back as 1836, is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the term. Every one of the four movements is remarkable in an equal degree for original invention and ingenuity, the ideas flowing with a spontaneousness only matched by the artistically felicitous manner in which they are treated. Messrs. Willy, Wes- lake, Vebb, Pettit, and Reynolds deserve credit for resuscl- tating a work the comparative neglect of which can only be laid to the account of the many diffliculties assigned in the score to the planoforte-difficulties which lie within the grasp of none but wholly exceptional performers. In asso- ciating themselves with Miss Arabeola Goddard the members of the London Quintet Union selected one who, more fre. quently than any contemporary artist, has essayed the con- certos and other lmportant works of Professor Bennett in public, and who is, therefore, intimately conversant with their style. That such music, when played as the composer intended It to be played, is sure to deiUght a cultivated au- dience, has been often proved, but never perhaps more satis- factorily than on the present occasion, when the Sestet was applauded with the warmth due to Its rare merits and the irreproachable manner in which it was executed.
			The vocal music, selected from the Italian, French, and English schools, represented by Mercadante, Donizetti, Pan- seron, andBalfe, was judiciously selected, the young and promising Miss Banks, and Miss Lascelles, whose contralto voice is so much and iustly admired, beins each set down for a couple of songs. The accompanist at the planoforte was Mr. W. DorreUl, himself a pianist of distinguished attainments. It is hoped that the success of this first season may lead to the permanent establishment o' the London Quintet Union.

			BIBLB-PRINTINAG PATENT.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Slr,-Tour able criticisms on the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Queen's Printers' Patent will probably invite public attention to that document, it may therefore be de- sirable that the counter-report, proposed by Mr. Walpole, and rejected only by the chairman's casting vote, should attain equal publicity.
			The report is as follows:-
			" 1. That It appears from the evidence taken before the committee that, under the existing system, the authorized version of the Bible has atbained a degree of accuracy which has never been surpassed or equalled in the publication of any other book.
			"2 That in the opinion of most of the witnesses by whom the abolitionof the Queen's Printers' Patent has been recommended, the same degree of accuracy could not be maintained if the printing of the Bible were thrown open without being sublect to a board of supervision.
			" 3. That it fut'her appears that the authorized version of the Bible is produced and publshed, under the present system, at a much caeaper rate than any other book in the Englsh language, of the same quality and size; and the evi- dence adduced before the committee does not warrant the expectation, that, in the event of the abolition of the Queen's Printers' Patent, the cost of the production and publication of Bibles would be reduced to any appreciable extent.
			"4. That it has lik-ewise been proved before the com- mittee that a keen competition exists between the Queen's Printer and the two Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and that a greab variety of dffferent editions has from time to time been published, so as to meet aU the requirements of religious societies and masters of schools, the demands of the trade, and the general wants of the whole community.
			" 5. That for the reasons and under the circumstances mentioned in the foregoing resolutions, the committee are of opinion. and they submit to the Hiouse that no sufficient erounda have been established for materiaUy dtering the present system." your fo ateria lt

			SUPPOSBD DOUBLE MURDER ZVRAR
			MWNCHESTER.
			-arly yesterday morning information reached the polie-. station at Pendlebury, near Manchester, that an old man named Scholes, and his son, who lived at 1rlams-o'-th'- Height, had been found dead in their cottage under circum- stances leading to the belief that a fearful and mysterious crime had been committed. Sergeant Lee, of Pendllebury, arrived at the house at 7 o'clock, and Mr. Birks, Mfr. Booth, and Mr. Ashburmer, surgeons of the neighbourhood, were In attendance about the same hour. It appeared thatthe elder of the deceased Williama Scholes, aged about 75, was a mian livin on a email independent income in one of three cottages
			siuted at the junction of the Swfinton and Pendleblzry roads. The other victim, William Edward Scholes, was about 41years of age. Another son, Joseph Scholes, works at the printing-office of Messrs. Bradshaw and Blacklock, at 'Manchester. The two cons slept together In one bedroom, the father oaccupied another, and a daughter, Sarah Eliz'a Scholes, had a third. The only account of the discovery that has yet been obtained was given by Joseph Scholes to Sergeant Leo. His statement is to the effect that on the previous day he left home for his work after dining corn fortably with the family about 1 o'clock in the afternoon- On his way back In the evening he was seizedI with a fi. while passing through Salford, and taken up by the policet who supposed he was drunk. At the Salford pollee-station, it became apparent that he was suffering from an infirmity, and he was liberated. Onx reaching home about 9 o'clock he found no one dowrnetairs, but heard his sister moving in hier room overhead, and making a noise which was haboituial 'with her. The surgeons are informed that she is subject te fits, and is considered deranged. Her bedroom door was locked. Joseph Scholes went to bed, and during the night he got up aboot half-a-dozen times. His sister was still making her noise. About 6 o'clock yesterday morning he went outt for some water, and met a young womnan named Phoebe Hall. At his request she went with him to his sister's roomn. They broke open the door, and saw his sister sitting on a chair, and his father and brother lying dead on the floor.
			Judging from the position In which the bodies were found, the father had fallen on the top of his sun. The father lay at right angles to the bed near Its head bin feet and part of the body were under the bed, and his Lead out- side. The son was lying parallel with the bed, his head was towards its foot, and liis feet were doubled up uxnder the body of his father. The father's face showed signs of strangulation, but there was no appearance of wounds. Bloodi was Issuing from the ears. The son's death was more unacceuntabole. There were not the same marks of strangu- lation, but there were some slight cute in the neck, which might have been made by a three-bladed pocket-knife that was found en the mantelpiece. Another pocket-knife was found in the father's hand, hut It was closed. Both the men were completely dressed.
			The police discovered that the pillow of the bedl on whiclh Joseph Scholes had slept was marked with blood. This, he says, was caused through hurting himself by faling down in the fit in Salford;i and there are traces oi a wouLnd in his head. He remnains sn the houso In custody of the police. His sister was removed in custody to thle Salford work- hLouse.

The matter has been taken up with spirit and if the difficulties which have prevented former schemes from! being successfuly carried out are overcome, this great work which was commenced by the late Mr. Branel more than 26 years ago, and upon which upwards of 40,0001. were ex- pendedup to 1843, may yet be accomplished.

A greet number of articles had been removed ready to be carried off. The thieves had got over the railines, and entered the parlour hy the window, which had been left a little way open, and had noiselessly removed a wire blind. Holland was received into custody by police- constable Cross, 1.60 E. At the hack of the premises they found French and Parker; French pretended to be drunka
			The jury found all the prisoners Guilty.
			Lambert, 68 E., said Holland had been three times con- victed of burglary, and was not only concerned In a recent burglary with violence In Foley-place, but was the pm on who hal murdered a policeman on that occasion ; so com- pletely covering his head and face with blood, that he could not Identify him at the time. When be was taken on this charge he was recognized, and was a memnber of a well- known gang of burglars, which had, however, been con- siderably decreased lately by the principal members having beer convicted ando sent to penal servitude. The other prisoners were also well known.

			POLICE. -- - - --0
			M-N IOx-HouSE.-Elizabeth Fasselow, aged 7, was again brought up by a policeman who had found her wandering about the city In a destitute condition.
			She bad been similarly charged on the previons Satur- day, when it was proved that she was taken to the City of London Union at 4 o'clock in the morn- Ing, and refused admittance by the relieving-officer. who In court said his object was to frighten her by having her locked up, so as to prevent her from coming into the city In future. The Lord Mayor, however, with much warmth, reprimanded this official for hts heartlesmess, and ordered that the child should be taken to the Union, leaving the geardiaus to seek their remedy against her father, a labourlng man resident in Lambeth.
			The relving officer was again in attendance, as was also Mr. Bowring, clerk to the City of London Union, to watch the case.
			It was stated that the child was sent home to her father by the union officials; and a respectably-dressed woman said she know the father well, and for some years had helped to take care of the child, whose mother was dead, but that the girl, young as she was, was continuaUy runnmg awav from home, and would not be kept under any sort of restraint.
			The LORD MAYosR said, al that might be, but what was to be done with a chUd of such tender years? Surely the unnlo might take cate of her and charge her father with the expense. However, it was certainly wrong in the relieving- officer to refuse to receive her into the City of London Union.
			Mr. Bowring.-Since your Lordship again refers to that, allow me to say that he acted under my instructions.
			The LORD MAYOR.-Then they were very bad instruc- tions, Sir.
			Mr. Bowring.-It was a course we were compeled to take by the frequency of her appearance among us.
			The LORD MAYoR (peremptorily).-I want to hear no more from you, Sir.
			Mr. Bowring.-I think your Lordship might act wlth courtesy to one who Is here as a public officer.
			The LORD MAYOR.-Hold your tongue, Sir, if you please; I don't wish to hear another word from you on the subject so be silent.
			Mr. Bowring.-I shaU not bo sUent; I have a right to speak.
			The LORD MAYOR.-I teU yoe again, Sir that nothing can justify the conduct of your relheving-ofcer in turning that little child away from the union, to wander about the streets at 4 o'clock in the morning.
			Mr. Bowring.-Your Lordship is wrong there. You forget thatshe was in charge of a policeman at the time; and our officer is bound to obey his instruccUons, as the city officers are bound to obey theirs.
			The LORD MAYOR.-I don't wish to hear any more from you. Take the chUd to her union.
			Mr. Bowring.-Then she must go to Lambeth,
			The LORD MAYOR.-Then, Sir, send an officer with her there.
			Mr. Bowring.-?No; let one of the city officers take her. She's in their charge now, and we've nothing to do with it.
			The LORD Ar-YoR.-Your conduct does you very little credit, Sir.
			Mr. Bowring.-That may be your Lordship's opinion, but other people may judge differently.
			The contest of tongnes then ceased, and the child was sent home to her father.

			UiULDHlALL.-ar. Ben3amin Jones, the proprletor of an Alton alehouse on Snowhill, was charged before Alderman HALE with assanlting the police in the execution of their dluty.
			dur. Humphreys, jun., appeared for the defence.
			Policeman Mobbs, 265, said he was on special dutv to pre- vent obstruction on Snow-hill, and to report any disorderly conduct that might occur in the licensed houses in the neighbourhood. He saw a number of persons standing in front of the defendant's house, with their bettin.- books in their hands; and, upon seeing him approach, they immediately entered defendant's house. Witness looked in and saw the front of the bar crowded to excess with persons who were all engaged with their books, and no refresh- ment appeared to have been served to any of them. A person who said he was 2fr. Jones told witness to go away, or he would put him away, and soon afterwards the de- fendant came out and said, " hat are you fellows (the officers) doing here? You are injuring my businees; for no one wil come in while you are at the door." The defendant also threatened to " Smash his arm with a stick, or knock his brains out if ho looked in again." Several men shortly after entered the house with betting- books in their hands, and witness again opened the door to see if any betting transactions were taking place, when the defendant struck at him with a stck, and aterwards strack him with his left hand on the breast, seized him by the coat and tried to drag him into the house, and was only prevented by witness dragging him out, and taking him into custody for the assault.
			Cross-examined.-He was only a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes watching the defendant's house It was not an hour and a half. He did not prevent customers from enter- sag the house. He saw a woman at one door, apparently watchinz the door, but he did not know she was defendant's wife. He was obhged to throttle the defendant to make him release his hold of his coat. There was no noise or confasion, as the parties were ail shut, in betting.
			Police-constable Bailey, 89 corroborated the evidence of Mobbs in all save one paicular. He said he did see two glasses of ale on the counter,as if some of the company were having refreshment.
			Mr. Humphreys, for the defence, stigmatized the com- plaint as one of the most trumpery character that nagis- irate had ever been troubled with. It WaS quite clear that whatever the instructions Mobbs, the policeman, had re- ceived he had exceeded his duty in the manner in which be had carried them out. There wasnot a more respectable body of men in existence t-han the I,ondon pohce, but unfortunately there were a class of personS v;ho felt [hat the only way to perform the duties asslgned them was by irritating and exciting every one wiith whom Ihey came in contact, and Mobbe appeared to him to belong *o thcat class. Mr. Jones wvas a verv~ resuectable man; he
			had kept this house for nearly a dozen years, and this was the first complaint that had ever been brought against him. He was ready to admit that his was a betting-honse, Inas- much as he executed commissions in betting and racmg matters, and advertised himself as a commission agent for such matters, but there was nothing illegal in that. A nzn was perfectly justified in pusuig such a line of busi- ness as long as he did not infringe the law, and certainly the defendant had not rendered himself [In any way ame- nable. In this particular Instance the policeman Hobbs was hovering about the house for about an hour and a half, polcing his head In at the door occaslonally, by which means customers were deterred from entering the house. Mrs. Jones remonstrated with Mobbs, and ultimately called dow-n her husband,whowas imnbed, toremove the officerfromthe door. The defendant accordingly expostulated with him, bat he totaUy denied having used a stick, or striking Mobbs. He merely pushed him from the door, and there were several gentlemen present who would depose to the anmoying man- ner in which the constable was dodging abont the house all the morning, as well as to the brutality with which he dragged mr. Jones out of his hose to the police-staMton on this charge, in consequeuce of which violence Mts. Jones, wtho was in a advanced stage of pregnancy, had been thrown upon a ick bed, and it was mposfable to say what might be the result.
			tlderman H.LE Said what e r Hnmphrsys said w/as mere statement against evidenca upon oath. The defendant's advertisement as a betting agent made it apprent to the officer that betting transactions wfere crried on in the house, end that was something like a good reason for watching the
			wra Lovel, a provsion merchant, of 40, snow-hill, r. eolmand, of theAcrn,inUpperThamespstreht,aad MrfColest clerk to Messrs. LoveU and Christmas, were examined, and their testimony was to the effect that po obb was nrying about the honse for a considerable time, and when the de- fendant came to the door he rushed at him and dragged him out, and, with the assistance of Bailey, marched him off to the police station. They saw Jones push Mobbs from the hoor, but no blow was strck. At the ostation Mobbu ac- ucuse them Ul of being betting men, and friends of Jones which they denied, teo of them witnessing what occurred from their own premyses opposlts, and al declariung that the defendant was a periect stranger to them. t
			asderman HALE said if the defendant had bsen charged with any offence in connexion with betting matters he should have known how to have dealt with him, but this was slmply a qAestion of assault, which he was satisfied the defendant had committed. The poUce had a perfect right indthe exercise of their duty to watch anycpremises, at there was, of course, a proper way of doing it with- out appearing too officious, or irritating and annoy- ing respectable people by over-zealousness in dis- charge of sach duty. He did not mean to say cobbs had exceeded his duty in this instance, but he thought as the defendant hadd bee locked up and put to
			unch trouble and expense in attending this conrt,that a fine ot he, woald meet the case.
			Mir Hnmphreys said it was a great clur upon a respectable man to have a conviction, however smell the ftne re"istered against him in a police court, and therefore asked for an ad- journment to enable him to bring up half-a-dozen other witnesses of tbe conduct of the officer Mebbs.
			Alderman H4LE saidI could not alter his decision, as the defendant's witnesses bad not negatived the assault
			and he had no reason to doubt the evidence of the con- stal es.
			The defendant said he never was handled so brutally in his life as he had been by hlobbs.
			The Chief Clerk said the magistrate had taken that into consideration in the amount of the fine.
			Alderman HALE said he did not consider it a very serious assault, or he should have infiicted a much heavier fine. The small amount of the penalty would show that his de- cision did net convoy a very severe censure with regard to the defendant's conduct; but if MIobbe had displayed less temper over it he should have dealt very differently with the case.
			After some further demur the fine was paid, and all parties left the court equsliy dissatisfied.

			Complainant was in attendance, but neither his Lordship nor any person in his behalf appeared.
			Mr. AaRNonD directed that proof should be given of the serving of the summons.
			Knowland, one of the warrant officers of the court, was accordingly sworn, and stated that he served the summons, requiring his Lordship's attendance at the court that day, at 26, Dluke-street, Manchester-square, on Monday evening.
			Mr. ARNOLD inquired whether that was his Lordship's place of abode.
			The officer replied that he had gone there w rith the sum- mons, becanse It was the address given by the cabman at the time he made his complaint ; but from what he had heard he did not think hisILordsbhiplved there.

			WORSihmT-STbET.-Mr. Mark Warren, a linendraper In Shoreditch, was chiarged before Mr. D'Eyz;- couRT with the following assault.
			The substance of the ease was, that some one brought an action against Mr. Warren in the Sheri's Court for a small sumi, amounting in the whole to 121. odd, and recovered a verdict for that sun. The defend- ant somehow felt aggrieved at this, there being circum- stances connected with the case, as Mr. Hudson, vho appeared for the defendant, said, of a very aggravating de. scription, and he wouldI not, or at least did not, pay the amount, uan the Under-Sheriffo therefore, signed a warrant to levy execution for 'It. This was intrusted to Daniel Gover, a sheriff's offilcer, who took with him an eldesly and porty assistant named AlJln, and on entering the shop Gover, as there were other persons present, called the defendant aside, and stated his business to him. This was not attended with the desired effect of producing a discharge of the recovered debt, and it was presently afterwards discovered that Allen was makin" himself very comfortable on a seat by the door. A witnesS named leieghton drew Mfr. Warren's attention to this, and asked him w hat Allen wanted. The defendant replled'that he wanted money, but that he (the defendan)" did not owe it, and would not pay it," and, according to Allen's evidence asked to see the warrant. Alen handed It to the defendant but others wanted to see It too. which Allen objected,toend some one having called out "Don't give it him bask, the defendant thereuponhandedthewarranttosomebedyelse,told Allen he had uo right or authority to be there, and ordered him to leave his premises. This Allen, of course, refused to do, and the defendant therefore, as Allen sal3, pushed him violently out of the shop, thereby causing the witness, a weig~hty man, to fall waith such force on the doorstep as to injure and graze his arm. Both Allen and Gover declared that there was no exposure or noise before the defendant's customers, and that everything was done as quietly and eon- siderately as posSible, though a man was &amp;again placed In posseassion, and w.as left there by the defendant even while this case was being heard.
			The Magistrate declined to hear the exasperating cir- cutmstances llr. Hundson wished to adduce, as they could have nothing to do with the officer, and the defene was therefore, confined to a general dental of any roughness or violence having been offered to Allen, none of which did either of the witnesses see or hear, and the defendant de- clared that, though he certainlv did put Allen out. it was witbout any force, and that the Injury was sustained by his accidentally faeing at the doorwvay
			Mr. D'E1fvCOURT, however, felt satisfied the officer, who seemed to be a very respectable man, had conducted himself properly on such an annoying occasion, and, as the assault uad been established in a very clear manner, he ordered the defendant to pay a penalty of 21. lOs., or to undergo a fort- night's imprisonment in default
			no defendant, however, avoided this by immediately paying the money.

			IAMflET.-Fredriek s a1nS Lfcl ary ~I:ta1n, aeia-
			ERlott, who have been in custody for Eome days on a I charge of gross cruelty towards a child two and a-half years
			of age, supposed to be the child of both, wero brought up oa remand and again placed at tho bar before the Hon. G, C(, NORTON for final examinStion.
			Police-constable George Ashley, 224 P, said that st the last examination the prisoners had represented that they wera wan and wife, and that they had been marrled at Waterloo Church, bnt he (witness) had examined the regis- ter at that church for some time before and since the perlo they had mentioned and could find no such marriage.
			Mr. NORTON observed that in consequence of the pub- licity which the case had obtained he bad received several communications from different persons, and one giving a history of the male prisoner'S conduct for a few year-s past. From the account given of him it appeared that his conduct bad been of a rnffinnly descripton, that he had broken the omn of his mother; that he had been committed! from the Southwark Court for a violent assaut upon an unfortunate woman, with whom he lived; and that the poor child he had in the present inetance so cruelly and savagely tortured was not his own child, but t.he child of the, unna3tural mother who stood by his side.
			The male prisoner faintly denied the accusaion of break- ing the arm of his mother, bat admitted having been com- mitted to the Hiouse of Correction for assaulting a young woman ; and the female prisoner admitted that they were not married - that her name was Eillett; that ese was a widow, and that the child connected with the present in- quiry was the youngest of four living at the death of her late husband. She also said that her two elder children were getting their own living, that the third was kept by her own family and that of her late husband in Norfolk - end that the fourth, Mary Ann Elliott, aged two years anhf s-half, had lived with her and Stains np to the time of their apprehension.
			The evidence taken on the former examination was here read over, after which Mr. Bulien, the medical officer at Lambeth Workhouse, was caled, and being sworn Esaid, that on the 4th inst. the child Mary Ann Elliott,who was between two and three years old, was brought to the workhouse, and on examination he found her body, arms, and legs covered with contusions and wales, which had evidently been pro- duced by blows from some blunt instrument, such as a whip or stick, and snffering from considerable nervous exdte. ment produced by the infiction of these Injuries. From that time to the present she bad been under medical treat- ment, and was, he (Mr. Bullen) was glad to say, at present conalescenr.
			The child Was here brought into court by one of tho nurses from the workhouse, and seemed vastly improved since the former examination, yet many of the marks on her arms were still perceptible.
			Mr. NORTON, at the concluslon of tho evidence, remarked that it was most fortunate the discovery of the prisoners' cruelty had taken place before they worked out the death of the poor lletle ohild, as that would appear to have been their only object. The case had excited considerable smothy, and since the last examination he (Mr. Norton} had. receIved offers from more than one or twvo benevolent persDns to have the poor child taken proper cre of. Accord- ing to the mother's statement, the only alternative for the child was a parlsh workhouse and he vwas thereforo anxious to hear from her if she would consent to the child's being properly cared and provided for.
			The female prisoner peremptorily refused to introst her child to any one but her owen friends in N5orfolk.
			Mr. TonrTox animadverted in severe terms on the brn- tality of the prisoners, observing that he did not know which wasthe worse, and sentenced each to six months' hard labourat Wfandsweorth House of Correction.

			Tow-, IMPRovE'%m-Ts AT Lvnnrpoot.-At am adjourned meeting of the Liverpool Town Council yes. terday, the improvement commlttee snbmitted a recom- mendation to carry out an extensive Esheme oi towvn Improvements at an estimated cost of 300,0001. Theplan compriLed the wideningof manyoldstreetsand the construction of now ones, and embraced the improve- ment of the approaches to the landing stages. The com- mittee recommended that applicationbe madeto Parliament for power to borrow 300,0001. the interest upon whioh wouldl it was estimated, be met by a borough-rate of 3d. in tho pound. One of the greatest advantages offered by tho scheme was the formation of a new line of streets, openinz at the place at which it Is proposed to erect the new station in connexion with the terminus of the contemplated line of railway to Garston and St. E[elen's, which, in conjunction with the Great Northern Railway, is to form a now routo to London. It was stated that if the scheme was po3tponcd for 10 years the cost would be 10 times the amount. Tho confirmation of the committee's proceedings having been moved, an amendment was proposed to the effect thot tho consideration of the subject be adjourneduntil the report oi
			the special committee appointed to consider the plans for the proposed public offices, which, exclusive of land, are t(&gt; cost I00,0001., should have been submitted and approved by the council. After considerable discossion, the amendment was carried by a majority of 37 to four.

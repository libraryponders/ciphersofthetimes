John Hodgson, to which, as a prlicipal cause they attribute the great Increase maae in all the branche3 of the Charitys reyenne, whether donations, annual subsriptlons. or legaces. This lst has now been fairly adopted by aU classes of per- eons tbroughout the kinndom, so that no doubt ran exIst of its WcnO liar fitness for affording an opportunity for thousands of porsous to give, wbo not baving much to 'gite, still desire to gIve acmording to the little they have, that so through their bounty. admi- nistered accordmg to their limited power, in connexdon with that of those rihebr than themselves, a cOmmon national fund may be created for uccouriog thee whose sad afinItians, while they eannot bot awaten the sympathy of all, never appeal In vain to thereligiouslyminded.

			FRANCE.
			(� OUB ROWN CORR1BEsPONDpE.)
			ta pOfflu ,--the fofow}ng appemzed In our second
			k'AHM, SUSDAY, APRIL 1, 6 P.3L
			The Government deems it right to infogrn the public, through the Moniteur, that the Organic Law of the Concordat prescribes that-" No bull, brIef, rescript, decree, mandate, provision, aigna- tre serving for provision, or other document from the Court of Rome, even relating to individuals, can be received, published, printed, or otherwise carried into emecution, without the permison of the Government."
			This warning has reterence, of course, to the Papal excommunication just pronounced againat the " abettors," &amp;c., of the annexatlon of the Romagna to Piedmont. The Eacmmu7nicatior. Majeure de- prives the excommunicated of all participation in the pablic prayers of the Church offered up for the fdthfuL The excommunicated cannot administer or receivo the Sacrament, nor can they be present at Dhvine Service. If an excommunicated peraon enters a church the service must at once cease, or when he presents himself the priest must quit the altar. The excommunicated is deprived of Christian bural; a cemetery in which he Is interred becomes pollute. The excommunicated cannot name or be named to benefice or ecclesiastical dignities; lhe cannot exercise spiritual jurisdiction; and, in a word, he Is deprived of all communication with the faithful, either in sacred orimere worldly matters.
			Such being the moat strking consequences of excommunication, we may easily believe that, even without the notice which the fmoniteur has given, the Court chaplains would not read in presence of His Majesty, and in full chapel, the bull which in- flicta these penalties on the "c actors, promoters, ad- visers, cooadjutors, &amp;-a., of the invasion" of the Romagna. I should like to know the opinion of the Cardinal Archbishop of Paris, who is alBo Chief Almoner of the Imperial Palace, as to the extent of the bull, and the persons who are or are not com- prized in it.
			The Jourma de Genlire of Saturday contains the following, on the attempt made by a band of 40 or 50 dizorderly persona to get up disturbances in neutralized Savoy:-
			" We wrote yesterday, at 3 p.m,-' Tl:s morning, at 4 O'clock, a small band of armed men seized on a steamer stationed at the Grand Qual, and, after having by violence forced the crew to depart, proceeded towards Thonon (Chs.
			lis6). It appears the object was to effect a landing at this polnt in order to ralse the population in the pretended in- tere3t of the Swiss cause. We do not Imow if this plan has been realized, but it Is generaUy believed that the at- tempt, which is as stupid as It Is criminal, had not the slightest succes. 'United Ina common feelng of indigna- tion, all pa-ties are agreed in stigimatizing by a universal and profound reprobation this mad attempt, which is as contrary to the Interests of Switzerland as to those of jsvoy. "
			-The Tournsal de Genhte further remarks as foUlows on the foregoing _
			" The attempt of which we have just spoken has not had, In-fact, even a commencement of success. At half-past 4 She Chassenra of the 20th, accompanied by three commis- saries of pollce, embarked in the Guilaunme Tell, And over- took In the Genevese waters, between Hermance and Belle rive, the steamer Italle, on board of which was ML John Frroler, with about 30 of his followers. They were brought back by the Gollaume Tell, and conducted to the Towin- house by the troops, amid an immense crowd, which unani- monsly showed the indignation which animated them against the authors of an attempt of which the first effect, If It had had the slightest resnlt,lwonld have been to throw Geneva and the whole Confederation into the most disastrous compllcations.
			"Otherwise Dl the details which we recdve concu in stating that no armed descent and no violation of territory have been the consequence of this freak. Thus this odious attempt, the consequences of which might have been fatal, and the issue of which borders on the ludicrous, will only have for a result the manifestation at Geneva, as on all points of Switzerland, of a feeling of respect for rights, and of the necessity to remain unalterably faithful to the Fede- ral authority and to the principles of loyalty which have alwaya constituted the character as well as the strergth of Swiss policy."
			-the Council of State of Geneva has addressed a proclamation to their fellow-citizens reprobating the attempt, and Btating that an inquiry is going on with a view to bring the guilty parties to justice.
			Publc opinion in the financialand commercial world is greatly agitated by alternate hope and fear, in consequence of the uncertainty which prevails with respect to the future position of the county. The Government has made extraordinary efforts to re3tore confidence, but without success. Every com- mercial man one meets admits the importance of Lord John Russell's last speech on the annexation of Savoy and Nice to France. All men engaged in trade were accustomed to regard the English alliance as the best guarantee for the peace of Europe, and, mow that they are told by the highest authority that Great Britain will seek an alliance elsewhere, they are filled with dismay. They still, however, have faith In the Emperor's sagacity, and they ex- pect that he vwil yet make such conces- sions as may restore, if not the entente cor- diale, at least friendly relations. The tmanufac- turers of Alsace are still petitioning the Emperor to make certain modifications In the Customs' tariff more favourable to their interests. The calico- printers in that province suggest that foreign calicoes be admitted duty free fnto France on con- dition that they be re-exported within six months. They expect by such an arrangement to undersell the English manufacturers in their own markets; the French millowners, however, are opposed to the suggestion. The accounts irom the agricultural districts, particularly in the central departments of France, are not favourable. It is still too early in the season to give an opinion as to the quality of the nest harvest, but there is one fact not to be overlooked, which Is, that the constant rain during the last month has been unfavourable to the Eowing of the spring wheat Almost aU the land prepared for that crop must now be sown with oats or barley. The Paris flour-market was more firm iat week than the week preceding. The millers demanded an advance of If. the sack for their flour, but the bakers showed the most perfect indifference, and sales were difficult. Flour of the four marks experienced a slight rise, but it was not maintained, 2nd prices receded to 55f. 50c. the sack of 157 kilo- grammes for April, 66f. 50c. for Mhay, 67f. 50c. for June, and 5Sf. for July. The factors declared yes- terday 1,184 sacks of flour, of which 111. were of first quality, sold for delivery within 30 days at prices varying from 53f. to 5Sf. the sack. The farmers who attended the Paris corn:tmarket last week in- zsated on au advance of If. in the sack of wheat of 120 kilogrammes; but, finding, no buyers on those terms, they submitted to sell at the prices of the preceding week-, 30f. to 34f. the sack of 120 kilo- granmmes, according to quality. The Minister of Var advertised for 12,000 quintals of wheat, but received offers for oniy 200 quintals at his price, 26f. 50c. the quintaL Oats are stiU scarce in the Paris market. Sellers demanded an increase of 50c. in the sack of 150 kilogrammes, but defini- tively prices remained unvaried. Rye is quoted at 20f. 50c. the 116 kilogrammes. Barley is very firm at from l9f. to 21f. 60c., accordina, to quality. The most obstinate French farmers are now beain- ning to be convinced of the absurdity of the sliding scale by which the export of corn from France Is regulated. For example, the growers of wheat in the departments of the Ille-et-Vilaine, the Cotes-du-Nord, Finlsterre, anad DMorbihan, com- plain that their produce is selling at a price which leaves them no profit, and never- theless the sliding Ecale tells them they cannot export corn except on the payment of 4f. the hectolitro ; to which they reply that wheat in their market3 Is not dearer than in departments which are permitted to export on the payment of 25c. the Kectolitre. The ofGicial quotation of tho price of wheat is, moreover, If. less than in the depart- ments of the Upper and tower Rhine, where the owners of wheat are permitted to export it on the payment of 2f. the hectolitre. The farmers in the two latter departments likewise complain that wheat was sold at the last markets of Strasburg and MIulhouse at 20f. 80c. the hectolitre. They might have exported it with advantage to the Palatinate and to Switzerland, which are in want of wheat, if tho export duty had been only 25c. tho hectolitre, but it is raised to 2f., and exportation becomes imn- pcssible. The Psiatinate and-Switzerland may seek for wheat elsewhere.
			noe telegraph ha3 spplied ua with the arice of

			There ;wa a good demand for beef at the market of Poisy on Thursday. The quality of the oxen offered for sale was good, and they were rapidly sold at a rise. Prices varied from if. 10c. the hilo- gramme to lf. 44c. The cows were of bad quality, and yet they brought from If. 5c. to lf. 26c. the kilogra-me. The sheep were less good than usal, and prices varied from If 50e. to 1� 64c. the kilo- gramme. The veal calves were of exceUent quality, and eold hlgh, at from lf. 50c. to If 64c. the kilo- gramme.
			There was very little demand for wines last week, either at Bercy or the entrep6t. The cause is attri- buted to the crisis, which paralyzes trade in general, andis moremanifeet at theendof themonth of March, when heavy payments are to be made and cash is scarce. Buyers likewise find prices high in compa- rison with the quality of the merchandise for sale. The consumption of Paris gives rise to some transac- tions, but that is not sufficient for the brokers. The cold weather likewise has checked the demand.
			The Journal du Havre says:-
			"Sinco the conclusion of the Treaty of Commerce with England agent, of London fi,nns bave been visiting our vine- yards to purbase wines and brandies. In Provence and inLguedoolalne purchases already esceedthe sum of 20.000,u00f., and at Cognac 15,000 hectolitrea of brandies have been bought."
			It is announced that the railway from Boulogne to Calais is shortly to be commenced, and is to be concluded as qnickly as possible. It is to unite with the Paris and Calala Railway at Pont de Briques, in the Pas de Calais.
			The works of the railway from Toulon to Nice have commenced in the district of St. RaphaeL The number of navvies is increased every day, and several houses have been rented at St. Raphael and the neighbourhood to lodge the contractors and clerks attached to the railway company. The appear- ance of St. Raphael has become quite changed. Several provisoion storeshave been opened therefor the supply of the operatives, and the boats which wverelying idle at the quay have been hired to con- vey the materals required for the railway.
			Among the foreign railways the receipts of the lombard alone show a faliling7 nfl
			l. Pcegot, a professor of cbymistry in Paris, haa received a specimen of mineral silver, which reachedGeneralMorin,theI)irector of the Conserva- toire des Arts et Aletiers, from California only three days since. It is said to have been taien from a mine which occupies a surface of 25 square miles, and is of great depth. The mineral is described as remarkably pure and rich, containing not less than 26 per cent. of silver, together with a fair propor- tion of gold, copper, and antimony. Should the mine be as rich as it Is decribed, it will, In the opi- nion of the learned chymist, restore the equilibrium between the relative value of gold and silver, which was beg,inning to be disturbed.
			The Brest fleet, under the command of Admiral Paris, sailed on Thursday last from that port for the M4editerranean. It is composed of the screw ship of the line Redoutable, bearing the Admiral's flag, the Imperial, and the Arcole.
			P.S. It is reported that a note has been addressed by the French to the Belgian Government. As it is always agreeable to communicate favourable in- telligence, I do not hesitate to mention what I have heard about the matter, though I am not in a con- dition to vouch for its correctness. In this note it is said that assurances of a satisfactory kind are given to King Leopold's Government,-viz., that the annexation of Savoy was an incident of an exceptional nature, which cannot occur again with respect to any other country; that the united kingdom of theLowCountries was consti- tuted, on the fall of the first Empire, to serve as a check on France, but that their separation in 1880, by a revolution, removed what was objectionable in its character; that Belgium is now an independent kingdom, of which the neutrality is guaranteed by the Europern Powers, and that consequently there is no ground whatever for apprehending anything on the part of France agai-nst that country.
			A note of a similar kind is said to have gone to Berlin.
			I hope, though I cannot positively affirm, that this statement is correct. I also hope that, if it is correct, the assurances are more seriously aud sin- cerely meant than those which we have for some time back been accustomed to. At any rate, I give them as they have reached me.

			The little abortive excitement which was got up yesterday has completely subsided. The second detachment of French troops which had been ex- pected did not arrive, and-I don't know whether from economy or a feeling of shame-the great ma- jority of the fags have disappeared. With the ex- ception of those at the railway station, the public buildings, and two large ones on the tower of the chateau, not 50 fiags remain in the whole town, to which the windows of the French Consulate contri- bute a considerable share. The French soldiers have quite lost their attraction; they pass unheeded and uncared for, as you or I would; nay, more so, for an Inverness wrapper announcing the traveller in these regions is an object of no smal interest. The sharp-eyed Savoyards spy guineas in modest Scotch woollen trousers, whereas they never suspect any- thing but SerS in red onea. Oh t if the good felvetic Confederation had intrusted me with getting up an anti-French movement in Savoy, it would not have taken long, nor would it have ruined their finances I Some hundred thousand printed schedules, with "' Uniom a la France,--point d?Aspglais r' on them, or, if they would have ik-ed to turn the feeling altogether in their favour, it would have cost very little more to add, "U Uiion a la &amp;isise et deux fois utautt dc'Anglais." Such schedules would have worked wonders; I am not sure whether they would not have produced a revolution, and that just iu the most important part of Savoy-the three neutralized districts. The tocsin would have sounded in all the valleys round Mont Blanc, and the people would have clamoured for ML%r. Albert Smith, their patron, who has done already so much for Chamouni, to lead them against the Zouaves.
			But if the excitement about the presence of the French troops has subsided, the anxiety about the uncertainty of their fate still oppresses the Sa- voyards. It is now nearly a year since the agita- tion began, and that they saw before them the possibility of a change of rule. One moment it seemed quite near, then it vanished almost com- pletely, then the probability revived aaain, and died agatn away. It was one contiusaT fluctuation, which has thrown everything into confusion. It has checked whatever little enterprise emisted, and has hung like a clog on aU the most common trans- actions. No one would embark in a new enter- prise which might be destroyed by the impending change. Every one waited to see what would be the result. Those who were honest suffered, and tried to pass as best they could through these trials; others thought it a good opportunity to fish in the troubled waters. Never have there been so many banL-ruptcies k-now in this part of the world, espe- ciaUy at Chambery, and if the thing is not soon settled the number of them wrill be quite formidable. In a very small commercial community the same features show themselves as in very large ones; all transactions are more or less in connexion, and in- fluence each other, so that if once the crumbling begins a general rnin is almost inevitable.
			Even now that the annexation may be said to be effected, things are scarcely better. With the im- pending alteration of the Customs line, it would be foUy to buy or sell when in a mouth or two the cir- cummtances will be quite changed. A commission to tender advice on the new Customs line has been called together at this place, showing that there is an satention on the part of France to consult the wishes of the population, at any rate in this matter.
			As for any other vote, the probability of it has altogether vanished; one hears absolutely nothing of it. Even the manifestation of the Savovard depu- ties is looked upon as a mere formality, now that the annexation may be considered as complete. .Tho reltance to Vote wa ph thaom jty
			of the deputies scarcely unite the required propor- tion of two-thirds of the electors inscribed I EUpi
			pose it will dep,endon the issue of the baLoting to- day in the three districts if they are anti-French, ans people hoped when I wras there. Tha insufficiency of the votes finmost electoral diutricts may be used as a pretext to dispense wiith the presence of the Savoyard deputies inParliarant,under theplea that Savoy herself declined this honour by not Voting. If, on the contrary, the election in the three ds
			tricts should be favourable, then the formaity will be complied lwith and be considered as a vote.
			In the meantime, to prepare for all emergencies, a counter-addres to that of the inhabitants of North Savoy has been got up, and is sent all over the country for Eignatures. It is a declaration of ad- hesion to the treaty of the 2d of March. A com- mittee resident here directs the signatures to this address. The success of it can scarcely be doubtful, for how can one expect the quiet loyal Savoyard to disapprove a treaty which -his King has concluded with the mighty Emperor of the French ? It is probably to give to this mani- festation the appearance of having been made with- out coercion that the passage of the French troops seems to have been stopped, and even those who hailed the arrival of those actually here speak now of them as only on their march, It was likewize with this view that the National Guard has been put into requisition, and is now used for all posts, the French soldiers remaining like guests in the large barracks.
			The Government detaches by degrees, and almost unobserved, aU the ties which connect it with the population of Savoy. To-dav a decree of the Minister of W?ar gives the definitive quietus to the categories of 1830, 1831, and 1832, which had been called out here, as in the other provinces of the Sar- dinian States. The Savoyard troops already under arms will be left the option to remain orto retarn to their homes. There is only one body composed ex- clusively of Savoyards, the brigade which goes under that name in the Piedcmontese army; for the rest,the conscripts of this country are divided among the dif- ferent arms of the service. There were, for instance, in the two companies of Bersaglieri who have been here until lately nearly 100 of them, and so there Is a greater or smaller proportion everywhere else.
			All the Piedmontese troops are gone, with the exception of the Carabineers, who have not re- ceived their orders as yet.
			Tne Syndic of OChambery, the Colonel and one of the Majors of the National Guard, have given in their resignation; they aU belong to the Piedmon- tese party.
			I forgot to tell you of a circumstance which oc- curred here in the elections, and which characterizes the whole thing. In several of the coUeges His MIajesty the Emperor of the French was elected, and in others France. Really, it is absurd to speak of freedom of voting in this country under any cir- cumstances. With a due use of influence you might make them vote for the sun or the moon.
			This morning two more companies of the 80th arrived by the railway, making in all six. The talk is that as soon as the first battalion is com- plete it will proceed to France. Altogether there seems a change of plan in this respect. There was no ceremony to receive the new arrivals to-day- scarcely any people at the station. As for flags, they have almost disappeared. With the exception of the public buildings, there are not ten houses wihich exhibit the symbols of annexation. Even the French Consular authorities, who displayed them the first day, have drawn them in. There is evidently a mot doardre to make the ocupation appear altogether as a passage of the troops homewards, and nothing more. The whole thing seems to have relapsed into the phase of negotiation, and while those last aUl measures will be stopped, no doubt. This will cause a lull for some time to come, during which the signatures of adhesion wil be pressed in the communes. The meeting of the Piedmontese Par- liaraent wiUl probably be the new starting point.

			THE ANNEXATION OF TUSCANY.
			(FROM OUR OWN CORON-DENn.)
			FLORENCE, M?dncw 28.
			The Piedmontese are at our gates; they are forming on the meadows of the Cascine, waiting for their companions as they come up, train after train, from Leghorn. The town has the usual flourish of gay, gaudy flags, ready for their recep- tion * but the sky has also its dark display of heavy clouds, threatening to give the newcomers a flood by way of a welcome. Some of the Bersaglieri and Grenadiers are already bustling about the streets; their bright, secure look, their thick-set sinewy frames, and, above all things, their seven-league- boot step, are objects of adniration to these softer and easier Tuscans. Yet the Tuscans themselves are rapidly mending their pace; the troops, and even the National Guards, are eagerly substituting the French double-quick step for their slow and sure, stiffand straight, measured order of march, to which an Austrian field officer had been training the Grand- Ducal army for the last ten years. Even the German school of Baron D'Arco Ferrari, however, was a great improvement upon the demeanour and movements of the native soldiery, such as people familiar with Tuscany at a period previous to 1848 must remember under the slang appelation of Bianchini (from their white coats), a soldiery which was one degree below those famous "soldati dd Papa, di cui ci voglion dieci a carare una rapae' (Pope's soldiers, who, by toiling hand and foot, take ten to pull a turnip by the root). The whole of Italy, for that matter, is taking up a martial attitude; even the Neapolitan cavalry are no longer those grotesque puppets on rocking-horses of which English mana- gers give us the caricature in their Christmas panto- mimes. But into these provinces of emancipated Italy the influence of France and Piedmont has breatbed a new Spirit, and not only does even mild Tuscany yield good soldiers and in sufficient num- oers, but the recruits, who nnder the Grand-Ducal regi1ne came under the standards With the look of men going to be hanged, are now seen marching forth from towns and villages with a proud look and a free step, shouting and singing, with tricolour ribands streaming from their caps, with the national flag at their head, and the rural band playing the lively strain, " Soldati, aWR armi, aU' armi P and
			"iva. la quei ra 1 So greatly will political dircum- stances, and a proper appeal to the feelin gs even of the ignorant masses, change the nature of a peoule !
			Well maay the Italians be aU up and doing, for their national work !s rather sketched than even half done. Austria is only biding her time, and the new kingdom, with open frontiers both on the east and west, and on the south, must rely on every man buckling on his armour and making a bulwark of his breast to his country; all this at a moment when at least 10,000 of the best combatants of Cus- tosa, the Tracktir, and San Martino-10,000 Savoy- ards and Nizzards-are lost to Piedmont for ever.
			INe have the Royal decree for the separate ad- ministration of this province, and the Tuscan " auto- nomy" Is safe, at least for the present. To-morrow we expect the arrival of our Viceroy, or Lieutenant, the Prince of Carignano. We have already our Governor-General, Baron Ricasoli, among us. With the exception of the Secretary for War, as the army and navy will be at once made one for the whole kingdom, aU our Blinisters remain, though under the more modest appellation of "lDirectors" of their respective departments. Some doubts still hannt mny mind as to the management of the finances, as the Customa are already iuited, and the best part of the indirect revenue wil flow into the treasury of the Central Government at Turin. The Tuscan Cabinet, besides, will not be empowered to open new credits without depending on the MIinister of the Finances in the capital and the National Parliament. 'While all these doubts are being solved, and indeed while the ann shines, Ricasoli and his colleagues are busy hay-making. A Ecore of decrees in the Monitore of yesterday, all bearing dates previous to the cere- mony of annexation, tend to the increase of that dowry, or troussean, with which these patriotic statesmen were determined that Tuscany should be decorously fitted for her bridal with Piedmont. Some of these decrees add to the number of the Professors of the University of Siena; others en- large the Istituto Superlore, or Arch-Univef6ity of Florence; others, again, provide for the foundation, or reorganization, of a Mlusical Institute or Con- servatory; for a school of declamation, for prizes to be awarded for the best dramatical composition, &amp;c. Literary, scientific, academical, artistlcal, musical, histrionic, and even choregraphic edu- cation is to be supplied in Toscany on a scale of magnificence unparalleled in the greatest Monzrchles. Florence, especially, is to become a great doctor-painter-sculptor-singer-flddler-daunr- mSan tory. By all these liberal meawu,m not oply.do proW. rDlem confer % vast and perma-
			nent benefit upon their own part of Italy, but as they think, they open firt-rate Istitutions by which the youth of the whole Peninsula, and espe- cially of the united kdngdom, may freely profit. No doubt, at the sme time, they feather their friends' nest. The establishment of so many profesorhi'pe and of sD many offices pertaining to all their institutions, .enables them to exercise an ex- tensive patronage, by which they win over sup- porters to the good cause no less than to their own party. Popularity always attends a ruler who has plenty of good things in his gift, and popularity is a weapon which a patriot can alwaya turn to the advantage of patriotism. Only some day the ques- tion may rise as to how the Tuscan finances will bear the barden so freely laid upon them, or to what extent Tuscany may prove to the sister provinces that it is right the burden should weigh on them all, as it has been laid with a view to rear establishments intended for the promotion of the common good. The Tuscan rulers henceforth will be answerable to the national Par- liament, and will, I have no doubt, be able to give tho best account of their administration. There are men, however, who regret that Ricasoli should so far have immolated hielf as to refuse the port- folio of Agriculture and Commerce and the Presi- dency of either the Senate or the Chamber of Depu- ties which had been offered to him at Turin, and offered to carry on his shoulders the irksome burden of tho Tuscan Premiership, prolong- ing that provisional and exceptional state of things the end of which had been so confidently announced, and securing for his own Tuscay an " autonomy" which may ba looked upon by the other provinces as an invidious privilege, and which may, perhaps, be as little conducive to the real wel- fare of this part as to the real union, strength, and compactness of the whole of the Idngdom.
			The Piedmontese troops will not be ready for their triumphal entry till, at the soonest, 5 or 6 in the evenig-that is, some time after the closing of the mail. With all the rest of the Florentine population, I have just driven out to the COscine to see these gallant strangers, who are no longer foreigners, encamped along the alleys and under tho magnificent avenues of that shadiest of all Italian promenades. The soldiers, the Bersaglieri especialy, look their very best and are in capital condition. Stout, white and ro3y, radiant with health and youth and good-humour, they present a striking contrast to the appearance they had about eight months ago,when thoycame hack all sunburnt and dried up, travhe-soiled and dusty,from their short but trying and exhausting Lombard campaign. They are not a romantic or even aTdemonstrative set; they look pleased, but not enraptured at tho
			idea of exchanging the baulks of the Po for those of the Arno; they gaze at the streets, and hills, and edifices of this fa-famed town, Iterested without being excited; .they show friendliness and affability, but no very expansive enthusiastic cordiality to- wrds their Tuscan brethren. There is a sober and demulre, half-shy look about them, as free aS possible from mo'rgue or arrogance, but which seems to me q,uite becoming soldierly gravity. Their staid and silent demeanour exhibits also a pleasing contrast to the somewhat iapageur gaiety of the French, whom I also visited daily under their tents, as they lay or sat, or cooked, or frisked and danced about in these same damp meadows of theoCascine. The French evidently laid themselves out for admira- tion the Piedmontese gaze about, wondering at thethings they see, but evidently thinldng very little aboat themuselves, and about the figure they cut in the eyes of the Florentines.
			IAR-CH 29.
			Yesterday was a day of popular rejoicing ; to-day is a national holyday. Despotism had its church festivala; freedom has its street jubilees. The priests treated us to processions; the soldiers delight us with parades. Our flags hang out ens pemanence. At tha same balcony where you saw them late in the evening again you behold them early in the morn- ing. Not a few of them look a little the worse for wear; damaged to some extent by tho rakishl night they have been spending out of windows; some- what damp with the heavy morning dew, a thought limp and draggled may be, tiUl the fresh sun and breeze revive them, when they flap up and wave again triumphantly, unfolding their bright colours, like flowers heavingup their heads and basking in the tepid beams of the new-dawning day.
			Contrary to our bxpectalicn, the weather held up yesterday, and the dark clouds thinned away as the day waned. Between 5 and 6 the division of General Durando, which had been gathering outside the gate at the Cascine, began its march into the town. So dense a crowd of people Borgo Ognisanti never, perhaps, witnessed before. No opening had been made for the troops, and they had almost to fight their way, gently and gingerly pushing through the dense throng, which just allowed room for them to pas3, one half-company, after another, immediately closing on their wake, and invading the ground before and behind and on all sides, so that the armed, well-serried rank6 were almost lost in the shapeless and colourless mass which swarmed all around and ingulphed them. It was partly, perhaps, owing to this circumstance that the reception of these first Piedmontese troops ever known to have come to Florence to take lessons in the Tuscan dialect at its purest sources unde- filed partook more of the nature of curiosity and friendly interest than of noisy, transeendant en- thusiasm. The great human swarm moved inch by inch; the soldiers, wearied with a whole day'B waiting on the public promenade, looked fagged and dispirited, and the not very strenuous attempts at cheering and applause that were made by the people at somewhat rare intervals were answered from the ranks in a rather listless and constrained manner. Had the smart Bersaglieri taken the town by storm, as the French did, dashing along the streets at their own prodigious quick pace, the very sight would have taken every heart at once ; as it was, the march had something almost liko a funereal solemnity. The troops were welcome, but people felt a great deal more than they cared to express.
			First came General Durando Giovanni, the one who commanded at Vicenza in 1848 and distin- guished himself in the Crimea. By his side rode Colonel Fenzi, the Commander of the National Guard; then, on foot, the whole Staff, both ofi the citizen militia and of the Tuscan troops still quar- tered in the town-a flashing, clattering multitude; then the Bersaglieri followed, a battalion of them; after them the Grenadier Brigade Lom- bardia, three regiments of fine, tall, robust young men, most of them recruited out of the dispersed Lombard regiments late in the Austrian service; a company of engineers closed the march. The regiment Piemonte Reale, now Cuirassiers, the finest corps of Piedmontese Ca'valry, did not appear, as they have to march all the way from Genoa by easy stages along the BRiviera, and will not be haer for some days. The affair was, In fact, in the opinion of most men, a failure. possibly because tho prudent Florentines deemed it wise to husband their breath to cheer the hero of to-day, the Prince of Carignano, whose arrival is announced to take place at noon.
			Already, since yesterday, the good-natured Ring's heutenant was hung up in effigy at the shop win- dows in almost every coiner of the streets ; his likeness I mean, or what was offered for sale as such. A very stout benevolent face, very bald head, fishy eyes (the libel, if such it be, is the artist's, not mine), and an aristocratic Roman nose (no bad con- trast to the eelestial central feature of his Royal cousin, the King),-Buch we were informed is the outward seeming of the man who is sent to rule over us; yet a few minutes, ana we shall have it in our power to compare the facsimzle with the original.
			Ve have a finer morning than yesterday; the sun's heat, no less than its glare, has been hitherto somewhat intolerable, but as noon draws near be- nignant vapours moderate the fervour of its rays. Had we ordered a day for the occasion we could not have a better one. Look up and down this long via di Borgo Ogiissanti,-how many think you of the honest Florentineoburghers are left to take care of empty houses l-how many to do their work at shops and counting-houses I Why, the very officials at the Post-office have sued for a three hours' re- spite from their incessant duties. The Ita3ian never compromises with amusement; house- keepers] leave their apartments in the keeping of lock and key, and cooks allow their stufato, or stew, to simmer gently on the half-spent charcoal embers. Dinnerwillkeep. Is not a kitchen- wench a woman and a sister I-aye, and a freed woman, too, since her enslavers, the Grand Duke and his Austrians, have made bankrluptcy? She, too, has a right, as she has a will, to trn her bhek upon pots and pans, put on her Snuday-best, sally forth into the streets, push through the mob, and have her own peep at ths show.

			AUSTRIA.
			FTM oDVI ow- CORRESINDENT.)
			V IENNA, MARCH 30.
			In my letter of the 28th inst. mention was made of a grand dinner given by the Papal Nuncio at this Count to Monsignore de Merode, and itig necessary to return to the subject, as it has transpired that one of tho persons who partook of Monsignore de Lucca's hospitality on the occauion in question was X de Lamoriciae, the rell known French GeneraL When the Privy Chamberlain of his Holines3 pased through the city on his way from Rome it was re- ported that he was going to France to deliver a very flattering message from the Pope to the Bishop of OrleanBs; but It now appears that he went to Brus- aels to see 3I de Liamoricijre. During the first interview between AL do Merode and the French General it was settled that the latter shotld leave at once for Rome, and take the command of the Papal troops directly after his arrival. M. de Lamorici-re observed the strictest incegnzto whie here, but I now recollect to have met him in the Herren-Gasse towards the end of the last week. The name under which the French General travelled was " Leon .Juchault," and with himn was a certain F'rangois Pierre Catoir, who ls supposed to be an officer of engineers. On his arrival at Trieste, on the 26th inst., Mi. de MIerode, who was accompanied by Messrs. Leon Juchault and Ft. P. Oatoir, went on board a Lloyd jteamer, which was in waitin, and left at once for Ancons. Reliable information haa been received that very many Papal soldiers have recently deserted to the Sardinians, but the latter prudently refuso to accept the proffered services of the Swiss and German mercenaries. The Romans are, however, received with open arms. Telegraphic information has been re- ceived from Naples that the Neapolitan Govern- ment does not intend to send any troops across the frontiers into the domains of the Church, and the news is perfectly correct. Some time ago the Neapolitan Government enter- tained an idea of making a descent from the Abruzzi into Umbria and the Marches, but this Court counselled King Francis II. to keep his troops at home, and he was wise enough to accept the ad- vice. A person who is perfectly well informed of what is passing in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies thinks it would be a very hazardous experiment to send a Neapolitan army into the Papal States, "as the nation would hardly fail to rise in the rear of the troops." Some five years ago Prince Petralla sO strongly and incessantly nrged the Austrian Cabinet to persuade the Neapolitan Govern- muent to change its system of administra- tion that Count Buol considered the repre- sentatlve of King Ferdlnand I a a revolu- tionist, but the recent events in Italy have proved that the Neapolitan diplomatist had more fore- sight than the Austrian statesman, As Prince Petrulla openly condemns the conduct of AL Ca- raffa and his myrmidons, he is unpopular here, bat he is a man of great independence of character, and cares but little vhether the Imperial Govenm- ment is pleased or displeased with him.
			In the highest circles great fears are entertained that an attack will be made on Venetia in the course of the summer, but Sardinia has BO much business of im- portance on her hands that she must, for a time at least, wish for peace. The political wvorld is greatly edified by the docility and self-denial exhibited by the Lombards, Parmese, Mlodenese, Tuscaus, and Romagnoles, but it is doubtful whether they would be on such friendly terms together if their bugbear, Austria, were not in possession of the for- midable quarilateral What will become of the Sardinian troops in the Legations and Miodena if the Austrians, Neapolitans, and Romanes should ever make a simultaneous attack on them? The Oesterreichische Zeitung, the organ of the Austrian Minister of Finances, denies that any furlough men have been called in, but it is in error. The three corps d'arnme which are in Venetia are complete, and there is reason to beleve that all the furlough men belonging to the Jiager battalions have recently been called in. Count Degenfeld, the commander- in-chief of the army inVenetia, is nowreviewing the 7th corps,which is quartered inthe neighbourhood of Treviso andVenice, but in a few dayshe will go to the southern part of Venetia, where a corps is being formed for the defence of the line of the Po. A few nights ago a patrol of Austrian Jiigers lost its way, and got on to Sardinian soil, where it was ill-received by the pickets. The latter fired at the intruders, who returned the complment, but no blood was shed, as the night was so dark that the contendingparties could not see each other. The emigratien from Venetia continues, but not on such a grand scale as formerly.
			The authiorities have not been able to open the theatres at Venice, because no Italian singers or actors will render any service to the Austrian Go- vernment. The Venice correspondent of the Triies
			Zit,ung spealks of the improvement in the state of public feeling, but no one is deceived by such state- ments. The fact is that the aversion of the Vene- tians to their Austrian masters is as great as ever, and the latter are perfectly well aware that such is the case. Some few of the Vienna volunteers have already returned from Ancona because the promises made to them were not kept. The Papal agents, however, atirm that the men were " sent" back because they were mutinous. On the 21st inst. a deputation of peasants from the Vins0hgaa waited on the Archduke Stadtholder of the Tyrol, and peti- tioned that the road up to the Wormser-Joch (Stelvio) might not be destroyed, as a great number of poor people earned their daily bread by keeping it m proper repair.
			In political circles a projected alliance between France, Russia, and Austria is discussed, but the Emperor Francis Joseph neither can nor will become the ally of the Emperor Napoleon, who is universally declared to be a man " ohiw Treue und Glatl3en" (devoid of loyalty and good faith). Very great attention is paid to Prince AIetternich, but he is not likely to allow him se]E to be duped by his Paris friends, as he has aleady obtained great insightinto their way of doing business.
			Yest.erday Prussia renewed her protest against the dlecision of the German Diet in the question of the Constitution of the Electorate of Hesse, and by so doing she has acquired the respect of the German people, who are sick and tired of the arbitrary con- duct of the Bund. The Italians have given the Germans a lesson which will not be thrown away on them, and the Prinmce in Germany ought, there- fore, in common prudence, to endesj'our to make their subjects contented and happy. By abrogatinu the constitution of 1831, the Bund wronged the people of Hesse-Cassel, and it added insult to injury when it in 1852 imposed a new one on them.
			The national loan has fallen 1 per cent. to-day, and the subscriptions to the loan are few and far between.

			TURKEY.
			(FROM OUR OWN CoIBSPONDNT.)
			CONSTANTINOPLE, MAnca 21.
			Great anxiety has been expressed of late concern- ing the state of affairs in Servia. Both in Turkey and abroad a general rising of the Servian and Montenegrin populations has been regarded as a matter of course. The consequence has been a con- siderable augmentation of the troops in Bosnia, and much anxious debate among the Sultan's Ministers as to the line of conduct to be pursued by the Porte. It appears to me, notwithstanding, that the internal causes of alarm have been greatly exaggerated. Prince Milosclh, no doubt, has been guflty of more than one violation of the Constitution, and has not ahvaysmauieatedacdueregardfortheauthorityof the SuzerainPower. Hehas,moreover,fairlyincurredthe charge of attemptint, by quest,ionabe means, to in- sulre the succession of his, son. The Porte, however, has shown little disposition to interfere, and it is probable that should there, on the deathj of the old Prince, be no fresh and unmiatak-able expr-ession of the public opinIon of the Principallty to the con- trary, Prince, Mchael will be recognized as his c wssor bythe Gov entoft theSult Thin might
			well bB the tce, in deference to a recent dec3dan e the Skouptchins, whicb, in theory at leut, ropre- sents the volce of the people. It is difficult to ay what may not happen in a country such as ServIs5 but it would seem to be the policyof PrinceMili and hla family to conciliate rather than alarm the susceptibilites of the Porte. A contrarycouse can only lead to the mooting of a question of the legality of the decisonin question; there should, therefore) be no further likelihood of a rupture between P einoe M3loseh and the Suzerain authority.
			On the other hand, many disturbing elementg exi. She Servian people are urgent for the with. dravwl of the Turldsh troops scattered throughout their country. Upon this, I believe, they have a right to Insist; and, in judging of the coure their Prince may take, it ihould not be forgotten thAt it is extremely difficult for a ruler in his poidtlon to refuse them his co-operation. Dix conduce on thbs point should not, therefore, be too hagdily construed into an evidence of hostility to the Sultan's Govern. ment. At Belgrzde, too, the garrison and the Ser. v'ian population of the town have been more than once on the point of coMing&amp;to blowa. Thefortre
			-the right of the Turks to garrison which no one contests-was formerly Surrounded by a vacSat pieca of ground of considerable extent. At times, whenan unusually good feeling has existed betreen the officers and e^ldiers of the garrison on the one hand, and the townspeople on the other, the lzttea have been allowed to encroach on the enienfe of the fortress, and houses have bee'i erected thereon. Over this portion of the city the Servian Executive claims to exercise jurisdiction. The Tarks, on the contrary, Maintain that, inasmuch ai the laud itsefl belongs to, and indeed forms a necemary portion o?, the fortress, the auth6rity of the SGervan lpoce can- not extend thereto. Indeed, their right to the fortres once admitted, it would seem to follow that they should even be free to clear away the bufldinLu by which its efficiency is compromised. With mora than one aspirant to the throne or at lea5t to ths succesion on the death of itspresentagedandinfinn occupant, every subject of contention between the Princo and the officers of the Sultan is naturally made the most of. Any event tending to place the family osf MEiosch in a position antagonlatlo to te Sublime Porte can rcarcely fail to serve tho interest of their rivals. Hence the importnce of a question which, itself of but little moments might easily be arranged by a slght exercise o mutual forbearance. It was the intention of the Porte to send up a commissioner to inquimr
			into, and, If possible, to adjust, the various quec. tions at isue. That project hass, I am informed, been abandoned, and a Servian deputation will ortly arrive in Constantinople to treat with the Government on the several questiona to which I have advertd. On these points the representatives of the European Powers will be entitled to make themselves heard, and under their auspices a speead
			settlement may be anticipated. It is not, after al, I think, from any internal cause that Servia may endanger the peace of Europe; neither do I believe thatthe agents of the RussEanGovernment,of whom one has heard so much, and who have undoubtedly been activ inthe Principality, are likelytocause any immediate embarrassment. Russia, no doubt, is exerting all her energies to extend her influence in that quarter,with a view to eventualities; but she can have no desire to urge the population to a present rupture withtahe Porte. if evil mustneeds come to Turkey aad to Europe, it is Austria that shall an- swer at the day of retribution. By profession one of the foremost champions of order in Europe, she lies there, the diseased spot whence all disturbances arise and spread. lI her stolid incapacity to profit by the lessons which have been read her she is driving Hungary again into rebellion, whilo it iS apparent to all the world but her own rnlers that her Slavonic provinces are only awaiting the ex- ample to rise en muasse. Servia, Bosnia, MIontenegro, and the HIersegovina would follow the lead, and mt is far from improbable that before we see the end of Austria's mixsrule in Italy we may find ourselves yet further indebted to her for a renewael of questions which the Crimean war should have set at rest for this generation.
			In Wallachia and Moldavia the election3 have been favourable, if not altogether to the present Government, at least to the cause of order. The Conservative element has been increased in the Chambers. Prince Couza's position is necessarilyone of great difficulty,butthereis groundfor hope thathe will yet conciliate some of the more moderate of the Boyards, who were duped in the matter of his elec- tion, and who have been hitherto among his bitterest enemieg, One may perhaps augur well of the tranquillity of the two Principalities from the fact that the great question of the day is whether the Prince is to wear a fez or not on the occasion of his investlture, or, to speak more correctly, of his coming to pay his respects to the Sultan at Con- stantinople. The fez is worn by all nersonr in the service of the Padisha, for which reason the Turkish authorities insist on, and the Prince objects to, its adcoption on the occaion of his visit. Far be it from me to make light of so solemn and imposing a ceremony. There are, however, those who, amazed at the excitement existing between the disputanta on so trivial a matter, incline to suggest a cap made of a description of paper that would furniheat once the material and the name best suited to all parties.
			Large secesslons from the Greek, or Orthodox, to the Roman Catholic Church have occurred of late in several parts of the Sultan's European dominions. The movement has, I take it, but little to do with doctrinal questions. The French Ambassadors and Consuls in Turkey have long held themselves out as the protectors of all Roman Catholics in this country, and a desire to obtain such protection Ope- rates more powerfullyon the mind of the GreekRlayah than allthepriestsinthe service of Rome. The convert, it is true, generally discovers in the long run that he has to a certain extent become a dupe; because, when the occasion arises for the intervention of his new patrons, he is usualy told, th1at although the French anthorities are prepared to see him freed from any persecution on account of his religion&amp; tenets, still he mus not consider that he has ceaed to be a subject of the Sultan. Nevertheless, his conversion avails him something. Should he have the nisfortune to he accused of robbery or other offence aninst the lawr, he has only to insinuate rhnt the charge is simply and solely the result of the odinm he has incurred by his change of religion, and he stands a fair chance of inducing the French Consul to interfere in his behalf, It Is not, however to this evil that I would now cal attention. The movement to which I refer has been most marked in Cand{a, whera the number of converts amounts to something like 40,000. Thn condition of this magniscent island is one of chronio disaffection, breaking from time to time into open rebellion against the authority of the Porte and the enormoun influence which France must acqu~ire thera in consequence of the pseudo-religious movement in question may be especillDy worthy of notice}. at a time when the world is bcginnlng, from. the example of his dealings in reference to Savoy, to discover that the French Emperor is. awake to substantial as well as ideal acquisitions.
			The number of Circasslan emigrants who continue to arrive here is very great. AMost of them are in. a state of utter deatitution, and, notwithstanding all the efforts of charitable Dersons in Constanti- nople, the funds subscribed for the purpose of supplying them with the bare necessarie3 of life are very nearly exhausted. I am informed that a subscription has been opened for them in lIondon. Ef this he so, I can add my testimony as to the urgency of the demanad.

			.Thuee adets to mtrhe vns ofthlasted2 monthsi support of his Arguiments. Her Majesty's Go- vernmea would wish shortly to advert also to those events.
			!' The immedistacause of the war which broke outt in Northern Italyjm the spring of last year was the invasion of the Pledmontese territory by the Austran army.
			" IThe Emperor of the Ffrench marched!a laTge foroe to the assistance and support of his ally, the Ring of Sardinia. * "The declarations whi ch His Imperial Majesty, upon se-seral occasions, made as to his Intentions, and as to the objects of the war, led the Powers of Europe to believe that the war was undertaken without any view to acquisition of territory by France, and that its object was to restoe Italy to herself and to solve, in favour of Italy, that
			q~stleu. which A, was alleged the conduct of the Austrian Gov~ernment. had brought to an Isse--namely whether Austria should have dominon up to the foot of the Alps, or whether Italy should be free from the Mediterranean t the Adriatic.
			".11. Thouvenel says that solemn acts, freely concluded after a campaignL which had been successful for the. arms of Frace, are an irrefragable proof that the French Govern- mnent had net for its object any territorial aggrandfizeent vwhen It was led by the forcea of evente to Interfere in the affairs of Italy. But he adds that though the French Govemn. 3meat could not but foresee hypothetical circumstances in which disinterestedness would have to give way to prudence, the treaties of Villafranca andl of Zurich enitirely shut out such a contingency.
			"1This stateifent seemLs to explainx the assurance given to your Excellency by Count Welewsld in July, 1859, when the Count,!behng asked as to truth of rumours that, netwvith. atanding the declrations and proclamation of the Emperor, there was a negotiation en foot for the cession of Savoy to Frncee, asserted that, if such a scheme bad ever been enter- tained, it had been then entirely abandoned.
			"Her Majestys Government are led to infer fromA31 Thouivenel?s despatch that the hypothetical contingency to 'which he alludes was the conquest of Venstia by France and, its transfer to Piedlmont, and that in such case it had
			Trety f Zric Lainglef toAusriathe possession of Ventla te ies f cesio o Saoy o rane,which it now ppers hd ben nteraind, as gvenup,as stated
			ti-. T hoenVenel however, goes on to say that combina- tions in Central italy, different from those vwhich the French Government had fruitlessly laboured to bring about, compelled theFrench Government to consider the injury vwbich newv arrangemaents In Italy might carry wtith them to the Interests of France ; anid he proceeds to argue that when Sardinia, by acquisitions of territory in Central Italy, was about to increrse her population from 4,000,000 to three times that amount, it became neces- sary, for the security of France that Savoy should be ceded to her, bn order that she might have i her own hands the
			houvherne alloegs othaet Frasice wrould ethu,s he expsed wouldd be invasion from Sardinia alone, or from Sardinla acting as o mnember of a confederation of hostile Powrs
			"Bet Her Maesty's Government would beg to observe that to imagine that Sardinia, even with a population of 32,000,000,wuder think of invading France with a populatlon of ,000,000, is to sppose that which amounts to 4 moral imposbilit . Eardinta, so augmented, will be- came a respctable State, capable of attaining a great degree of interra prosperity, and sufEclently strong to defend her- self against any other Italian Power ; hut that the French Empire, the first military Bower of the Continent, with a
			st, compact territory, full of natural resources, anda with a population characteristiesaUy warlike should be in danger of being attacked by her far weaker neighbour, is not in the nature of things. There are, besides, many political con- siderations which go to show that the tendency of Sardinia must always ho towards maintaining thte most frendly rela-
			"We may, then, at onee dismiss the notion that France can require any other guarantee than her own inherent strength affordsheragainstanyattackfrom Sardinia, acting alone.
			" But 31. Thouyend conceives that Sardinla might be a member of a confederacy arrayed agatust France, and by having both sides of the Alps she mnight open the road for other Powers to m Ake an invasion of the territory of France.
			' Now, on this Her M3ajesty's Goverment would observe that there never can be a confederacy organized against Fzance unless it be for common defence against aggressions on the part of France, and that, therefore, France haa it at all times in her own power to preven' the formation of any such confederacy. There is no Power in Europe that does not wish to maintain friendly relations with France, and there is none that conld hope to reap any advantage from a voluntar and unprovoked rupture with Eo powerful a State.
			"But the chances of Sardinia becoming an instrment of such a confederacy have been diminished by the events of lato years, and by the new arrangements of Northern and Central Italy.
			Til within the last 15 yeara the Government of Sardnlua was swayed by the influence of Austria, and rmight have been sapposed to be ILkely, in the event of a war between Anetria and France, to give passage through Savoy to any Austrisn force which might have wished to enter France in that direction; but of late yesra Sardinia has broken away from her conneoron with Austria, and has looked to France and not In vain for friendship and support. Sarditla, there- fore, is less likely than ever wilingly to Olve passage to a hostile force wishing to enter France ; and at in obvious that Sardinia, increased in strenoth, while the Austriani frontier Ssthrown back to the Minoso, is leess likely than whenx she was much weaker and when the Austrian frontier was on the Ticino, to yield on compulsion thsat pasage to Austrian troops which she would not concede of her own free will
			masin t consider, therefore, as groundless the appre- hAensionthat Sardinia retaining possession of Savoy, maght open a passage through that province into France to the Sroops of a hostUo confederacy.
			" It snees, then, to Her Majesty's Government that the argumenLt in favouar of the annexation of Savoy to France, founded on the assunmed insecurity of the French territory borderingupon Savoy, falls to the ground when it comes to be fairly examined.
			"H M. Thouvenel says that this demand for the cessIon of Savoy to France ought not to give umbrage to any Power; that at in foundedl on a just balane of frorces, and ineape- cially pointed out by the nature of things, which has placed the French system of defence at the foot of the western dlopes of the Alps.
			" But Her Majesty's Government must be allowed to re- mark that a demand for cession of a neighbour's territory made by a State so powerful as France, and whose former ancl not very remaote policy of territorial aggrandizement brought countless calamities upon Earope cannot wel fail to give umbrage to every State interested in the balance of pwer and in the maintenanco of the general peace.
			or can that umbrage be diminishedl by the grounds on which the claim in founded, because, if a pest military Power like France is to demand the territory of aneighbour uponitsowntheory of whatconstitutesgeeg,raphicallyits pro- per system ofdefenceOiti evident thatno Statecould bosecuroe from the aggressions of a moere powerful neighbour; that might, and not right, would henceforwwrd be the role to de- termine territorialpossession ; and that the integrlty and independence of th sminaller States of Europe would be
			plwel I nxualjeopardy.
			But TThouenelappeals to historical precedents in Expport of the clabm now made.
			^ Her Majesty's Govemment will not enter into an ex- amination of what took place In regard to the succession to the throne of Spain, or in regarrd totto the succession to the throne of Austria, because the transactions of those periods have no Practical applicabality to the p resent state of Euro- pean iffairs; but with regard to the later transaction to which M. Thouvenel adverts-namely, thLe arrangements of the torety of 1814-Her Majesty's Government would beg to observe that the arrangements of that treaty by no means bear out the claim now made by Frnene, and that It canot he with referaene to the stipulatiors of the
			treaty of1814that thedemand fror the cession of Savoy adif of thce cunty of y Nice can be term hedby France a 'rvendci- vendfratlon,' that it in stateon thaten prevndp fclathe a relu lorqn'ou icsbehas ste chosfmehad aqeli,eon pritend avoir
			"Now, the srrangements of the tmety of 1814 were of short duration, and, havig been superseded by these of the treaty of 1815, they cannot be appealed to as the foundation, of any right to be claimed by France.
			a"But the treaty of 1814 did not give either Savoy or the county of Nice to France.
			"1Article IIL of the treaty of 1814 did indeedl leave to France a very small portion of Savoy; but that portion was immediately contiguous to the French frontier, and was at a distance from the slopes of the Alps. The words of Article MI. on this point were as: follows :
			"' 9In the department of Mont Blanc France acquires the Suab-1preecture of Chambory,with the excepton of the can- tons of l'HODptal, St. Pierre d'Alblgny, I Rocette, and Montmnelian; and also the Sub-Prefecture of Annecy, with the exceopion of the portion of the canton of Faverges gituated to the east Of a line passing between Oarechaise and Marlens on the side of France, and Marthodi and ugine on the opposite side, andl which afterwards follows the crest of the mnountains as far as the frontier of the Can- ton of Thones. Thin line, together with the limit of the eanteuns before mentioned, shall, on this side, form the new frontier.'
			"1It follows-, therefore, from what in thus stated, that if Frasnce claims Savoy and Nice On the Principle of .s ' ro- vsndicntion,'-that In to say, on the princip le of clat&gt;uing that which sbe ba at anytimehad a rightto,-herclaim can- nlot be founded on the treaty of 1814, buLt MUSt go back to the time of the first French Emapire'; and it Is needless to
			!No L.
			point ant what just alarm the whole of Europe must feel, at a claim which howreve limited Xi Its presant application, is ssceptibleof eing extended to such vast and dangerou dimenions.
			"3L Thouvenel, Indeed, records the declaratlon sponta- neously made by His ImperHal majesty on ascending the throna%t the hovernin i rlero elationw with Eiropo
			wnd respet r r traties condluded by preceding Go- vem.ments Gt Prnee, and Mf. Thonvenel declarc thxt this is a princlple of conduct to which HImpera Majesty wi always rmake i to himself a law to remailn faithfuL
			" The declaration referred to by I. Thouvenel ws no more than might have been expected from the just and en- hghtened Sovereign by whom it was made; end the assr- ance given by M Thonvenel that It wil be strictly and inoelably observed musthe gratifying totheallies of France and satisfactojy to the whole of Europe. But M. Thonvenel alleges that the present is an exceptional case, tht changes whch havTe taken place, and which are about to takre place, in Itajly involve changes in the territorial arrangements established by existing -treaties, aLnd that these treaty arrangements ought net to be altered to the detriment of
			"Her Majesty's Government think they have shown that no detriment or danger to France would be the result of the changes nowr in progress In Italy; but there is a State in whose integrity and independence aU Europe takes a deep interest, and whose integrity end independence France, among other Powers, has pledged herself by treaty to re- spect and maintain, and that State would suffer the most serious detriment, and would be exoxgsed to the most serious danger, by the proposed transfer of Savoy from Sardinia to France. It is needless to say that this State Is Switzerland.
			" By the Treaties of Vienna of 1815 the Powers of Europe, France included, acknowledged and guaranteed the integrity and the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland, and as a esecurity for that integrity and that neatrality It was stipulated that the provinces of Chablais and of Fancigny and all that portion of Savoy which is north of UYglne, shall form part of the neutrality of Switzerland, as'acknowledged and guaranteed by the contracting Powers; and It was further stipulated that, In consequence thereof, whenever the Powers, neighbonrs of Swltzerland, shonld be actually at war, or whenever there should be an imminent danger of war between them, the trooep of the King of Sardinla, the Sovereign of Savoy, which may happen to be in those provinces sbaU retire therefrom, passing, if neces- sary, through the Valais, and that no armed troops of any other Power shall elther traverse or be stationed in those provinces and territories, except such troops as the Swiss Confederation sball think proper to place therein.
			" It is plain that these engagements abont Savoy, to which France is a party, were intended as a security for Switzer- land against danger coming from France; but what would become of that security if Savoy were annexed to France, and if the very Power against which this access to Switzer- land has been barred should become the owner of the barrier thus erected for the protection of the Con- federation ? It Is, indeed, Implied in the despatch of bL Thouvenel that France, in taking Savoy, would accept also the engagements by which the King of Sardinla is bound, In regard to the neutralzed portion of that country ' but it is no disparagement to France to say that neither ;witzerland nor the Powers of Europe could con- sider such an arrangement as affording to the integrity and neatrality of the Swiss Confederation that security which theabove-mentioned stipulations of theTreaty of Vienna are calculatedto afford; and Her Majests Government oontend that it is not competent for France and Sardinia, by the compact between them, and without the coment of the other States of Europe, so materially to Impair, as the pro- posed cession of Savoy would do, an element of security which a great European comrsct has provided for a State whose independenre is an object of European concern.
			"Nor can it he for the well-understood interest of France berself to break down the barriers by which the neutrality of Switzerland is secured. It must surely be aclnowledged that the nentrality of Belgium at the northern and of Switzerland at the southern extremity of the eastern frontier of France Is of advantage to her, as well as to Europe. The nentrality of those two States narrows the line of frontier along which hostilities between France and C-ermany can take place and adding to the security of both, It tends to give' stability to the general peace. 3f. Thonvenel alleges that the proposed cession of Savoy and the county of Nice to France raises no question incompatible with the best established and most rigorous rules of public law. He points to similarity of eharacter, of language, of habits; to the geographical con- figuration, and to comnmercial intercourse, as baving pre- pared and adapted tho people of those countries' for annexa- tion to France; and he says that the Alps ought to be the line of separation between France and Italy, and that thus the new boundary which it is proposed to establish be- tween France and Piedmont finds its sanction in the force o! things. This statement, indeed, opens a wide field for con- jecture as to the future, and though It is Immediately fol- lowed by the somewhat inconsistent assurance that it Is not upon the ground of ideas of nationality, nor upon that of natural frontiers, that the cession of Savoy and of Nice is demanded, those argumeents cannot fail to give rise to the most serious reflections. Her Majesty's Government, then, would beg to eubmit that no case has been made out to justify this cession on the ground of necessary defence for France, and that this cession would most unjustly, and in violation of treaty engagements materiaUy weaken a defensive arrangement which united Europe has provided as a security for the neutrality and integrity of Switzerland.
			"Great Britain has no direct interest of her own in this matter, and it is from no unfriendly feeling towards France that her remonstrances on this subject have proceeded. Her Mfajesty's Government, indeed, are deeply impressed with the conviction that any territorial advantage which France might gain by the proposed annexation would be far more than counterbalanced by the distrust with which it wonld inspire the other States and Powersof Earope.
			"The calamities which overpread by turns almost every part of the continent of Europe during the closing years of the last and the early years of the present century are stil fresh the memory of makind; their renewal would, indeed, he a deplorable misfortune, and it cannot be surprising that the attention of nations and of their rulers should be directed, with anxious solloitude, to events which have a bearing both on the interests of the present and on the destinies of the future.

			The following is the latest despatch addressed to this Court by Al. ThouveneL Lord Cowley, how- ever, sends a copy of the Treaty of Annexation, which we have already published. It wfill be seen that France accepts Savoy r with its engage- ments":-
			(Translation.)
			"Paris, March 26, 1860.
			"1. le Comte,-I have the honour to transmit to you herewith cony of the despatch from Lord John Russell, which Earl Cowley has been instracted to communicate to me officially, and which contains the reply of the Govern- ment of Her Britannic Majesty to the statement of the Government of the Emperor, concerning the annexation of Savoy and the arrondissement of Nice to France.
			* I cannot but experience a very lively feeling of regret that I have not succeeded, as I desired, In modifying an opinion which was already known to me through the pre- vious communications of the English Ambassador; bat the prolongation of any discussion on this subject would have no practical result, and I prefer, rather than provoke a fresh exchange of explanations equaUy painful to both countries, to confine myself to asserting that Lord John Russell's despatch has not the character of a pro- test. In a word, the Government of Her Britsnnic majesty declares that It does not share the opinlon of the Government of the Emperor; but this divergence does not constitute an opposition of a nature to affect the relations of the Cabinets of Paris and London. I am sincerely pleased at this, ML le Comte; and there are only two points in Lord John Russell's argument which I wish to examine summa- rily, so as to leave in the mind of Her Britannic Majesty's principal Secretary of State neither a misunderstasiding nor a doubt as to our Intentions. I believed that I had esta- blished that the Emperor, in maldng use in his speech to the great bodies of the State of the word Irevendication,' had never had an idea of referring to any diplomatic act, or to any circumstance of other times. The explanations which I have given on this subject to His Majesty's repre- sentatives at the German Courts have been everywhere con- sidered as satisfactory as possible, and I had requested you to transmit to Lord John Russell a copy of the despatch which contains them. I renew these explanations to-day with the confidence that on examining them closer, Her Britannic Majesty's dovernment will not receive them less favourably than the Powers to whom they were more espe- cially addressed.
			"As for the neutrality of Switzerland, N1. le Comte, which Lord John Russell considers to be menaced by) the annexation of Savey to the' territory of the Empire, I wvil content myself with remarking to you that France attaches the greatest interest to preserving it from any injury. The Emperor's Government, therefore, has not hesitated, In order to prove the sincerity of its dis- position In this respect, to insert in the treaty which it has lust concluded at Turin a clause in these terms *-
			"'It is understood that HisMajesty the King of Sardinia cannot transfer the neutralized portions of Savoy except on the conditions upon which he hlmself possesses them and that it wvil appertain to His Majesty the Emperor of the French to come to an understanding on this 6nbjeot, both with the Powers represented at the Congress of Vienna and with the Swiss Confederation, and to give them the guaran- tees required by the stipulations referred to in this article.'
			It appears to me that all apprehensions should disappear in face of this spontaneous engagement, and that hence- forth Her Britannio Majestys Government, certain of having the opportunity of discussing the gunantees which shall, in purmance of an European agreement, be judged to be best fitted to realize, in their relations with the per- manent neutrality of Switzerland, the object of the stipula- tions relative to the contingent neutralization of a part of Savoy, has no reason to fear that this interest, the import- ance ot which we have thus recognized, will not be settled in a satisfactory manner.
			" You are authorized to read this despatch to Lord John Russell, and to give him a copy of It.

			THE HAscwic Ex roN.-An arrangement has been concluded between the Conservative candidates. Mr. Crookshank will give way to Colonel Bowley,who has oledges of support from many :electors who polled for himn at the previous election.

Montagn Chambers' friends state they are confident of success from his favourable reception among them recently, and believe that a retirement of the other Liberal candidates will be eftected In his favour. The Liberals are very anxious that their candidates may agree as to which shall contest te borough, aparty contest appeasing cert&amp;in.

			THE TYNE HARBOUR OF REFUGE.
			The Marquis of CLAN~RICARDE wished to correct a statement he had made the other evening with reference to the sum expended on the workls now in progress at the mouth of the Tyne. He had read from the report of the Harbour of Refuge Commissioners that the sum oef 7650,0001. was recommended by them as the total cost. of efficient works for a good harbour of refuge at the month of the Tyne. That was qoite correct; bet he stated Incidentally that 50p,0001. of this sum had been already expended, which hefound was not thefact. sud a mactuallylaidout was only 142,0001.

			IRISH ELECTORAL RiITUIUNS,
			Tshe Marquis of CLANRICARDE toved for retarns of all towns in Ireland, exclusive of Parliamentary boroughs, containing a population of 4,000 or upwards, specifying the county in wnich each such town is situated, and show. ing the number of occupyers rated at above 41. and under 61., and at of. and 'apwvards but under SZ., and at Sp. The noble lord In doing so too: occasion to say that the Irish Reform Bill which had been introduced into the other House of Parliamenit was, in his opinion, so complete a mockery that he could not understand why tho Govern- ment had taken the trouble to bring it forward. So strongly did he entertain that view with respect to it, that if it should ever come up to their lordshipa' House, -which he hoped would not be the case, he shoul'd deema it to be his duty to oppose its passing into a law. For his own part he had not heard that any deuce for Parliamentary Reform had been exmbited in Ireland, or that the question waas one which had taken thD slightest hold of the minds of the Irish people. But if it were deemed necessary that some alteration in the electoral system In that country should be made, he thought due consideration should be shown for these large conLstituencies which were not adequately represented. He might also observe that there were in Ireland boroughs so poor and haviog constituencies so smal that they were to a great extent, if not altogether, subject to proprietary in.
			fi that it was exoedient in any mecare of reform wX.hichmiht be' pased that they should be placed upon~1 some more satisfactory footing thian that upon which thy at present stood. Hle held, for example, in his handl a re- turn of no less than 16 boroughs not one of which had a constituency exeeeding 300 registered elector, and that number, ft must be borne In mised, was consderably larger than the numberwho voted at the lastgeneral election. He might add that of the 16 boroughis to which he had alluded six had a constituency of less than 200, so that they afforded a good ground for the hand of the Reformer to work upon. And how, let him ask, was it proposed to deal with them In the Government measutre? According to certain returns which had been laid, before the House, the result of the change which that measure proposedl to effect wonid be that - not one of these boroughs would have a constituency of 400 ; that 12 would still have a constituency of lees than 300, and 4 a constitnency of less than 200. That being the probable operation of the measure, ho could not, as he had said before, look upon it otherwise than as a perfeet mockery of reform. Now, what he should propose wrould he to group those boroughs In such away as that they might have a constituency somewhat resgpectable in point of numbers-inx each a. way, for in- stance, as that no constituency shouldI number below 500, while the population which it represented should not be less thanl12,000. HTehad sug~gested that the largeoconstituencies in Ireland were inadequately represenited, and he might, in support of that opinion, mention the county of Cork, which, with a population of 563,000 and 15,700 electors, had alto- gether only six. members; the county of Down, which, writh a population of 32S,000 and a constituency exceeding 11,000, had only three members; Tipperary, which, with a populationx of 331,600 and 9,467 electors had only four members ; and Galway, which, witli a population of 297,000 andI a number of electors ex- ceeding 5,000, had only two members. There was also the county of Dublin, which, although the number of its Inha- bitants wras not more thanl143,000, yetwagsof grezterimport- ance, and which, with a consti'uoncy of 6,200, re'turned only two members. Those were, In his opinion, points wvell worthy the attention. of the Government in dealing with the subject of Irish Parliamentary Reform.
			The Duke of NEWCASTLE saidl the noble marquis had not merely anticipated the discussion of that Reform 'Bill which he had expressed a hope would not come up to their lordashipe' House from the House of Commons, but had, to a certain extent, sketehed cutea counter-measure of his own. Now, while his wishes with respect to the fate of the Ge- vermmecet Bill were quite different from those which his noble friend entertained, he munst decline following him into a dliscussion of the details of that or any other measure which might be introducedl on the subject. The GovernmenLt Bill involved, he was prepared to admit, no proposals of Immense magnitude. It was not, for instance, of a charac- ter IIto take away one's breath," if he mlight be allowed the use of an expression which ho had of late on one or two occasions seen In print. He might, however, observe that the Irish people would net, in all probability, be disposed to think that equal justice had been dealt out to them if the small boroughs In that country were, as the noble marquis suggested, to be disfranchised, while no such course was to he adopted in England. The noble marquis seemed tobe of opiniona that It wotlId be advisable that a certain number of those boroughs should be grouped together, but in order to effect that object it would be necessary to alter the propor- tion of the borough to the county representation, Inasmuch as no substitute could otherwise be found for those boroughs he wished to see disfranchised. He might add that the population in boroughs and that In counties in Ireland stood to one another in proportions different from that which was the case in England or Scotland. The county popula-

			The Marquis of CLANRICARDE sald he did not propose that any disfranchisement should take place In Ireland, except to the extent which was contemnlated in England, by depriving constituencies of one membeiwhen the population was below a certain amount. The boroughs of Athlone and Portarlington each returned a member to Parliament. He found that under the Government Reform Bill four addi- tional voters would be added to the constituency of Athlone, which would thus amount to 258- the increased roll of votersforPortartHngtonweuld number 140. He did not believe that by grouping these boroughis together, and allot- ing one of their members to some large constituency, any injustice] would be done to the 398 voters of whom the joint constituency would then be composed.
			The motion for the returns was then agreed to.
			OLD SMITH1ELD.,AKaET.
			Lord EBBRY asLed whether it was the Intention of Her Majests Government to alow any portion of the site of old Smithfield-market to be appropriated for bnUildin pur- poses. The ground had been granted to the Corporation of the City of London as long as it should continue to be used for a meat-market, but when it ceased to be sed for that purpose the land reverted again to the Crown. Since, thezefore, the cattle-market had been removed to Copenhagen-fields, there could be no doubt that the space on which it had been formerly held, oon- sdsting of about 4, acres, absolutely belon ed to the Crown. H:o had accompanied deputations botl to the noble lord at the head of the late Government and the noble viscount who was at the head of the present Ad- ministration, and had received assurances in each case that this vacant space should not be built over. The question was one of vital importance to the health of that locality, for in no part of London was there a more dense and squalid popnultion thanHlved in the immediate neighbourhood of Smithfield. That district was bounded on the south by Snow-hill and on the north by Clerkenwell-green, and there was no other place where the children could talke exercise save in the closest and densest courts. Since the removal of the market the space had been left exactly In its orlginal condition, and a perpetual invitation was thereby held out to persons to bring plans without nm=ber for turning It to different purposes, one of these being that it should be converted into a dead meat-market. Another proposal was to erect on it a great railway terminus in con- rienon with some of the metropolitan lines. He contended that Government, in the interests of the public, ought at once to have taken possession of it, and he believed the money which wlould be required to rail it off and render it suitable as a playground for the children reSident in the neighbourhood would be readily voted by Parlament. He trued thenoble lord would be able toasure him that the
			not be appropriated for the purpose of clil the 0or ment would prevent attc1;s
			from bMing mtde on it by the covetousness of the city of London.
			Tho Duke of NEWCASTLEB sd Lis noble friend bid not mentioned the fact, of which he was doubtless aware that the Corporation of London had a Bil before the Eouso for the purpose of sanctionlng the formation of a dead meat- market. The promoters had been In communication with the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and though no decision had been yet arrived at, he was bonad to etate that he had not received tho proposal unfavourably. He did not knowin what stage the Bil was at presentin the other House, but he apprehended that some arrangement involving the sanction of the Crown would have to be made bofore the m easure could pass,
			STAMP DTU S B1TJ.
			On the motion for the second reading of this Bill,
			The Dake of NEWCASTLE eaid,-If I rlghtly under-
			stand the wish of the House, from the desire which was ex1 presed on a former day by two or three noble friends, and from the tacit assent of the remainder, I apprehend that it is not now desired to enter into a discussion either of this measur or of the Income-tax Bi, but that a discussion shall take place on the general financial scheme of the Go- vernment when some three or four other Bills are brought before us. If that be the feeling of the House, I shall act more In conformi'y with it by abstaining from debating the question, or fromdefendlng an enactment whichthere isno de- sire at present to assail (hear); and I shaU simply explain to your lordships thatthe general scopo of this Bill is to e. tend to various other articles of agreement in writing that principle of penny taxation which has been adopted with very great success for some years, and has produced, on the whole, a very considerable rovenue. It was first adopted in tho case of the Post-office by a noble friend when Chancellor of the Exchequer in a former Govern- ment. It was carried further by my right hon. friend the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, who Imposed an uniform rate of id. on rceipt stamps; a step further was mado by tho Chancellor of the Exchequer of the late Government when he imposed a slmilar stamp on hoankers' checks; end we nowv propose toextend the principle considerably farther by imposing a llke tax on various other documents. I do not now enter into tho question of stamps for a higher amount which are to be found in the pGresent Bill. I am quite aware that ohjectifos have been raised to the measure on the ground thab it inter- feres with trade and creates impediments of an un- dosiratlenature. Itis impossible to deny that any tar
			howeversmall, mustrhave that tendency; but when it is oelieved-whether rightly or wrongly, I purposely abstain from entering into that question-that the general measures of theoGovernment ace largely calculated for theorelief of the trade of the country, weo have thought it not unfair that it should be called on to contribute to the revenne to an extent which it is well able to hear. Wjtlt thls short explanation, I beg now to move the second reading of the B331, with the intimation that, if your lordships should be willing to agree to it, I shall then move the suspension of the Standing Orders No. 37 and 38, with a vlew to both Bills being road s, third time and passed.
			The motion for the second reading was then agreed to; and, the Standing Orders having been suspended, the Bill was read a third timo and passed.
			INCOME-TAX BILL.
			The Dake of NEWOASTLB, in moving the second read. ing of thiS Bill, said he should defer to another occasion the explanation of the grounds on which an additional penny was Imposed, and why the operation of the Bill was con- fined to one year.
			The Bill wasread a second time; and, in this case also the Standing Orders having been suspended, it was immediately read a third time and passed.
			Their Lordships adjourned shortly before 6 o'clock.

I shall nob fail to give such directions as may appear to me best calculated to promote the object which you have in view."
			TEE REFORM BILL.
			Mr. D. GRIFFITH gave notice that at the proper time he should move that it should be an instruction to the com- mitteo upon the BiU to amend the representation of the people, that no borough shbuld be deprived of one of its memberaj until it had been ascertained by actual census whecher or not its present population fell below 7,000.
			ANTNEXATION OF SAVOY.

(Hear, hear.) We have thought ib right to lay beforo Parliament the corre- spondence with N. Thouvenel, and in answer to a despatch which has already appeared In the publie papers. That correspondence closes with a despatch from M. Thouvenel. We have replied on our part that we intend to keep the question of the neatralized parts of Savoy separate from the general question of the annexation of that province. (Eear.) TherearelikewixeamongthiscorrespondencepapersfromSwit- zerland, containing anappeslto the GreatPowers who signed the Treaty of Vienna on behalf of the neutrality of Switzer- land, and a request that those Powers will meetin conference upon the subject. We have expressedno objection to golng into conference, if that should be thought the best mode of dealing with the question. The papers also include a copy of the Treaty of Turin, which has been communicated both by Lord Cowley and Sir James Hudson. In the second article of that treaty it is stated that it wiU be for the Em. peror of the French to come to an understanding with the other Powers wlth respect to the neutralized portions Of Savoy. (Hear, hear.) We conclude, therefore, that there wlll be a serious examination of this important question, that it will be discussed with reason on all sides; and we hope that such propositions may be made as will bh satisfac tory to Switzerland, and wi meet the views of the Powers of Europe generaly. (Hear, hear.)
			LIGHTS AND BUOYS.
			M1r. RIDLEY aslked the right hon. gentleman the Presi- dent of the Board of Trade whether the Commissoners ap- pointed on the 3d day of December 1858, to inquire into the condition and maanagement of lights, buoys, and beacons had made their report; and, if so, when he would lay it upon the table of the House.
			hlr. T. S. GIBSON replied that the report of the com- mission had not yet been made but'he believed that it was being prepared, and would be laid before the public during the present year.
			of which would be to exempt from cha any removal of goods tnder bond from one port or place to another.
			The Committee divided, whn the nuinbers were :-
			For the amendment ... 50 Against it ... ... . *.. .. 64
			lffajority ... ... ... ..-14
			Mr. CHILDERS suggested that the Imposition of a small anuaul chage upon bonded warehouses wounld enable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to raiseathe revenue he ex- pected from this source. As ho could not move his proposi- tIon s a amendment at presmnt, hie would propoie the re- iection of the resolution.
			Mfr. AMILER seconded the proposition for the rzejectlon of the resolution, hating great objections to the charge upon the removal of goods.
			M1r. VAINCE said the Import charges upon goods enterlng the port of Dublin ere already very heavy, aId it would be almost ruinous to the trade of that clty.to impose this addi- tional charge. With reference to the statistlcs of taxation In Ireland, he denied that Ireland paid lesa than her- fair proportion; but the truth was that upon many articles of consumption, such as tea and sugar, the duties were paid in Liverpool or London before their exportiaton to Ireland.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXHEQUER said the question of tho statistics of Irish taxation ha d already boen under discussion that evening, and the Government in- tended to maske inquiries with a view to ascertain whether those statistics could be improved. W-ith respect to the motion for rejecting the resolution the seconder had based his supporS of that motion upon his. objection to the charge upon removals. That charge was only a matter of 8,000t. or 10,000!, but the whole resolutionc involved a sum of 50,0001., and surely the hon. member would not deprive the revenue of that amount simply because he obh jested to the smaller sun? eo*eoially as there would be other opportunities for explaining his objections to the charge upon t e removal of goods. The suggestion of the hon. member for Pontefract to imposo an annual tax upon each bonded warehouse was most startling, and one that he did not think the House would agreo to. There were 1,200 bonded ware- houses in tho country, and to cao upon the proprietors of those warehouses to pay 60,000!. a-year,at a time when Par- liament by remitting duties was excluding from them a large class of goods, was too violent a proposition. The 40,000!. upon warehousing ;as generally recognised ag a fair charge by the retail dealers who lvonld have to pay it, and he thought the committee would not deprive the revenue of that amount because of any objection to a lesser amount for removals.
			Mr. CHILDERS remarl-ed that the principle had alwrays been laid down by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it was the consumer who paid the taxes upon all artioles.
			Mtr. CRUET EWING objected to the favour shown to sugar
			for refineries.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUTER was willing to omit the wvords " for refineries."
			Mr. CRUM-E WING.-Aud rum ?
			The CHANCELLOR of the lEXCHEQUER said ruuu had, by the accident of legislation, actualy obtained a pro. tooting duty, and therefore he would recommend the hon. member not to enter upon any discussion upon that subject.
			Mr. T. BARING asked whether It was intended to pas the resolutlon as it stood, or was there to bh any modifica- tion ?
			The CHIANtCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER reptied that tho only modification would ba that in the place of the word "duties" would be substituted " dues," or " charges," end he also proposed to strike put the words " for refineries."
			Sir H. CAIRNS asked whether it was worth while to create so much dlssatisfaotion at tho outports as this charge was sure to produce for so small a sum as 10,000. or 12,0001. ? He hoped tho Chancelor of the Exchequer would give way upon the point when the Bllvrent into com- soittee.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER would re- peat what he had already explained to the House, that the charge was not imposed for purposes of revenue, but to pre- vent the Indefinite extension of bondingwarehouses in small inland towns.
			Sir H. CAIRNS objected to the largo outports being com- pelled to pay in order to make up for the deficiency of smaU places.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the hon. member for Glasgow would have an opportunity of moving an amendment if he thought fit when the BWI went into committee. The hon. member could not object to a charge on the removal of goods, but he objected to the large ports being exposecd to that charge.
			Sir T. COLEBROOaE thought the smal places should b= required to pay their own expenses, and hoped the Ohan- celor of the Exchequer would not insist on suoh a petty tax as tbat now proposed.
			Mr. CRAUFURD said tho operatlon of the chargo would be to give an undue advantage to the port of London over the smaller ports. He trusted the Chancolor of th E x- chequer would give way to the strong feeling that kad been expressed on the subject.
			The rosolution was then agreed to, with the omission of the words " for refineries."
			The CHIAIRAIAN reported progress, and the House re- sumed.
			REFRIESHMENT HOUSES_AND WINE LICENCES
			The adjourned debate on the second reading of thiB Bill (March 26) was resumed by
			Mfr. CROOK, who said the Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated that there were two parties who objected to this Bill. He roso to advocate theclaims of one of these parties, for he represented that large section of the community (ex- cluding the licensed victuaUers) who had petitioned against this Bill. With the licensed victuaUer he had nossympathy. He simply advocated the opinions whicb the Temperance Societies of this countrv had expressed in their petitions. They did not ask the House to prevent foreign wines from coming into this country, bht they joined Issue with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he asserted that the pre- sent measure would be productive of temperance and sobriety. N'ot less than 1,200 petitions, with about 120,000 signatures, had been presented against this Bill. In tle borough he represented (Bolton) two large open-air meetings bad declaredl aainst the BilL Petltions from every congre- gation in the borough, from SQ out of 48 members of the Town-Council, and from many manufacturers and shop- keepers had also been presented aasinst it. Ile was not aware that any petitions had been presented in favour of the mea- sure from any part of the country, nor did he know any one who wanted this Bill. The friends of temfperance maintained that the present facilities for the distribution of other in- toxicating liquids were amply sufficient for the sale of wine also. There were not less than 105,000 persons specially set up by the law to ad minister to the comforts or to cor- rupt, demoralie, and debase the people, and to increase this number wvould only increase the facilities for temptation. In the borough of Bolton there were 120 publichouses and 240 beerhouses, which was quite enough for a population of 60,000 persons. It was estimated that anc equal number of shops would take out wine licenees unuder this Bill and there was a danger that young people, and especially servants, would resort to those shops. Such heuases would be far maore dangerous than pubichoitses and beershops. They would sell wine of every quality,from champagne tothegreateet rubbish sold iunder the name of wine. The provisions of the Bill were in direct opposition to the recommendations of the committee of inquiry which sat in 1854, and their effect would be to render refreshment-houses attractive, dangerous, and un- manageable in the higbest degree. The leading principle of the committee's report was, that the facilities for the dls- tribution of intoxicating drinks should ba largely re- duced, while the object of the Bil was to ex- tend them indefinitely. There was no evidence that such a measure was wanted, and he was sure it passed it vuc Som alqqlale html, Should the Honse unfortu- nately agree to it, he ho2ed they would at least provide that ft should be suspended m any district where two-thirds of the ratepayers were opposed to it. Ho trusted, however, that they would reject' it altogether, nd therefore moved that it he read a second tlme that day six months.
			Dr .I. SEYMOUR, in seconding the amendment, said no on th habit of attending the criminal courts could resist the conviction that three-fourths-he might say five- sixths-of the crime of the country was directly referrtble to the demoralizing Influences of the low publichouses and beershopa. (Hear, hear.) Ho opposed the Bill on fiscal, eanltaryt and moral grounds. Hie owned ho did not look forwrd t an gret icreae o refeshent-houses from the operation of theD Bill, and therefore he thoghtthoficalbenfis aticpaed romitby the Chancellor of the Exchesquerbgtreeatly ea gogernciated.Lih
			and It was stated by Mr. M'Calloch that the only efect
			a reduetion of duty would be a redactton of revenue. TL-e Chancelor of the Exchequer promised good and wholesome wvine at a cheap rate, but the cloven foot was revealed by the Batoraonsf, in which paper he observed it stated that French wines might be easily strengthened for the Brttish palate by the introduotion of a little brandy. (Hear,) It was patent to every one that the advantage which the French expected was not a better market for good wine, but a mar- ket where they could get rid of their bad vintages. (Hear.) In the words of Horace,-
			"Vile potabls modlcis Sabinum
			"C antharis,"
			which he might familiarly translate, " They were to drlnk wretched claret out of pewter pots." (Laughter.) These had been no demand for this Bill by the public; and, although there had been hundreds of petitions from per- sons, independent of publicans and teetotallers, against it, he had not heard of a single petition in its favour. It was a fallacy to suppose that in wine-growing countries the populationt were more sober. He believed that the cen- sumption of alcohol was more than double per head in France that which it was in England, and he was supported in that opinion by the observations of such men as Horace Greely and Fenimore Cooper. The lnducements to drink in England were abundantly sufficient and the Legislature ought to pause before they thrustupon thepeople greater facilities and temptations. The process o reasongi was that because there mnst he a treaty with F
			must be freely admitted, the revenue must suffer, and to re- cover the loss this Bill must be passed; but that was a line of argument agaiost which he protested. (Eear, hear.) Be- sides the objections which he entertained against the prin- ciple of the measure, he must say that in the form in which it now appeared it was the most clumsy piece of legWiation he had ever seen in his life. Every shopkeeper, whether a tailor or tobacconist, might take out a licence, and every customer night bo exposed to the temptation of this wine being reommended by the shopkeeper. Every oysterman and every orangewoman would be obllged to takeout a licence, and the evil which would follow was that, with a French wine BiU they would introduce a French police. (Cheers.) Itwasnotatthedictatlonofthetemperancesocleties, but by his own istinct, as a lover of constitutional freedom, that he implored the House not to sancton such anqni- sitorial system as would allow the police to come intohonest mens' houses,whether they cold wine or not, simply because they were obliged to take out a licence. (Hear, hear.) In the neighbourhood of Southampton there were many beau- tiful spots to which picnic parties resorted in the summer months, and any one who allowed the usa of a room wherein they might consume
			THE BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.
			Lord 3. RUSSELL moved that upon Thursdays, after Easter andl tll Whitsuntide, Government orders of the day should have precedence of notices of motion.'
			Colonel W. PATTEN had no wish to embarrass the Go- vernment in the conduct of the public bnsiness, and was convinced that difficulties had been thrown in their way which would shortly render necessary the adoption of come remedial measures (hear, hear); but at the came timne he thought that it was rather early in the sssion for the Ministry to take possession of Thursday, which was one of the only two dayc a week that independent members had for their motions. (Hear, hear.) After Whitsuntide Thure- days were of no use to independlent members, because they had then no hop of passing measures wvhich they might introduce through their subsequent stages. The practice of discussing questions raised by private maembers on Friday evenings had during the last three weeks caused consider- able inconvenience, and, if it continued, it would cOOn be necessary to adopb aeme asrangement for the more equal division of the time of the HIouse between the Government and independent members. During the last few weeks the Government, instead of having two evenings a week for their business, had only had Mondayj and three or four hours on Friday. (Hear, hear.) On Friday last, for in-. stance, the debate npon the adjournment of the House lasted co long ,that the Bils of the Chancelor of the Ex- chequer did not come on until 1 or2 o'dock-in the morning, when they were considered so hurriedly that he beieved sundry errors had crept into them. He was of opinion, under these circumstances, that come better arrangement but at the came time he thought thatitwas only fair to
			privtemmbersthat the proposition nomaebthnbl lord ahould be deferred till a later period of the osin (HeaLr, hear.)
			Mr. W. S. LINDSAY said that there was no precedent for takingThursdays away from independent members until after Whitsuntide, and he did not wlsh to create one. (Hear, hear.) If they gave the Government too much time, they might be disposed to bestow less care and attention upontheirmeasures. Headmitted that Independentmembers frequently occupied too much time on Friday evenings, but thought that some arTangement might he made to meet that evil. TheGoverrment nowhadhionclays,Fridayg, and Wed- nesdays-("No, no.") Well, then he would say Mondays andFridays, they had the came right of balloting for Tees- days and Thursdays as wo enjoyed by other members, and they had this advantage, that they had greater facilitiEs for k-eeping a Hence, though on a recent occasion even they had not foand that task a very esy one. (" Hear, hear,5 and a lQugh.) The only object of the Government in takitg theso Thursdays must he to gain mere time for mo med - ctres. The Budget, which, in his oPinion, was a great and well-oconsidered measure, had not occupied more time than was aboblutely necessary, and was now pretty far advazned. Another great measue, the Bakruptcy Bill, had been so well conidered alnd matured by the Attorney-General that It hadl passed its first two stages without opposition. Hrad tfhe amendment of the representation of the people bean as well considered, and th views o persons both in end out of that House conerning it as well ascertained, ho holered that a measre upon' the subject-he did not cay one that would have satisfied all parties, but one that would have been generally acceptable to the country-might have been passed. in a fortnight. He was afraid the Reform Bill giuld occupy montha in committee, and perhaps fall to give satisfaction after all. Ho thought the Government should not reek to deprive private members of Thursday till after Whiteuntide.
			IThe CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the de- mand which the Government had made was one promoted by their sense of public duty and public convenlence,-and by a regard to the state of public busines. There was no charge which he had heard mere freqently brought against Administrations than that, by introdiucing their Important measures at a very late period of the cession they had ren- dered it impossible for the House to give tieem due atten. tlon, and so had caused funnecesary delay in legis- lation. Whatever relse mnight be said of the present Government, it -wouald, he thought, he admitted that they had used great pains to be prepared at the ouLtset of tho eassion wsith their most important mea-. sures. Heow did those measures stand? If, as stated by the lest speaiker, the Reform BUIl would occupy months in committee, that was a reason for taldng time in discussin, it. The Attorney-General had very carefully considcreA the Banluutoy BUIl, but he believed It to be the expecta- tion of his hon. and learned friend himself that, however well-maxtured, that measure must necessariy from its nature occrupy a considerable portion of the time oDf the House
			and it was oovious that unless they were able to send &amp;ia Bill to the House of Lords at a comparatively early period of the year it could not be passed Into law during the pre- sentsession. It was true that, owing tothe kudnessgof the House, very considerable progress had bc!en made wilth the financial measures of the Government, but, at the same time, he could not calculate upon requiring les than from four to six entire evenings after Easter, in order to get rid of various questions that still remained for discussion, in connexion, for example, with the Wino Icences Bill, the paper duty and the malt drawback. They were also an an extremely isawiarcl state with regard to supply, and the House would he aslked to devote several evnnsbefore Whitsantiae to that department of puxblic buies Hitherto the Government had made two en- croachmentg upon the time belonging toaprivate members, but, on the other hand,thiown time ha been practically reduecd from two evenings to one evening and a half per week. Between Easter and Whitsuntide there would be about five week's available for discussion, which represented, according to the existn aragemnent, ten dlays availble for the Government. Nocw=, sleveral nights would have to be given to the estimates, from four to six wouldl be re-

			those reawon-s wbloah ought to indauce t.he House to comply with it. (Hear, hear.) Tho motion had been made without the noble lord condescending to offer a single reason in i6s favour . and, though the Chancellor of the Exchequer had brought his great powers o argument to Its support, notiing could bh more mnsatiafcctry thal the result of his reason. iug. It was neither more nor less than that private mem- bers should reaUy have no days at al-that the Government busine-s would have been much meor advanced, and would have been altogether in a more satisfactory state, if hon. gentlemen had not exercised their privi- leges on the two days of the week which they at pre- sent enjoyed. (Hear, hear.) The Chmnoollor of the Exehe. q.uer bad, Indeed, nosed one other argument-riz, that the Governmlent had suffered much from the existin" rra&gt;nct. ment with respect to Friday; but he beggedtoremind ths rlght-bhon. gentleman that it was tho head of his own Go- vernment, the leader of that House, who opposed the mo- tion which would havo put an end to that which many hon. gentlemen thought a great inconvenience and an abuse. He agreed on the whole, though with conditions, to thecourse taken tythlasnoble viscount; hutlit was not open to the Chmn cellor of the Exchequer, on the part oF the Government, ti&gt; complain nowv of the conduct of the House with respect to&gt; proceediinos on the motion for adjournment on Friday, when the Government, by their principal representative, bad do. cided that the existing arrangement was convenient to the House and advantageous to the cundet of public bus! ness. (RIear,hear.) Xor, speak;ing generally,had the Go- vernmentany right to cmplainofthe manner in which their measures had been receved and treated by the House, A legitimate opportunity had, no doubt, been talken to oppose their very considerable fnnaolal measures on prIn- cple, buttherehadbeen even a studlious attempt not to embarrass them on matters of detsil, and the tonsequence had been that maEy of their mesres bad been passed, and all of them greatly advanced before Easter. (lIear, hear.) I appeared tohim, therefore, tit the Governmentht wera nowemaking a somewhat unreasonablo demand, especIally sinre they had already been permitted to avai themselves ot several evenings which propery belonged to private members. (lear, heast)
			Lord PAdIaERSTON acknowilen gd that the Important measures w;hich the Government bad brought forward bad been treated in the firest possible spirit of discbTsslon vitb perhaps, the exception of the Reform Bill. (LauGhter.j There had been no delay beyond what was necessry to enable members to state their opinions, and he therefore entirely repudiated the notion that the present motion was made in any degree in a spirit of blame. The motion wa
			net brought forward simply in the interest of the Govern. ment, for it was no great matter to them how long the session might last; but tho motion was proposed in the interest of the publio servlces and of the House itselft (Hear, hear.) It was well -nown that it was usu4 at a later period of the session for the House to grant what was nOw asked, on the greund that there was a pressure of business, and that unless Govern- ment orders had precedence on Thursdays the session must be continued longer than would be convenient to prh. vate members. (Hear, hear.) Atpresentthere Twas at an earlier period than usnal an accumulation of ImportaLt measures, which it was essential to the public service to get through, so that the session might be ultimately closed at a convenient period. The right hon. gentleman thought thaSt the Government had had an ample allowance of the time o! the House, but the real fact was that the Government only had the whole of the Mondays and half of the Fridaysi whereas psrivate members bad the Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and half of the Fridays. This was a very unequal divislon; It was true that ho had opposed interference with that faculty which enabled private members to brlng forwad subjects of discussion on the motion of adjournment on Friday, but hemust say that that privilege had been rather largely u-sed of late. (" Hear," and laughter.) Nevertheles, the Government did not propose to abolsh that privilege5 but only asked that they might have another day when pubU4a measures of great Importance might be proceeded with. Considering that this was only a temporary arrangement,: he hoped the House would not think tho proposition unreas sonable. (Hear, hear.)
			Sir J. PAKINGTON said the noble lord had instanced the Reform Bills an exception to the fairconductof tho Oppo- sition; but surely a Bill of that importance was not to be. passed a second time without discussion,: and the delay Ii the progress of that Bill had from time to time been creatad and pramoted by the Government. (Hear, bear.) With regard to the Thursdays, the Govemment had had, in fact; the greater number of them already, and he therefore thought that the Government were prssing the House tca much when at so early a period they wanted to snonopollze all the Thursdays. (Hear, hear.) If the system -ot desultory conversations on the Frldays was to con. tinue, it ought, for the sake of the Government and of the transaction of publio busines, to be pla
			under some restriction. for nothing was more un- satisfactory than the way in which private members, under the mere pretest of the motion for adjournment, ononopo- Uszed half the Government evening writh discussons so iLl- conducted that it was almost impossible to understand what was talk-ed about. This was a mater which the Govern. ment should consider before they proposed to encroach oat
			zue r2gats or Independent members. (Hear, hear.) HLO trusted the Government would not press the presentmotion, but defer takmng the Thursdays until after Whitsuntide. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. BICH expre;ssed a hopo tht independent members wonld tand by their privilege, and not surreuder the Thurs- days before the usual time. He admitted that the Governm ment FrAday had been rather unscrpuplously eucroached upon, hut some p revision might be made for the mora regular conduct Of business on that evening.
			Mr. BENTINCK thought no case had been made out for the proposal of the noble lord. It had been admitted that. no unnecessary delay had been caused by the House in the dicussion of public measures. That proved that tho Go- vernment had miscalculated time, and had encambered themselves with more measures than they could' yossibly get through within a given period. (Hear, hear
			t was most unfair to pro ose an arrangement entirely nov;
			for the sake of relieving ths Government from a difnicnirT of their own creation. It had boon said that this wouldc U only a temporary arrangement, but, if adopted, it would at once pass into a most dangerous precedent. (Hear, hear.) The -whole tendency of the practice adopted by Governments on both sides of the House bad been for some years past to endeavour to stifle, and, if possible, nmnihilate thorIghis oE independent members. (Hecar, hear.) He hoped the Houm would not accede to this pro osal, and that private meo- bers, on the contrary, would be induced to compare the time now at their disposal with the time which used to be allotted to them some years since. Then gentlemen coull raise a debate on a petition as welU as upon alniost every auestion. That right had, however, been extinguished, and ft was matter for consideration whether Independent mom. bers should not now claim the restoration of their old privlleges. ("Hear," and a laugh.)
			Colonel FRENCH supported the proposal, on the ground that this was an exceptional session, owing to the extraor- dinary pressure of Government business, and that the adop- tion of such a proposal would tend to the convenience of members generally. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. DEEDES donbted very much whether the Govern- ment would'succeed in advancing their measures, even if the motion were agreed to. They would do much better to take the entire evening of Thursday, instead of the Friday evening, when there was so much interruption to Govern ment business. (Henr, hear.)
			Mr. CLAY thonght that under present circumstances, looldng to the exceptional amount of business before the Honse, the motion was a reasonable one; but it should be understood, if granted, that it was not to be converted into a procedent. (Cheers and laughter.)
			Lord STANLEY said, the hon. and gallant gentleman (Colonel French) had described this as an exceptional ses- slon. So in one sense it was, though not perhaps in the sense in which the hon. and gallat gentleman intended, becauso there had not for many years past been a sessioi
			in which so much time which should be at the disposal of independent members had been in practice appropriated b the Government. Thus, on Thursday the lst of March there was a discusslon on Customs' duties; on farch S the address In favour of the treaty wasmoved; on the 15th there was another debate and a division on the Custom&amp; dutier, and the Banlruptcy Bill was introduced; on Thursday the 22d there was a discussion on the Reform Bill, and orn the 29th one upon the income-tax and stamp duties. (Cheers.) There had absolutely not been one Thursday from the beginning of the session down to the present time of which a part at least had not been devoted to Govern. mont business. (Hear, hear.) The demand made bytho Government was an exceptional one, for which at this time of the year there was no precedent within his Parlia- mentary recollection. Nor was there any justification for such a demand in the state of business. Parliament had begun to sit considerably esrlier than usual; the Govern. ment-and he said it to their credit-had taken the earliest opportunity, of bringing on tho most important busness of tho year; snd their dnancial business was inn state of greater progress than usual at this time of year. On what ground, then, did this demand rest? General11, it was true, the civil service estimates had been presented before April; and It was not usual to have one set of army estimates sub. mitted, andthenv ithdravwn that others might be substituted in their place. (Hear, hear.) Buttherewas no good reaso5
			for acce ing to the motion, which, as had ben sdd, would be set upasaprecedent hereafter. Ifindependentmemrn, hers now surrendered their Thursdays, they vould not ba ikelytoget them atasii&amp;ar perIod another year. (Hear.). As to the discussions on the domrnent which tok place on Friday evenings, if the tight hen, gentleman (Mr-. Lou. verne) were again to submit hlis motion on this subjoct it would meet with a very different reception from that so. corded to it before. But hebseled it to be the general feeling on both sides of the House that such a demand as was now made could not reasonably be pressed 'pon the Honse. (Hear, hear.)
			Lord J. RUSSELL reminded the Honse of the cbang. which had tiken place of late years in tho conduct of budi
			nesg. According to the old cutom, the Government hardly ever brought in any measures. Theypzoposed their budgeo and their estimates at a certain timo; but there the duty of the Government ended, and members who wished to bring In measures on any subject did so. Of lateyears, however, as everybody knewv, theHouso had insisted that the Governmeab should take up any Important subject which happened to xe. quire legislation. He had tried in vain to resist the pressuror- but the House had always said in such cases, "' Thia is a qncstion for the Government, and it will be disgraceful in them If they do not deal with it.'
			In that way one subject after another was forced upon the Government, who were thus led to introduce many more measures than in former years. (Hear, bear.) While, therefore, the number of Government measures had. been largely increased by the compulsory pressure of the House, on the other hand there was less time at their dis. posaL As his noble friend had shown, oat of the fivo daya ono and a-half remained for tho Government and three and a-half for private members, and thus, with thre-fourths of the business to transact, Government was lefIt wih one. fourth of the time. (Hear, hear.) What was tho con. siquence? Take the Banauptcy Bill for Insane. That

			The CH1ANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER explained that one of the important objects which it was proposed by means of the rmeslation to effect was to provide a relf-c.ting regulator in the warehousing system. That system had re- ceived an extension which turned out to bo cosily to the wzithout any correspondiienUg 0advanutage abeeg thaet r

			large numb_ of districts idnthheintSerioreof the country had
			begun toconceivesa desire that warehousing privfieges should be extended to them. Manchester had obtained a conces- sion of that character, but subject to the conditionL that that city itself shonld in one form or another make good the necessaTy charge. It was, howvever, naturally asked upon behalf of the people of Manchester why they should, when they delivered hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of goods in the year, hb subject to such a charge, while in- significant places, because they happened to be port3, en- joyed warehousing privileges,, and had goods removed to them without contributing one farthing to the expenses of the 6txstomas' establishment. The result of the existing system, ho might add, had besn to spread and multiply warehouses, at the cost of the public. The Government were, ho thought, under those circumstancces justified In saling the House to submit to the proposal on the subject wvhich they had made. The healis of the present resolution, therefore, was that a. fce of a quarter per cent. should ho lov-ied generally on goode going into warehouse, buit not removed, there being an exception made in favour of tohacco, upon which the charcze should he one-eighth. The parties, he might add, upon whom the charge would In the firsb instance fall were not the importers of the
			oods, but the retail dealers throughout the country. qtwas1 not fair that the putblc should' hear the charge of these new wparehousing establishmoents. This wvas the ground upon which the second 5s. pe-r cent, upon removed goods was founded. The extension of thewarehousing system was very proper, hot tthe Crowu 4ought noDt to be called upDn to defray the whole expense of rnaintaining it in inlandl places, and a fair contribution ought3 to he paid thiere towards the cost. in tho case of sugar special regulations were proposed. That article gave little trouble to the Customs, officers, and entailed little outlay on the public. A charge of 5.s. only woutld therefore be made upon any quantity or sugar deliverable out of bond for refineries, the effecIt of this being to substitute, Instead of 5s. per cent., a charge almost inappreciably email. Tho prod'uce of the whole resolution would be about 50,0001.-a considerable reduction of revenue as compared with that which would hive acerued under the original proposition.

			Mr. AUGUSTUS SM H thought it had been ahown ihat the Government had already almost monopoltzed Thursdays forthelrownmeasures,%nd therefore he could not =eent to the propositiorn that was now made.
			Mr. PAULL, while desirous of alo,.ng every pzoper Opportunity for the carrying through of Government bsel- news, was not at all prepared to forego the privileges of in- dependent members.
			Slr a DOUGLAS sgpported the proposition of the Go- vernment, but hoped it would not be pressed against a large ;&gt;Jnority.
			Mr. WALPOLE remarked that the discussion had pro- Mddd upon two grounds that ought to be perfectly distinct. Oine wa a specizl ground, applcable to the present year only, and the other was a general ground, applicable to the cours of buosine in every session. As to the special ground, he did not think any cause had been shown for an faterference with the usual practice. (Hear, hear.) Ordi- !2arly the finandal eatement wan not made untU after Faster, and aU measures consequent upon that statement hd to be coneldered in the months of May and Juno. In fhe present year the financial statement had very properly been brought forward at an early period, and therefore, although apparently they were behid in their pDreOrss Sith supply and other business, yet they were, in fact
			much advanced in their financial arrangements. (Hear.;
			oe had, however, been struck by what had fallen from the noble lord the mpmber for London. He thought the time bid come when it would be well for those who guided the deliberations of the House on either side to consider whether any new arrangement could ba made for the transaction oi publlobusiness. (Hear, hear.) Unless the Government had
			a jener l acqniescence of the Housae I the present pro- positon, he thought It would rather delay than advance bussines. (Hear, hear.) He would suggest that the pre- sent motion should be withdrawn, and that the Govern- mentshould give notice that immediately after Baster they would propose an arrangement for the course of business on Tueedys and Thursdays and in referenoo to the proceed- Ings en Fridays. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. D. GRIFFITH was anxious that the Government should have their two days clear for the discussion of public Imsiness, bat without infringing on the rights of private imbers.
			Sir G. GREY agreed with the right hon. gentleman the snember for Cambridge that on a questlon of this kind it woild be uselem to press any motion against the general opinion of the House. He believed, however, there was a very general opinion that the practice which had grown up Df taking the greater pact of Friday ni,ght for the discission of generalquestions should be checked, or seie compensation
			iven to the Govemnment for the loss of time whichthey thereby sustained * and if he wasnot mistaken, there was a v-ry general feeling in ?avour of the motion proposed a few
			gveninga ago by the hon. member for St. Ives. He would take the liberty of proposing an addition to the motion of Lis noble friend (Lord Palmerston), which he hoped would be acceptable to the House. It was to add the wrords " and tht notices of motion have precedence of aU orders of the lay on Fridays.' (Hear, .) That proposal was, of
			uw, limited to thetimebetween Easter and Whiteontide -a the effect of it would be to make an experiment for that time of the motion proposed by the hon. member for St. Ive&amp; (Hear, hear.)
			fir. ESTCOURT hoped the riAht hon. gentleman was not going to ask the House to agree to a proposition of vrhieh no notice had been given. (Hear, hear.) He thought no proposition on thi subject should come from those vrho had an interest in It, bnt that they ehould have before them the zesults of the deliberate judgment of a select committee.
			Lord H. VXNE said the proposal before the House was not new, as it had already in effect been submitted to them by the hon. aenber for Sit. Ives, and he hoped it wonld be
			peed to. The Government had no reason to comnplain of tnueHonse this session, but there was certainlyv a general Impression that the Friday evenings were very much watd (Hear.)
			Mr. A. MILLS hoped the Government would accedo to the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman the member for Cambridge, and postpone the subject till after Easter.
			Mr. AYRTON also hoped the Government would post- pone the matter till after Easter. If there was to be no �Government business on Friday evenings the effect would be that the members would leave town, and the House ,would be counted out every Friday. (Hear.)
			MIr. DISRAELI asked if it was competenf to propose an amendment of this kind, which would change the standing orders without notice.
			The SPEAKER said that the amendment did not change the standing orders of the House. It only proposed a bchnge in the conduct of the business for five days between E2ster aud Whitsuntide, and it was not necessary to repeal the standing order for that limited object.
			Sir G. GREY.-Tbe words of the standing order were, 45unless the House should otherwise direct." Of course the addition he proposed would be a direction to the House.
			Mr. NEWDEGATE said It was the bplnion of the select eommittee which sat to consider the forms and procedure of the House, that even the suspension of a standing order ou,ght not to be made without notice. Ils righthon. friend (r. Henley) had on Saturday drawn attention to the fact thatseveral hon. members who were chairmen of Quarter Sessions wero at the present moment absent. Now, in the category of members who attended Quarter Sessions were many lhon. gentlemen who took a most useful part in the busliess of the House. Upon this ground alone he should snuport the suggestion of his right hon. friend (hIr. Wal- pole) that thin change in the standing order ought not to be made without notice. (Hear, hear.)
			ZMr. BOUVERIE could not consent to givo up both Thursday and Friday for Government business. But the chango proposed by his right hon. friend (Sir G. Grey) was i: the nature of an experiment during the interval between FAster and Whitsantide. If the experiment did not succeed the House could go baek to its orignmb practice. If, on the eter hand, the change was found to be an improvement Upon tho present practic, it it favoured the deSi atch of business-if, above all, business came on when mome an- dcipated It would be taken, It would then be easy to make a c rhange Nn the standing orders.

In ordereto make the inquiry clear he mest remind the touse that thero were two subjects before it which were of great importance end great interest to the House generally, but especah y to the great Liberal party-viz., the abolition of church-rates and the reform of the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) Ites happened that the discussion on church nites, which was upon the motion of a PrIvate mom- T1erp could not come on upon Thursday the 19th, as

			Lord 3.

The hon. gentleman probably knows that as soon as the Auistrian troops left Bologna thePapal authoritis3 left it likewise, and that as soon as the Grand Duke of Tus- cany left Florenes the grand ducal authoritlea left also. At Modena the same thing occurred. At Psrna the Grand Duchess showed more courage and determination, but still she was obliged to leave her dominions. These States havo resonved on awnexation with the kingdom of Sardinia.

			be charged with a duty of ... ... ... ... 1 6"
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said there was no necesaity to trouble the committee with any length- ened details, but merely to explain the relation in which this resolution stood to the original resolation Nao. 11. At tbat time It was proposed to make a charge of Id. upon aU articles of Import and export alike, with cer- tain adijutments, so as to keep within a certain proportion of the valus of the goods. It was also proposed to levy charges on articles removed in bond and on operations in warehouses. The total proceeds were calculated at 420,000l.-viz., 300,0001. from the penny charge; 60,0001. from the charge on goods removed; and 60,0001. from the charge on operations in warehouses. But there were various points, particslarly in respect to the charges on goods removed and on operations in warehouses which were reoeived with a great deal of doubt, distrust, and even disapproval by the mercantile classes immediately affected by them; and be was bound to say that, as origin- ally framed, they would probably have tended to restrict the applscation of the warehousing system, which was so highly beneficial to the country. There was some difficulty in the application of the penny registration to the trade, parti- cularly the export trade, which forrevenue purposes was not socasilymanaged as the import trade. Theexport trade had entaUledthe principal sacrifice which he was about to make. At one time he was disposed to get rid of the adjustment of the penny rate, by reverting to a charge ad va7oremaof 2s. 6d. per cent., and that charge, while it might have been levied in a simple manner, would probably have enabled them to attain much greater securacy in the gtatistles of exporbt than at present. But objections were made that a charge on value would offer perpetual occasion for petty frauds. It must not be supposed that great mercantile houses would deliberately and systematically undervalue goods for the

			was a general expectation of fraud ahe felt bound to maker an alteration whiech would obviate the necessity of causing considerable disturbance in the course of trade, throuigh having to provide effectual sasurities in all esses against fraud. Tho usage at present was for three bills of lading to be drawn and given to the parties concerned. These were countersigned by the different persons who were responsible, and they wvere liable to bear a stamp of 6d. each. The pro- posa,l had been that In all cases a fourth bill of lading should bgiven similarly countersigned, and certifying to contain aon rate accouut of the goods. That woad b ave sup- plied from 100,0004 to 120,0001. to the Exchequer. Taking however, theobill of lading as they now proposed to do, witx the stamp of Is. lid., they did not estimate that it would yield more than 60,0001. As the plau wa originally sog- gested to Parliament he should have expected to raise a
			considerably greater s'u mthan that fromn the penny charge. on experts. They had reckoned on obtaining nearly 300,spc1. As the plan now stood it would produce on im- ports about 170,0001., and on the stamp on bills of lading outwards 60,0001., making together 230,0001. ; thus invorving a sacrifice of some 70 0001. The other reso- lutions would yield considerably 'less, even if they stood as they now did, than under the original estimate. The second resolution related to goods removed under bond, and would prodtice somewhat less than it would have done under its original form. The estimate at first stood at between 50,0001. and 60,0001.; now it was about 50,0001. The third resolution dealt with charges on operations in warehouse. 'Che rate on these operations bad been so much reduced that instead of producing from 60,0001. to 70,0001., the resolution in its p resent shape would produce only 30,0001. There was stil an indisposition en the part of many gentlemen connceted with the trade to see this prin- cipleolf charge for operations inwarohousoadopted. (Hear, her.) They did not dtsptLe its justice but its policy in re- spect to the convenience of commerce. He was not prepared to abandon the resolution, but as these who were opposed to it were stil engaged in considering what substitute less open to objection the could suggest, he was quite willing to let thequestiuon standovertillaftertheEsster recesm.

			Mr. N~EWDEGATE wvas afraid theo right hen, gentle- man's system would not lead to Increased accuracy In our Customs' statistic3. Having himself made laborious re- searches in this matter, he had generally discovered that the declared value was very considerably in excess of the real value of the goods. Dld the right hen, gentleman intend to adopt any means of seccuring accuracy in the declared value?-
			The CHA-NCELLOR of the EXCHIEQUER believed that the values had often been very carelessly stated, buLt it was a mistake to senppose that thaey had been system atically exag- gerated. With respect to imports, it was not necessary to adopt anow rule. As to exports, at preent the values were delivered to the Customs by the junior clerks of mercantile es,tablishmnents, and were not tested by any responsible parties. 'Under the bill of ladieg, on the contrary, they would he so tested, and brought under the vlew of the Customs.
			M1r. LINDSAY doubted very much whether the Chan- cellor of the Exchequer would obtain all he expected from these propositions. The great number of small parcels which were now sent as "broken stowage" would for the futurce be made up in lar-ge packages; an instead of being charged half freight, they would be charge3 fnul freight; so that ulti- mately the tax would fall on the consu~mer.' In many cases the expenses of collection would be greater than the revenue obtained. With respect to the Is. 6d. on bills of lading, It was most unfair to put the same charge on all bills of lading alike, whether they were for 5s. or 10,0001.
			Mr. T. BARING alowed that these amended resolutions were preferable to those orignly proposed by the Chan- colloroftheExcbequer,butth .g,r-ave objection still remained that ho was introducing fresh complications into the mode of carrying on trade, and subjecting traders t-o petty, vexatious payments which ought nerer to have formed part of a comprehensive scheme of finance (Hear, bear.) The system on which the sight hen, gentlemanx was entering was moss ruinous; if England was to be the emporium of foreign, trade, the imposition of such charges as these must ho most damaging. Competition wvas already smart enough, and the moment when a heavy income-tax was being put on Schedule D, which included traders, was most Inopportane for in- venting a new tax of this character.

			Mr. CRAWFORID said that, although he did not entirely approvo the mode In which the'Chancellor of tbe Ex- chequer proposed to obtatn an rccesslon of revenue in the room of tha taxes which ho was giving up, he thought that the charges now under discsasion would be collected with less Inconvenience, and would produce a larger revenue than many hon. members seemed to suppose.
			Sir E. CAIRNS hoped that the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer would take precautions against goods exported from Ireland to a foreign country, or Imported from such a country into Ireland through anEnglish port,bhengsubtected to double charges under these resolutions. (Hear, bear.) He also suggested that measures should ho adopted, by re- quiring a declaration of the origin or place of manufacture of the goods in the bill of lading, to show what pc:tion of the goods exported from English ports had originally come from Ireland. At present no such means were adopted, and In the general statistical returns Ireland appeared to export only a few hundred thousand pounds worth of goods, whilo she realy exported to the value of millions. The resolution, as it stoo7appeared to give the Treary rather too much power in fixig these charges, and he thought it would bo desirable to Insert, either here or in the Customs Act, words limiting their authorlty in that respect to the amount fixed by these resolutions. He had no doubt that this tax on Bills of ladlng would be agreed to, but it was open to two se-ious objections. One was the inequality of its incidence; the other, that it was not justifed by the motives assigned for Its imposition.
			Mr. HANKEY wanted to know what thls tax was a sub- titutte for. The commercial community of London had re- commended a tax on biLls of lading, both inward and out- ward, in lieu of an obnoxious impost on packages, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer wished to have both. Hle had no obe tiont himself to a tax on hbills of lading, but, before age nto It, he should like to have an assuirancee that no attempt would be made to levy an Impost upon packages.
			Mr. CAVE said It might be questloned whether the cost of collecting trading statistics for the benefit of the vrwole commtunity ought to be saddled upon the commercial ckasses. at present, however, it actually fell uponthose classes, because the servants of the dock companies collected the inornmation at the expense of the importers, and the Com-hros Tolagncts,too nit tolsecond b hand without frther inquiry To excaygn hi tlaxn bo his,o hadin fore the same pf a pose would he to tmitate the conduet of the Rusiand ofticers

The Chan- celor oEf the Exchequer, Tin aCCpting the proposition of the London merchants, who had told him how to tax themselves, aad in exchanging his plan for theirs, had acted the part of a highwvayman who should strip a traveller to the skin and then give bini his on shirt and trousers to run away with.

Though the charge looked small on paper, and though it was, indeed, so sonall that the importing merchant would not be able to charge It to his customers, yet in many cases it would amount to a charge on thLei mportinlgmerchant equa to from 25 to 50 per cent, of th incme-txh. ol aet a in the current year to the Government.
			Mr. HORSTALL accepted the first resolution of the Cbancelor of the Exchequer asa conpromise, hut he should have been well pleased if he had stated that he abandoned oharges on operatlons in bond altogether. That part of the scheme would be found most difficult to be carried into effect.
			MrOHILDERS understood that, under the reslution, it was estimated that 230,0001. would be obtained, and the resolution affirmed that the meney was rd.sod in alid of the charges of Castoms' establishments incident to the conduct of trade and to the statistical acconunts thereof. Hoe, how- ever, maintained that 50,OO0l .would bea areasonable amount to put down on that account. He took it that the great mass of the expense in the Customa' establishment was caused by the collection of the duties on duty- charged goods, the operations with respect to free goods being exceedingly simple. He wished, then to know whe- ther these charges or fees were to be treated as duties on duty-charged goods, or whether some other mode of dealing with them would be devised. In the latter case the objec- tion he had statedl would fall to the ground. He thought he could suggest a substitute not obnoxious to the objections to which the proposed charge was liable, and yet capable of ralsing the required revenue. As a substitute he would propose a uniform Id. stamnp on all entries, papeLrs, and documents passed at the Custom-houise, which would be easily collected, and from whioh an amount of revenue would to derived at least equal to the establish- ment charge incurred. With respect to the second part of the resolation, which Imposed Is. 6d. on everv bill of lading, it was to he rogollected that already bhills of Iding were ub'- ject to a charge of Gd. each; hut that charge migh~t he accepted as the means of collecting more satisfactory statis- ties than could at present he obtained.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXOEBQUJER thought it scarcely fair to say that he had adopted bills of lading and given up nothing in return. What he took was calculated to produce not more than 60,0001., whereas what he had surrendere was equivalent to 150,0001. ; and he had to make up the difference. Thehon, gentleman the member for Ponte. fract seemed to think that the stamp duty of Id. under this resolution was Imposed in respech merely of the statistical department ; the charge was of a more general character incident to the conduct of tnde. A great deal of direct ser- vice was dlone by the Customs, and recognized by the mer- chants themselves as the best vouchers they could have. The hon, gentleman proposed as a substitute the charge of ld. upon every entry and paper of whatever descrip-ion pacsse by the austoma affecting commerce rod trade. Now

			MIr. CEILDERS Inquired whether these charges would pass through the Cnstoms' books in the same way as the ordinary duties.
			Mr. CRAWFORD could see no difficulty in keeping a separate accounat of all charges " incident to the conduct of trade, and to the statistical accounts thereof."
			The CHANTCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said a sepa- rate account would be kept of all these charges, and the full est means given to ascertain what was their produce, with a view to any proposal that might afterwards he made respecting them. As regards the collection of them, that would be conducted as far as possible by stamps prepared for the purpose, and which, no doubt, would be very extensively used for the convenience of 'Parties. His right hon. friend at the head of the Customns assured him that. the whole operation would be a matter of the
			eatestesonlicit and would not interfere with the or- neive reduction of the establishment which he promised.
			Mr. AYRTON urged the right hon. gentleman to recon- sider this clause.
			theirr own refrehmentis would haive to take out a licence and be suibjected to the supervision of the Paice. Clause 12 of the Bill gave moDst extraordi:nary powers to mnagistrates.

Now, it was notorious thatmayothpulc houses in this country had fallen ntotehnsfte brewers (hear, bear) although they had no return shuowing to what extent that had takeon place. When, however, b
			someo great catastrophe,the veil was withdrawn the publio got
			n peep behind the scenes, and saw how the brewers were
			modup with th icenlsing sytem. In the case of Cal- vesri's bankcruptcy it was found t-hat outt of 750,0001. invested in the busitiess the sum of 468,00D1. was tnot invested In the proper business of brewing, hut In public. house property,-that was to say, either In buying
			ppubliohonses, or in lending money to publicans, over whom they thereby obtained the gteatest influence. The plublicanL derived a very small profit from the ezale of beer, and loo,ed to the saleoof spirits for his compensation. Th-at could hardly be called a system proemotive of temperance. No connexion like that between the brewer and the publican. existed Vetween the wholesale grocer and the retail grocer, by which the latter was compelled to take all his too and
			sgar fro the former. If such a connexon were really to ho establishd, the retail grocer would not he able to serve his customers so well, and he would soon find a rival chop
			oeig, and taking aLway al his trade. The licensing syte, however, deprivedl the public of this -whole- some check- of competit4on in regard to liquor. If a great brewer bought up SO publichouses in a particular locality he knew that the maplIatrates wvould not license 50 more, andhbetherefore felt himself quite safe. He was sure of his investmnent, and know that the hoases would remain to take his beer to any extent. The brewers, doubtlms, cent out perfectly good Toosr to the publicans and the latter were tempted, by the low price at whichs they had to retail it, "to pump the Newi River into it." (A- laugh.) That fact ad ben established before the select committe. To give it afictitious strength they sometimes, but not to any very greatextent, added some noxiouis drugs. The Beer Billhadanot be-n ve-rysuccessful. Thebheereeller neverhbad afair chance. Having to compete with the li- censedavictualler, who made his great profit on spirits, he had to resort to all sorts of shifts for a living. The first thing which such a person did was to make an effort to rise in the world by becoming a lioensed victuauer. But though nothing could be said against his character, though therew was no ground for complaint in the manmer in which he had conduacted his shop, or in the accommodation which be afrorded to the public-frequently at great expense to the public, his application was almost invariably refused at the instigation of counsel on behalf of the licensed vic. tutallers, onx the ground that there were already sufficient houses in the neighbouirhood. No argaments, therefore, ought to be drawn from the esse of the beershop keeper in illustration of the probable result of an extension of the licensing system. He believed that the hour to which these houses shouldl he allowed to remain open was a matter re- quiring consideratison.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCIHEQTJER.-We pro- pose to assimilate this hours preciely to those of the beer. shops.
			Mr. K. SBYMrER sadc this was the very point he was anxious to come to, but he would even go further, and say t'hat In large towns, containing a, population exceeding 50,000, beershop keepers who had obtasned wine licenses should be allowed to sell beer equally with wine as late as 12 o'clock at night ; because if the two things were kept separate, and the shop was allowed to remain open for the sale orfwine but not for that of beer, the temptation to sell the prohibitedi article wrould be co strong that the rule woulda certainly be infringed (hear, boor), and the House had no rlght to place maen in such a pesttion. He now came to the case of the real and powerfulopl~nouts of the Bill. The Chancellor of the Ex- chequer, he believed,haddone thewise-st thin"in his power in laying on tho table the memorial of thE' licensedt vie. tailers, wFhich e6uld not be too widely circulated, It commnenced by stating that it was proposed to) give to every person applying for a license the powver of selling for con- sumption on the premises. This vms not true ; a license would by no moons he granted unless the applicant had complied w~ith certain requisites. The house for wvhich licene was sought must be bond jfric rated at 201.

			those who were anxious to promote temperance were need- lesly alarmed at this measure, and tha.t the oppositionk of the licensed vietnailers to it was purely a selfish opposition. He, th erefore, hoped that Parliamenxt would sancotion the Bill of his right hen, friend. (Hear, hear.)
			aZr. lmnj I seas rnas tno conrse of argument vwhch had been adopted byhis hon. friend the member for Dorsetshiro did net touch the real quescion before the Homse, which was whether it was necessary or advisable to increaso the facili- ties for seiling intoxicating liquors, and whether the course which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had adopted in framing this Bill was calculated to advance the interests of the revenue without injury to the public morals or inter- ference with social crder. (Hear, hear.) WVithont havin,
			any special interest in the prosperity of any brewerhe might say that he did not believe in the truth of the cry which had been ralsed against them. They sent a good article to the publichouses and beershops, and he ventured to say that If a free competition were established to-morrow that capital would carry the day in this as in all other businesses and would place the great brewers at the head of the trade. Ag to the vested interests of the publicans, he not think that they would suffer to the amount of 50,000,0001., or, in- deed, be seriously affected by this Bill. What mlght come afterwards was another question. He was not calUed upon, nor, indeed, was he prepared to defend every part of tho present licensing system. lIe admitted that there were many things connected with that system which milght ba improved. In his opinion it was just and right that thoso who had charge of order in the country, the justices of tho peace, should, as far as possible, hava fual control over places in which numbers of people assembled, and where by. the consumptionof intoxicating liquors they wego led Into the commission of offenses (hear, hear), and it was de. sirable that the magistrates should have the initlative as to pronouncing upcn the fitneon of the persons by whom, and the places w ore, such liquors might be publicly con- snmed (hear, hear); bnt he was not aatisfied with the ap- appeal which at present existod in the matter of licenses. In most parts of the country it bad become a mere matter of form, because the quarter sessions never interfered with tho declsion of the petty sessions. In such cases it would be, better that there should be no appe1l, and that the respon- siblity should rest with the magistrates who really decided the case. In other instances however, benches of magis- trates atquatter cessiona sctee-.npcntheprinclple of alowng free trade, and granted licenses without any reference to the decision of the justices below. That was an eonally ob- jectionable conrsce; and it vwas most desirable t6at souse plan should ho rdevised which wrould give satisfaction to the public, and woula, at the same time, check tho uadue increase of drinking houses and their establishment innnfitsituatlon9. (Hear.) HIsintention hadbeennotto oppose the second reading of the Bill, but to endeavour im com- mittee to induce the Chancelor of the Exchequer, who had already expressed himself favourable to many alterations, to go further is that direction. As, howvcer an hon. member had moved the rejection of the Bill, he should sup- port that motion. He did not agree with the United King. dom Alliance, as to the propriety of proscribing, even by a permissive Bill, tho mxe of liquors, merely becasa their abuse was dangerons. any more than ho should be prepared to prohibit tho practice of allopathic doctora, and the universal establishment of a system of hommopathy or hydropathy. A. laugh.) As to the pri- mary object of the Chancellor o the Exchbenor, the raislng of revenue, he was disposed to agree with the hon. and learned member for Southampton, that this mem- sure would be a failure - and that, as far as thD importation of the light l'rench wines wae concerned, no large sum would accrno to the public Treasury. He was bound to ssuame that the Chancellor of the Exche- onuer's estimate as to revenue would be realized, and that thero would be a larec consumption o!; hese wine. Theo present consumption oE entoxicating liquors, including al kinds, was 684,000,000 gallons peru onum, and comparing the number of the population w ith the qutantity of liquors already consumed, ho could ndt thlngk that any tn- crcase could be made with a1vantagher, (Eear, hear.) It was said that free trade in drink should bo en- couraged-with reference, of course, to the revenue-in order to get rid of the existing restrictive system, to intro- duce competition, and to put dowin adulteration. Thoso who said so seemed to suppo.se that nothing had ever been tried before. WVhy, up to 1498 there was perfect freedomn of vrade with sespect to sie, and the first power given to justices was something liko the negativo power which tho Chancellor of the Exceoquae now pro- posed to place In their hands. It proved a completo failure, andin the reign of James I.-that happyperlod, to which we had been referred, when French vwines were largely consumed in this country-furtherrestr!ctive measores were adopted in order to put a stopto the "odion3 and loathsome sin of drunkenness, the source of every crime," wbich then prevailed. Those measures, however, wera ineffectual, for Defoe said that drunkenness was introdnced again at the Restoration, and for 40 years continued without diminution. Yet, in the rilgn of Charles IL, the'people of England foDowed the French habit of drlnkdng light wines. At one time claret was largely consumed in Sootland. A jna of it was sold for 6d. In the streets Of Lelth, and we All k-now to what an extent drunkenness prevailed in Scotland at that perIod. In the relgn of George IL there was a great deal of legislation with respece to gin, which was then a comparatively new liquor. One Act after another was passed with the view of stopping its sale, but in vain. An enormous duty ws put uponthe article, but tho spirit and wino sellers supplied it at a low price nuder b. variety of pleasant names, denoting cordial and sooOthing qualities. For two years lIcenses wsere alto"&gt;ethor refused in the city of London. Then camein the licensing system, properly so called, which fr.sted up to 'he passing of the lceer
			Act, introduced for the purpose of removing restrlc- lons on the sale of beer. The Beer Act was recommended on the ground that It would provide the people with cheap and ready accommodation and a more wholesoma beverage, and that it would lead to the establishment of house of a better order. Never had s prophecy been so falsified. Tho boerhCuses were one of the greatest curses which England ever endoed (Hear.) Someyearsago,whenhebadchargeof
			Beer Bill, a brewer who supplied beershopa told him In a letter that the whole system was rotten, atrocious, nd do- llorallnrg and that be hoped hbe ould do nothing whlch might hva the effect of perpetuating I. Moreover, it had been stated before a select committee of that House that the beerahop system had proved an entire failure, and thatthe mere multiplication of drinidng houses, withontreference to what they did or sold, was In itself an evil of the first mag- nitude. The hon. member for Dor3et was a member of thLt committee, and he signed its report, and yet he was nowv calng on the House to increase the number of thes3 drink. lag places under a new name. (Hear hear.) It was pro- posed to give wine licenses to beershops. (" eo.") Why, the Act which prohibited beershops from sell- ing wine was repealed by the present Bill, and if, therefore, a beershop should become an eating-honse, from that moment the keeper would be enabled to go to the Excise and, subject to the conditions mentioned in the Bill, to take out a wine In addition to his beer license. (Hear, bear.) But it seemed that the chief thinig wanted ws com- petitlon. At present, in spite of a monopoly, so attrac- tive was this trade, so growing the habit which It upplied, that there were about 121,336 of these hbouae. In 1856 their proportion to the whole population wa as I to 176 to the males of all ages as 1 to 87. In 1841 thye ttotAemalesover20years of ace asl to 42; to mesand femalesas I to 88. But in 1g58they had so Increased that they were to the males over 20 years of age au to 38; to males and females as 1 to 80, He thought be had good ground for asldng the House to pause before they increased the number of houses which sup-
			lied intoxicating liquors to the people. (Hear, hear.) The Chancelor of the Exchequer said that the magis- trates bad an impossible duty to perform, the Legis- lature making them judges of the quantity of Hquor to be consumed. That argument was unworthy of the ingenuity and lcgical mind of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. On what principle could it be said, if the number of houses for the sapply of drink was aa one hoeseto 80 persons, that there was any difficulty in procuring any quantity of liquor? (Hear1 bear.) If it was meant to be said that by dlmnisahing the number of drinkin -houses the quantity of lquor consumed was dim.ilhed,he would agree In the proposition, for he thoughtthat the multiplica- ton of these houses was an evil, and a temptation to the drunken man. (Hfear.) In everyinstancewbvere drunken people weresubjectto a crmtinal chargeit was not because they drank at one beerobop, hut, having staggered at an early hour from one beershop, they meet with S50 other tempts- slons of the same kind on their way home and it was when they left the last, in a state of hopeless drunkenness, that the offence was committed. Whenever it was found in re- spect to any of these houses that there was a. per- petual disobeditence of the law, the Hicences ought to be siwept awy, waithout regard to the proprieter. It then Hecame a question of public order, and public order ought to be supported. (lear, hear.) The hon. member for Dorsetshire stated t at he had observed drinklng houses open at every hour, and after that statement could any man contend that either in this great metropols, or in any town In the country, there was no' an ample 1supply of pubUc- houses? The hon. member was ood of free trade, but would he carry out his principles so far as to allow every tenant on his property to have a licence ? There wa not a proprietor of land who did not stipulate that beuorhops and poblichousee should no' be opened on his property without his consent; and therefore let them not legislate in that House on false protencea, hut, with the honest feeling which actuated them In their own private capacity,when checking drcnken-
			in their villaes, check it in like manner thzoughout the, country. (Hear.) But this system of free trade was to cause the sale of wine, and this was said in the face of the report of the committee of 1854, from which It appeared, on the evidence of Sir R. Mayne, that 5he free vintners who had the free sale of wine In this city, instead of selling the pure unadulterated Hquor sold spirits under the cover of wooe. If the present BilL should pass into law what security would there be that the same thing would not be done in the beershops ? And, in- deed, if aDowed to sell wine, why should those shops not be allowed to sell spirits under the system of free t'rade? The Bill was founded on a principle that went further than the Bl Iteeslf; it pat in the thin end of the wedge, which the hon. member for Do3setshire was anxious to dlver 'home, and opened the deer for free trade in articles to which the principle Of free trade ought never to be applied. (Hear,hear.) It was said that eating and drinkn, now separated, would be combined under the operaion of tihe present Bill, but it It struck him that mere was drank fter dinner than at dinner. (" No !") At least that used to be the case. HRe wished to knowv for whom these eating-houses wereintended. He found that in 40 towns in Scotand every 149 persons supported a dram shop, while It took 981 to keep a baker, 1,061 a butcher, and 2,231 a bookseller. How could they be sure, when people went to an eating- house, that they went there to eat! It should be borne in mind that there were many causes provocative of drink- Ing:-
			"Good wine, a friend, or being dry, "Or lest you might be by and by, "Or any other reason why."
			A lsrge number of persons must go to these eating-honses to drink, If an Increase of revenue was to take place under the Bill11; and when a man once passed the proper boundary and ceased to be master of himself, he did not care ho v much he drank, and cared little for eating. (Hear.) The owner of an eating-house, too, if he fond more profit In selling drink than in cenin food, would be sure to encourage drinkins, and the result would be that these h2ouses would scarcely be eating-houses at all. Heonow came to the question-did free trade apply to this subject? It was admitted that with respect to the homses li- coused under the Bill stringent regulations would be required, and that the police must have free access to them. Were these things conslstent with tree trade? Was the object of the report of the committee, overwhichthePresident of the PoorlawBoardpresded,free trade? Free trade favoured the development of trade, but the p rpose of all these regulations was the restriction of trade.
			he object of that committee was to get rid of a great nuns- ber of the publlchouses. But, further than that, the right hion. the Chancellor of the Exchequer the other night referred to the case of Ldverpool and Manchester as illus- trating his doctrine. A relative of the right hon. gen- tleman, a magistrate of Liverpool, took it into his head that free trade was a good thing in the matter of putbli- house licenses; by a majority of one the magistrates carried a resolution to that effect. What was the conseqdence? In every Instance applicants got lienses, and soon there were 1,520 publlchouses in LiverpooL. At the same time Mancheste, with as large a population, hadl only 450. Ac- cording to the doctrine oi the right enon gentleman, the efrect of this should have been to bring things to their natural level and to cheek drunkenness. But the fact was that every of these hoases was reduced to an insane competi- tion. Mr. Robertson Gladstone stated in his evidence that the parties who kept them were going through the Bank- ruptcy Court, and -yet crowds were pressing Into the trade.
			iear, hear.) The effect of this state of things vas thas ndicated:
			" From the returns furnished to the comuittee it was proved that the avenage number of committals for drunken- mess in eight ef the largest towns in England under the operation of the licensing system was 1 In 3t3; while Liver- uo,sthe theatre of the experiment of the system recon- mendedmby tera committeerfor univeral andoption,was 1 in 20, or about 20etimes the amfect oun ofre drun s ithat exists

			amuchon level as they d been for many years bore. It hwa not for him to say whether they had not carried restriction too far; but the consequence wa the very evll they deplored, that, in consequence of the Excise lIcenses, 1,400 or 1,500 beershops sprang, up in that city. Some yeas ago there was comparatively free trade in Dablin, and in the year 1841 there were taken before the
			oagiatrates 24,443 persons, of whom there were no less than 23,414 afrected by drink. So much, then, for the question of free trade. Was there any call for this Bill on the part of the public? On the contrary, he ventured to affim that there was a strong opinion agahat It. The magistrates of the West Riding of York-shire had been inL communication with the Chanceilor of the Exchequer on this subject, and ho believed seine of their amendments hakd been embodied in the Bill. But the riaht hon. gentlemnan said he was about to remedy all the eAils of the system by imposng n esrictons.And ow hecame to the im- porantqustin, oud tey as ths Bllwithout injuring socil oderandpubic oraity (Har,hear.) By the

If a person carried on the business of a confectioner, he was to he entitled to a license.) WVhat, then, was the trade of a confectioner? Talk of having a glasu of light wine with a biscuit for lunch ! Hon. gentlemen were constantly in the habit of resorting to the counter in the lobby of that house; hat who over asked for a glass of claret? Yet if ever a rlace existed where it was needed it wras there. Breat.) The high-class confectioner would have sherry on the counter ; but what of the low-class confectioner? What was to constitute the low-class confectiouer? Hf a per- son put a few biseults, or cakes, or confections in his window, was that to entitle him to a license ? If not, what consti- tutedsaconfectioner? The Chancellor of theExchequer did not put thocharacter of theappllcantluquestion; he refused1 to allow the fitnessof the premLsestobecoosidered - nochecik vwa provided as to the nature of the house Itself ; hut he gave a vast and irresponsible power to the magistrates. At pressan; the power which the magistrates possessed was only odfous to those who had their licenses ref used ; but the power of magistrates under this Bill would render them odious to the whole mass of, En&amp;lishmen because it was an ireronIbl,e power. The Bill aYsplaced enormous power In th ads of thepolice, Thewholeadministrationwasplaced in the hands of the superintendent of police, acting In per-
			rated as a check on magatrates, Bat there would be no such check under this BIlL At present every magistrate acted freely and honestly because openly but by the irre. sponsible veto given them under this BI they would lead the magistracy into temptation, and make their powers so odious as to lead In a few years tothe zweeping away of the entirellcenslng system. He adkased early in the resgon when the report of the commisson to inquie into the Forbes Mackenzie Act In Scotland would be produced. He did not know what these gentlemen would report but they were gentlemen of considerable eminence and ali ty, and of high character. Sir G. Clerk's name would at once carry weight w{th it, nd was it not important that before proceeding to legislte the House ahould know what the report of the commissloners was? (Hear hear.) The rght hon. gentleman said the adulteration .ould be chocked by this messuro. Brut the House was dis- cosing only a fev7 days since a BMl to prevent the adulteration of food and drink; and in the gtatutes re- lating to publicans and beerhonses there were strngent enactments to check thig practice. Oar bread, we were told, w=a nearly a3l plastez-of-Parls, and our cayenne was brickdatt; so that when a man became dyspeptUo by eat- ing the one, and took a little of the other to stimulate his diges3ton he was in danger of having his Etomach en- tirely wahed.up. (Laughter. Under the most perfect system of free trade, therefore, adulteration Etill prevailed, and did the right hor. gentleman seriously hope to put a stop to it by this new piece of legislation ? Again, with re- ard to refreshment-houses, did he reaUy man to give these ceuca 2at random toplaces of this clan? The permisslon to sell wine in single bottles wa a matter of minor im- portance; but it was noteworthy that in Scotland a source of considerable evil was the presenting of drams to servants oTer the counter; and was it so certain here that Instead of those vails which were now given to servants at Christmias shopkeepers wonld not at a chesper rate supply them with intoxicatiD iquors? Besides the soeia aspect of this ques- tion, the neuee must ask itself whether the Bill would suc- ceed in benefitting the revenue. He thought not. In thil
			country it was tolerably evident which way the taste for IInor tended, and It was not by Introducing a milder sUmnlant tha t you would take away the taste for a stronger one. T'he right. hon. gentleman sid that in countries where light wmES were consumed drunkenness did not pre- vail. UJpon this poit he (Mr. Elardy) had not been able to obtain distinct informaMon, but Penaimore Cooper, the American novelist, declared that in Paris he saw more drunken people by going into the right quarters than ever he saw in London. There were no fewer than 360,000 of these wineshops in France, and It was zascertained also that out of 1,100 homicides 400 were committed in these places. With respect toSweden the Chancellor of theExchequerhad given some information which he was glad to hear. Some time ago he had occasion to comment upon the ease of Sweden, and he should be delighted to hear that she had rescued herself from the reproach to which she then seemed open. In Sweden there vws an unlimited rlght to distil, enjoyed by every peasant; and in Alison's Historyi it was stated that under that system, notwithstanding the thinness of the population, there wete 150,000 distlerieas, the consequence being a degree of immorality in some of the towns unparaUeled In any European capital. In the conscriptlon of 1852 for a disrct of Western Russia, out of 174 young men examined for the army only four were declared admissible by the surgeons, the remaining 170 being physicmlly incapacitated by dram-drinking. In the face of such facts as these he could not accept for Gospel the general assertion that wine-drinking countries were in any degree free 'rom the evils which in this country arose from drunkenness. (Hear, hear.) e weas happy t, observe here a gradual decrease in the consumption of liquors, which was due partly to the efforts of temperance societes, to the Improved education and increased facilities for Information and amusement possessed by the masses, and, more than all, to the better houses which had been, and which he trusted were being built, In various parts of the country for the labotrng cbasses. (Hear, hear.) This want was at theroot of many eVils for if men had comfortable homes they would not seeo in the sanded rooms of beerhouses en- joyments which they did not find under their own roofs. The right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the BE- chequer, however, anticipated a conslderable revenue from the operation of the present Bll; but was it not, he would ask, the fact that a steady decrease in the cosnmsmption of spirituous liquors had taken place of late years in proportion as the consumption of tea, coffee, and cocoa became more widely spread? Was theHose prepared to putastop tosuchastateof things? Did bon. members seek to supply the place of the articles which he had just mentioned by the introduction of wine ? If so, did they expect that the light wines of France were to sort he Maple prodnuts of oorsumption? Was it the fact thA the taa*6 foreuch wines would be found to exist, except among pbe higher olasees? (Hear, her.) It was well knotpat a large qsn of wine was imported into France from Spain, which admited of being mixed With acool to a great eatent to suit the English market, so tht if 3t were introduoed into this country we shoul only have is1iitln n anothorsha (Hear hear.) The right on. gentleman the Chancellr of the kEcheqter sought to make the year 1860 prominent year, snd to mask It as the epoch of a great fiscal revolution. He said to himself, in the spirit of Jaok Cade, that the conduits should ran nothing but claret I the first year of bls reign; but he would warn the right hon. gentleman, iU he wished to place his fame on a per- manent footing, to build it upon some better foundation than that of the establLshment throughout the country of houses for facilitating the increase of the consumption of intoxicating liquors. (Cheers.)
			Mr. AYRTON moved the adjournment of the debate.
			The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, that whlleheregrettedthatowing, tothesiate of pubHc business, It had not been found convenient to bring the dissussion to a close that evening, he should not, as several hon. gentle- men seemed to wish to take part in the debate, object to its adjournment until the 19th of ApriL (Hear, hear.)

			-ZONDON, TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 1.
			In the House of Lords last night,
			The Stamp Duties BiU and the Income-tax Bill were both read a third time and passed, it being understood that a discussion upon the financial measures of the Government should take place after Easter.
			The Lordships adjourned at five minutes to 6 o'clock.
			En the House of Commons,
			Lord J. RussErL, in laying upon the table papers relating to the Savoy question, gave a short exposi- tion of their contents.
			On the motion of Lord J. RUSSELL, that upon Thursdays after Easter, and till Whitsuntide, Go- vernment orders of the day have precedence of notices of motions,
			Colonel W. PATrS observed that it was rather early in the session for such a proposal, which would be a restraint upon private members, though he acknowledged that the curtailment of the time at the command of the Government on Fridays by the debates raised on the motion for adjournment caUed for some regulation for the better conduct of the public business.
			The motion was opposed by several members, In- cluding Mr. DisaAELT, Sir J. PAKINGTO.S, Lord STANLEY, and Mr. WALPOLE, who, however, thought the time had come for considering some new mode by which the public business could be better arranged.
			Sir G. GREY moved, as an amendment, to add to the motion the words, " and that notices of motion have precedence of orders on Fridays."
			After a rather protracted discussion, the House divided upon this amendment, which was carried by 150 to 126.
			Some further discussion ensued, and the House again divided upon the original motion as amended, which was carried by 142 to 117.
			In reply to Mr. HaNENasy,
			Lord J. RussnEL said HEE ArATsTY had been advised to recognize the recent acquisitions of the King of SARDINIA as forming part of his dominions.
			The House then went into Committee upon the Customs Acts, when
			Tho C.cNCExuol of the ExCHEQUER moved certain further amended resolutions, explaining their nature and effect, and the reasons which had led to the alteration of the original resolutions.
			The first resolution charged (in aid of the Cus- toms establishments) upon all articles, except corn, grain, or flour, and timber and wood goods, upon importation, per package or parcel, Id. ; animals, per head, Id. ; goods in bulk, for each unit of entry, Id.; with power to the Lords of the Trea- sury to frame regulations for adjusting the amount of such payments in certain cases by altering the unit of entry, or quantity or number of goods, so that the charge shall as little as may be exceed one quarter per cent. on the goods of the lowest value ; and on each entry of goods for exportation (being a copy of the bill of lading, with the particulars and value of the goods endorsed) a duty of ls. 6d.
			This resolution, after considerable discussion, was agreed to.
			The next resolution charged (in aid of the Cus- toms establishments) a Customs due of 10s. per cent. on the amount of Customs duty payable on goods warehousedand removed under bond from one place to another, and of 5s. per cent. on goods warehoused and not removed, to be paid in each case on taking such goods out of bond for home consumption; tobacco to be chargeable with only half the above rates, and no more than 5sa., in addition to 5s. per cent., upon any single delivery of sugars when re- moved under bond.
			This resolution was likewise agreed to, and, with the other, ordered to be reported.
			The adjourned debate on the second readinv of the Refreshment Houses and WVine Licenses Bill0was then resumed.
			Mr. CBoo1 moved to defer the second reading for siX months. He objected to the Bill, that it increased immensely the facilities for the consump- tion of intoxicating liquors, although the number of places licensed for the sale of wines was ample, thereby tending to demoralize the people.
			The amendment was seconded by Mr. DiGnv SEYsoun, who contended that the fiscal benefit exDected from this French Wine Bill had been much exaggerated; that upon sanitary grounds it sould fail; and that upon moral and soCal grounds it was incompatible with the welfare of the com- munity. He objected to the arbitrary machinery of the Bill, which, he said, would introduce with French wine a French police.
			Mr. K. SmE. ER said he was not surprised at the opposition offered to this measure, which had to deal vith two different but well-organized parties. He did not think any demoralization would follow the giving a fair chance to the consumption of wine and that it was an anomaly to exclude it from houses of refreshment. The power which, in some cases, the Bil gavo to the magistrates was, in his
			opinion, too large. Eoexamined the plea set up by the licensed victuallers adverse to the Bill, disputing many of their allegations, and contended thaS their opposition was a selfsh one.
			Mr. H&amp;aDY observed that, whereas the primary object of the Bill was revenue, he agreed with Mr. SsExOoRn that the ravenne would not be materially increased by it. Bnt asguming that there wvould be a large consumption of wine, according to the hypothesis of the CH.NCmaon of the ExcuxQuiss, there would be no diminution of theronsumption of beer and spirits, the object being to give perfect free- domfrom restrictions. This freedom of trade in liquorshadexisted longago,and he showed theeff&amp;cta of successive experiments in legislation on this sub- jectin multiplying beerhonses and the temptation to dranken men. This measure was to secure free trade in wmne; but he denied that the principle of free trade applied to this case. Then, ws there any cal for this Bill? He asserted that opinion was strongly against it. The definitions in the Bill were, he insisted, so imperfecl, as to what were refresh- ment houses and what eating-houses that it would be impossible to establish checks as to the nature of the houses and against disorderly houses, while itplaced a secret and irresponsible power inthehandsof the ma- gistrates and of the police. The formerwotlldbecome odious, and everything would be thrown into con- fusion. The consumption of spirits was diminish- ing, partly by the temperance morement, but prin- cipally through moral and social causes, and the increasing consumption of tea, coffee and cocos, and he asked the House wfhether they wrould supply the place of these articles by wines from foreign coun- tries,s stimulating their use by increased compcetition.
			On the motion of Mr. ARYToN, the debate was again adjourned.
			Leave was given to introduce certain Bills, and, after some other business, the House adjourned at a quarter past 12 o'clock.

			We are accustomed to anticipate that posterity w'll care about the history of many laws which posterity wil be well content to accept as results; and it is very possible that posterity may never inquire how Mr. GLADSTONE laboured, and may never know that Mr. A=ro. existed. But, if we can suppose that in a more reasonable age men should disentomb the Debate of last night, they must speculate very freely upon the peculiar character of the reasoning faculty of their ancestors. They will find that more than one sitting of the House of Commons has been already devoted, and that other sittings of the House of Commons are stil to be devoted, to a contest whether it is essential to public morals that the function of eating should be separated from the function of drinking. They will observe that the greatest intellects of the country were brought out in active and earnest antagonism upon the question whether the laws ought to allow an Englishman to quench his thirst under the same roof under which he satisfie3 his hunger. It will be seen that a large proportion of the representa- tives of the people were strenuous and immovable in their conviction that the public peace and public morals required that a British subject should drink his beer and should imbibe his gin, his brandy, and his wine in special palaces consecrated to drinking and smoking, jollity, and drunkenness, but that he should eat his dinner in another house, where it was forbidden by law to supply him with a draught even of light French wine to slake his thirst or moisten his food. It wiU then be noticed as among the mysteries of former times that the brewers and distillers were among the most vehement opponents of any toleration of men eating while they drank; and, more mysterious stilL that a fanatical sect, which professed to abhor both brewers and distillers and inculcated a doctrine of total abstinence from al fermented beverages, mustered in full force to uphold the temples of drunkenness and to drive into them every sated man, full and thirsty with food.
			Such contradictions, inconsistencies, and ab- surdities are very humiliating; but we are not, in reality, nearly such fools as they would make us appear. As to the fanatics, it has been found that great philanthropy is not an un- usual concomitant with beer-making and spirit- distiling. Whether even they are so ridiculously senseless as they would seem is doubtfuL But, as to the other parties to this aDparently irra- tional discussion, they are dealing with hard material interests, and if we should merely change the terms " public peace" and " public morals" into " the private interests of brewers and licensed " victuallers," we should see at once that this attempt to separate eating from drinking is not only ridiculous, but iniquitous. The struggle to make the labouring man of every class, who is com- pelled by his avocations to dine away from his home, eat his dinner athirst, or send to some distant privileged monopolist to buy his drink, is reaUy a struggle to maintain a system which gives power to magistrates, wealth to great brewers, and pro- sperity to a protected class of publicans. But, as it is not convenient to put the argument in this form, the "magistrates" are altered to " public
			sobriety ;" the " brewers" to " public morals ;" and the " publicans" to " the public peace." Stripped of its disguise, it is nothing more than the old Protectionist argument of the abso- lute necessity of taxing and annoying the general community for the benefit of par- ticular classes. We might well wonder how 1,200 petitions, with 120,000 siguatures, could be got up against the proposition to allow a man to swallow weak wine with his food, if we could not explain the fact by another fact which is told us by the same gentleman-namely, that there are 105,000 publicans and beershop keepers who are aUl anxious that no such privilege should be allowed. Do Mr. CROOE and Mr. '. D. S017Pr., who led the Opposition last night, venture to tell us they doubt that these petitions were all got up bythe publichouse keepers? Yet Mr. CnooE, who has numbered the puablichouse keepers and beer- shop keepers of Bolton, and finds them amount to 360-all of whom, doubtless, have votes-tells us that he utterly repudiates all sympathy with them, while he would confine the supply of all liquors to their agency; and Mr. Sm-mouR, while declar- ing that five-sixths of the crime of the country is directly referrible to publichouses and beershops, would drive every man into these places to quench his thirst. We hope that foreign nations will believe that we are not such a nation of simpletons as either to use or to be swayed by such nonsensical pretences as these. The sincere teetotallers, as
			they can themselves, are necessarily, from the very nature of the tyrannical interference they would execise over the conduct of their fellow- men, people of the smalest instruction and of the narrowest minds. Weakl, bigoted, and conceited, they are the ready-made dupes of any shrewder class which requires some harmless name to conceal a selfish purpose. They sign the publi- cans' petitions and they urge the brewers' cause, and they fondly believe that if they can make their feUow-creatures drink bad alcohol and adulterated beer, instead of pure beer and pure wine, they are doing GoD service. If they could so contrive it-and by the aid of their allies it would not be very difficult-that every glass of beer or spirits should pro- duce immediate delirium trewens, they would be even more energetic in their petitions than they have been. But then teatotallers are only the masks of this pantomime; beneath those masks there are very matter-of-fact faces. The cause is so bad that it must be disguised in some fashion. Mr. CRooE does not dare, in very shame, to stand up for the interests of his 360 pothouse constituents without disavowing all syrapathy with them, and those 3G0 astute men
			wil pardon Br. C}:ooEs' disavowal if he wil preserve them their monopoly. It is the tyranny of the rich over the poor, of the strong over the weak. It is the tyranny also of money force over reason and Common sense; and it is the more disgustingo because the strong, the rich, and the unscrupulous are using what in some mouths may be but folly, but what in others must be hypocrisy, to cover their own purposes.
			Undoubtedly the Licensed Victuallers' intere5t and the Beershop interest is very strong in the country, and the Brewer ard Distiller interest is very strong in Parlament. It requires great moral courage in a representative to resist the first two, and great strength of purpose in a Ainister to resist the last two. The metropolitan boroughB are almost in the hands of the publicans, and there is not a borough in the country where their influence is not largely felt. Add the natural love of power an.d the occasional pleasure oi jobbing which incline a portion of the magistracy to the side of a monopoly placed in their gift, and we can in some degree appreciate the tremendoua weight of the influences brought to liear upon this division. Many a man feels that his seat depends upon the side he shall take, and some, perhaps, saw in it last night a hope of forming a com- pact phalanx of supporters for another election, where their chances might otherwise havo been des- perate. Great credit, therefore, is due to those who have been bold enough to take the side of sobriety and common sense against these two united forces of fanaticism and monopoly. Mrr. AYxroN has again succeeded in adjourning the Debate, and his clients will be eertain to die hardL But even his best policy would be to hill his tyrants at once. When this Refreshment Bill has passed there wrill be at least as many Refreshment House-keepers who will wish well to those who called them into being as there wVil be publicans who wil resent Ithe interference with their monopoly. We are
			ashamed to suggest such a consideration as this, but the -whole contest is of such a nature that we are obliged to appeal to low motives in order to write down to our subject.

			The QuarterlyReturns of the Revenue andExpen- diture, which we published yesterday, tell their own story. Indeed, there is nothing from which mytery has so utterly departed. Taxation has become a purely engineering process; given the power, and you know the result. Last Session the CiAs- csu.ot of the Excnxqnu put an additional four- pence on the Property-tax for the current year; and, as the greater part of the addition entered into the Quarter just ended, the result is the amazing figures of 6,002,0001.,against 2,4S3,0001. in the corresponding Quarter of last Jear. It has been done by the stroke of a pen. We all remember how pleasantly Mr. GLADSTONE told the House they must pay another fourpence, and how sweetly they took the infliction. There was hardly a murmur, and, if there was, r r. GLnADsTowv Esoo hushed it. He now sweeps into the till, in the aecount of this Quarter alone, though, of course, for the whole year, 3,519,000l. It appears to be ascertained that the Income-tax produces about 1,200,0001. a-penny. The mouths of Con- tinental financiers must water when they see a mere " Open, sesame," elicit suchwealth. Ites all the same trouble-as easy to say 10d. as 2d., and a shilling as either. This is too like the mastery acquired by modern science over vast masses of material, which places them at the mercy of a hey, a tonacock, s spark, or a wire. With a turn of the wrist or a touch of the finger you may discharge a cliff into the sea, blow up a city, flood half a province, place a theatre in darkness, or do anything one can think of in reason. The CHAcErLos of the ExcHBQuxn puts the index of the Property-tax to 10, and he knows the result to within a few thousands. Next to the tyrant's wish that all the citizens of Rome had one neck among them, nothing can be more summary and comprehensive. We all of us know what is meant by a thermometer at 25, what by zero, and what by 90. The bare figures make us shiver or swelter. So Income-tax at 3d. or 12d. are positivo sensations. The one smacks of reduced Estinmates and Administrative Reform; the other of Ans- sTRoNG guns and steam three-deckers. To an Egyptian imagination the figures of the Nilometer are consolatory or portentous as the case may be. In the Income-tax the figure is not the index, but the regulator, and gives us perfect command of the supply. How fortunate that such an instrument is in British hands ! In the Eastern apologue the two shepherds could have either a rivulet or the Ganges, as they vished it, through their land. The one got some water meadows, the other was washed away. It can hardly be said that Mr. Gx&amp;nsToxs is content With a rill; but Heaven save us if NAproxoN ILL had to choose! Think of such a man being able to whisper " Two francs," and bring down twenty- five millions sterling! Yet it appears that the British OCANcEmoB of the ExCHEQUER, With the concurrence of Parliament, has the power, if he has also the will.
			But when our neighbours hear of this prodligy -just 5,000,0001. added to the revenue by a word, all in one evening, and without the least additional trouble-they 'will have a misgiving. It wvll occur to them that the poor taxpayer, upon whom they have tried all sorts of tricks, and whose paying powers they have probed to-the uttermost, must be a man of finite resources. There is a bottom to every jug, and it can do no more than run over. If you take it out in Income-tax, you will get the less out of expenditure. Very true. The philosophy of taxation is universaL You cannot have it in meal and in malt too. Nay, if you seixe the income which the owner had destined for profitable employment, you run near the folly of klillig the goose that laid the golden eggs. So, up Income-tax, down Customs and Excise. This might be true of France, or of Austria, or the SuLTAN'S dominions, but it is not true of England; at least, there is no sign of it. Here, in this very Return for the Quarter ended last Saturday night, notwithstanding the im- mense sum of 6,000,0001. taken bodily out of our pockets for Income-tax; and notwithstanding the immense increase of three and a-half millions, comparing Quarter with Quarter, there is no de- crease, but a very large increase, in the indirect taxes-that is, those on expenditure. One exception, indeed, there is, if exceDtion it may be called. On the comparison of the Quarter there is 363,0001. less for Customs. Bnt this is easily accounted for. The trade in foreign wine, spirits, silks, and other Continental articles, has been almost suspended since the financial statement, everybody waiting till the duties came of, or were reduced. So there has been first a temporary cessation of trade, then a lower scale of duties, and in some cases no duties at aO. This has made the difference. In the Quarter'a Excise there is so great an increase that we can hardly believe it entirely accoumted for b_y the increased consumption of malt, hops, and paper, great as it appears to have been. It is 1,320,0004l Stamps, too, have yielded 6G,0001. moro than in the same Quarter last year, which is encouraging for Alr. GLADsroT'a grand scheme of new Stamp Duties. The Post-office has been more productive by 85,0001., and tha cc iscellanueous"-we always dread to inquire what it includes-figures for 388,0001. Altogether, tho net increase on the Quarter is over five millions. So much for the comparison of Quarter wita
			Quarter. The comparison of Year with Year can only be a review of old news. The Quarter just ended is the most remarkable feature in it. But the gum total of the year's Revenue is worth notice. It iLa 71,089,6691.
			What a figure ! What a revenue I It is no -mere matter of account; no ahadowy estimate; no anticjuarian computation of drachmns; no -1wollen sum in reals; but geventy-one million golden sovereigns actually collected and paid into the British Treasury. What self-complacency -uch a sum might inspire ! What regrets it might tuggest ! It wouId harrow the feelings of the pa- iraot or the philanthropist too much to suggest what Might be done with all this money, besides build- ing three-deckers to rot in Portsmouth harbour, -or paying men for doing nothing, or worse. In point of fact, however, such a sum will never be collected, except on the stimulus -of national danger or national glory. We don't probe every pocket and every conscience In the 'country for the sake of Palladian designs, or even Parisian Boulevards, or anything we can exist 'Without. War is stil the incentive of great efforts. War, national jealousy, prowess,-in a word, the warrior, by sea or by land, is the story of this Quarterly Return, as it is of the grandest histories, -poems, and speeches in all ages. How solemnly PnaICEs would have stated these figures; with what pomp DmiosTRizss would have drawPn them -oat ! Tney are too suggestive of what Eng- land can do, if it wishes. A nation that can raise '70,000,0001. a-yearcanas easilyraiae100,000,0001. True, the money is withdrawn from trade and from private enjoyment. If we choose to throw all our savings into the State chest we must go on building with brick instead of stone; we must let the Yankees carry off our old pictures and books; we must let the village labourer remain much the zame hardworking clodhopper he was a hundred years ago. But why not ? The State, with all its grandeur, its fleets, and its armies, is the property -of all. Our glory, our Empire, our colonies and de- pendencies belong to all. Whatever happens to us we are still Englishmen, as our children will be after us. But let us stop. This comes of a rentroll of 71,000,0001. It makes us all proud, extrava- gant, and careless of the morrow. Perhaps it is fortunate that the shoe pinches in one point at least. The Income-tax will keep alive the tradition of economy, if nothing else will. Nobody pays his 10d. in the pound without a prayer for the soul of JosEpn Huis, and a wish that he were here ,or had left a worthy successor. But now that COBDE; and BRiGHT are mediatized we fear the race is extinct. ixoriare aliguis ! you have plenty -to do. Think of 71,000,0001. a-year to be ope-
			zated upon.

			We rejoice to learn that measures are likely to be taken for removing a foul stigmna from the com- mercial reputation of England. Perhaps the reader may remember a trial which took place a year or two ago, and which turned upon a practice esta- blished in certain trades, of using not only false measures, but false qualities, and stamping these fraudulent bargains with the name and address of some respectable and popular firm. The case 'was taken out of the category of common cheating by the deliberation and concert employed in the matter, and by the adoption of the system sas an allowable method of conducting busi- ness. A dealer, for instance, sold a reel of cotton warranted to contain 100 yards, and marked as of that length, but containing in reality only 40 or 50. This, of course, was false measure, but the enormity of the evil consisted in the fact that the article had been deliberately ordered of short length, manufactured of short length, invoiced as such, and openly treated as such in every stage of the transaction from first to last, except when it was Eold over the counter. Shopkeepers sent their orders to manufacturing houses for so many reels of cotton or tape, or so many pieces of cloth, to be made and delivered with so many yards short of the professed measure. To com- plete the deception a further order was given for the name or mark of some well-established firm to be affixed to the goods, until at length the articles were brought into the market with every- thing false about them. They were not what they prufessed to be in measure, in quality, or in make. Iu every one of these respects the purchaser was systematically defrauded, not by the mere trickery of some peddling or poverty-stricken huckster, but by regular commercial concert on a large scale between producers and retailers. This was what made the case so flagrant, and the evil, of course, when it had 'nce taken root, was not long in spreading. One dealer after another had to face the alternative of 'either yielding to the temptation or suffering for his honesty, and one manufacturer after another became compelled to execute fraudulent orders, which, if he had refused them, would have been un- dertak-en by a rival house. These false bargains, too, wero distributed all over the world, and British character disgraced accordingly in every quarter 'of the globe. At lenpgth, however, the Board of Trade has been moved to interfere, and a Bill, it is hoped, will be so framed as to put an effectual etop to the svstem.
			Nothing could illustrate the scandal and shame- fessness of the practice better than the conference ield ivth the Board of Trade on the subject. It was almost a question whether the fraud had not been naturalized,-whether the system had not acquired a certain lawful character by its very publicity and extent. MIr. MmxER GissoN; asked whether a reel or bobbin purportng to contain 100 yards, but really containing less, might not, by the common consent and under- standing prevailing on the subject, be passed as 100 yards without warranting the imputation of fraud ? This, indeed, was actually the defence net up by the beersellers some time ago, when told that their quart bottles were not quarts, nor their -int bottles pints. They answered, as MIr. M. GrBsoN fears the bobbinsellers might answer, that, whether the measure was full or short, their -customers understood it. 'What was the use of referring to the old tablo of " Ale and Beer Men- "sure," which contained no such measture as a "bottle," and no such quantity as a " dozen ?" Perhaps " bottles" might have been originally either pints or quarts, but they might have in- sensibly degenerated, or shrunk in washing. At any rate, the reckoning, however strange, misled mobody; people got what they ordered and what they expected, and the contrast between the actual and nominal measure was only one of those acci- dents which the change of things was always bring- Ing about. In the end, a species of compromise was effected by the introduction of a new term into -the trade, and " reputed" quarts or real quarts m3ight be ordered at discretion.
			These ingenious arguments, however, will not fit the case now before the public. Happily for the cause of honesty, a yard is a yard, and a hundred moans a hundred; nor can any " understanding," tlowever universal, between manufacturers andl retailers affect the transactions between retailers =nd customers. The man who buys the cottoh ever the counter is certainly no party to the -cheat; in fact, if he were in the secret there -need be no secret at all, nor any false pretence about the matter. The whole thing is got up at his expense, manufacturer and retailer conspirlng toge- ther to defraud him of half his measure. Moreover, besides the false label, there is the false mark. The -urchaser is not only misled by a printed lie, tell- ing him that he gets 100 yards when he only gets
			50, but this lHe is backed by the theft of a respectable name. To make the beer case parallel to thi we must Imagine that a retailer not only gave short measure, but wrote to his brewer deliberately ordering an adulterated article, and bespealdng a false brand of BAnor.y and PsaxNs to give currency to the fraud.
			A second source of possible difficulty was also hit by hlr. Gissoa when he asked whether these short measures were sold at short prices If this were the case the gravamea would certainly have been lighter. When a man insists on getting for a penny an article notoriously worth twopence he must expect a proportionately bad bargain. If half the charge as well as half the mea- sure is subtracted, the transaction remains much the same as before, and is simply a sham from beginning to end. But this is not the fact. The cheat is concerted directly for the profit of the retailers. They pay the manufacturers a short prine for the short measure, but they charge the public the full price as if for a full measure, and pocket the difference. That is the real object of the whole tranaction. The retailer deliberately orders false measure in order that he may pay a smaller cost price and make a large profit. If taxed with the fraud, he says he knows nothing of the matter, that he is not the manufacturer, that he sells the thing as he bought it, and cannot be answerable for mistakes.
			It is not very remarkable that a new law should be required to meet such a state of things, for laws constantly arise out of special embarrassments; but it is really surprising that a custom so disgraceful should find its defenders. It appears, however, that firms pretending to respectability of character insist upon the maintenance of the system, and it has, we believe, been found impossible to obtain a common expression of opinion even against forged trade marks. Dealers persist in demanding that articles shall be manufactured for them with marks or brands to which they have no claim, so that the customer is deceived on the one hand, while the trader whose name is borrowed suffers on the other. We do sincerely trust that the law may bring these persons to a better sense of their duty, and that they may learn from its penalties what they ought to have known from the simple teaching of their consciences.

			The daily newspaper has taken the place of the elaborate historical performance of other days. Time was when a great statesman or an eminent literary man used to give to the world the result of his meditations in a solemn quarto, or a volume of even more ponderous size. There they are upon our shelves, " works which no gentleman's library " should be without." They have but one defect -nobody reads them. If any one of our contemporaries would become acquainted with the history of his own time, we may, without vanity, be permitted to suggest that a file of The Times for the last twenty or thirty years would be about the best history that he could consult. The transactions of the British nation in Statecraft, in domestic policy, in mili- tary and naval achievements, in art, in literature, in science, are therein recorded from day to day. Not only is this journal a record of the perform- ances of the Anglo-Saxon race, but, as far as we can make it so, it is a chronicle of all events which affect the destinies of mankind from one end of the world to the other. There is, however, in our daily issue one portion of this journal which may be said to play the part of the preliminary chapters in MACAULAY'S Ifistry. This is the Law and the Police Reports. If any one would attain a key to the forms of English life in the year 1860, he would do well to read carefully from day to day these records of conflicting interests and crime. Were it not for these reports nobody would know how it is that the three milions of persons who live and move and have their being in this great town of London play their parts on earth. In our impression of yesterday nearly one page of this journal was occupied with the report of a trial which showed how the speculative Greek, the ostensible corn- dealer, contrives for a time to hold his own in the City of London, and to delude the commercial world-those sharp City people, before whom we are all accustomed to bow down in admiration of their acuteness and super- human arithmetical powers. A Greek named AY-ToYio Di DEmETRIO opened business a few years back as a corn merchant upon nothing at all, and contrived to fail a few months back for 60,0001. This was a wonderful achievement to have been performed in tho presence of so many sharp, keen- witted men. ANTONIo carried on business in Old Broad-street. Of his private life we know nothing. That of his brother appears to have been passed mainly in the neighbourhood of Notting-hill, as a lodger with ladies, to whom sometimes he paid, and sometimes he did not pay, his rent; but throughout it all he contrived for a very considerable period to maintain his character as the great Greek merchant.
			Now, the way in which this worthy got embroiled with our English courts of law was twofold. In the first place, he made his appearance in the Bankruptcy Court, and there he admitted that his liabilities were 60,0001., his assets nil. In the next place, out of his embarrassments there arose a tri which was decided on Saturday last at King- ston, being the one to which we have referred as illustrative of City life in the year 1860. A-oToxIo's assignees tried their right in a cargo of wheat valued at 2,0001., for the benefit of the creditors. On the other hand, it was attempted to show that previously to the bankruptcy his interest in this cargo had been disposed of in the fair way of business, for cash, to a certain lady, who in her turn disposed of the cargo to the Messrs. HMux, corm merchants in Corlk The only real question for the jury was whether the sale to MIss aA MARTL WaS a genuine one; but the whole of the trial is a real chapter in London life. AYToNio had a brother called N[cnoLAs. As they could not get on by fair means they took the opposite course. Besides the place of business of which we have already spoken, they engaged a counting-house in Gresham-house, and two others in the neighbourhood of Old Broad- street, and established sham firms under the names of LEBous and Co., DALco and Co., and Jouzz LAirBE. They then hired a number of boys to act as clerks at each of these counting-houses, with- out payment. Their only employment in the offices was to fill up bills of exchange in different names. There were two or three books, but no one ever saw any one write in them. The office of LEBous, Brothers, and Co. was a sample of the rest. There was nothing in it but a desk and a stool. LEBOUS, Brothers, in the form of a single foreign gentle- man, used to come to the office every morning and smoke cigars; that, and the filling up of the bills of exchange, constituted the only kind of business transacted in the establishment. In the course of their dealings a cargo of corn had been shipped on board a vessel called the Gloria at a Russian port in the Black Sea. The vessel reached this country in the month of Octo- ber of last year, but ATroxio had been declared a bankrupt in the preceding August. The bill of lading for the cargo by the Gloria had been endorsed to the firm of LEBous and Co., but it is melancholy to add that in the latter end of August a gentleman, who represented in his own person the firm of LEBous, Brothers, etarted by the mail train for Dover, and has uever been
			heard of since. It was urged by the counsel for the plaintis, that Messrs. HALT, who had pur- chased the cargo from Mis AfAr-, a lady who was an entire stranger to them, stopping at an hotel, acted, to say the least, without due caution, and could scarcely hope to defend their title when the good faith of their veudor was seriously im- pugned. The whole matter then turned upon whether the sale to Miss MANTix was bona fide or not, and, in point of fact, the interest of the tzial was concentrated upon the exami- nation and cross-examnation of this lady. We learn thus much of her history. Miss MAy AsN-N
			BRoGETr MAnRTn resides at Iansdowne-row, Not- ting-hilL Her mother was of Dutch extracton, and at the decease of her parent she became enti- tled-as she represented it-to money amounting in all to a considerable sum. With this money she entered upon this speculation in Russian corn. Evidence was given on the other side, and it was elicited from herself, in the course of cross- examination, that, though she might be possessed of unbounded wealth, she was always in trouble with the small tradesmen in her neighbourhood. For example, we find this lady, just at the moment that she is engaged in her corn speculation, paying to her laundress 11. on account one week and 7B. at another. She gave the very plauible excuse that she was speculating with her money at the time, and therefore was not able to square ac- counts with her tradesmen. It was, however, curious that this lady had received NicHoas A ns D F TRIO as a lodger, and that, although she was obliged to sue him for a sum he owed her for board and lodging, they remained, by the lady's own ad- mission, fast friends until the period of the bank- ruptcy. It was more curious that in August of last year she should have consented to act upon the casual suggestion of a person named JoHx Lar, not forthcoming and whose address she never knew, who recommended her to invest her spare capital in the purchase of a cargo of bar.ley. It was still more curious that on Sunday, the 21st of August, Miss MAR-i, accompanied by a lady, should have met Mr. LINME inl Kensington-gardens and with a young foreign gentleman, lasous, Brothers, who had the corn to sell. In a few days the trans- action was completed, and Miss MARTu received a receipt in the name of LEsous, Brothers, for 1,8991. ISBs and IsEous have disappeared, and NTICHOLAS DanarRio is not to be founLd. This gentleman was very unfortunate, for, inde- pendently of the losses he had incurred in conse- quence of his brother's bankruptcy, he had insured a house at Kensington, and a fire unfortunately took place a day or two after the policy was effected. Miss MAnTr, too, was unfortunate, for she stoutly maintained throughout her exami- nationthat she had purchased the cargo of the Gloria for value, but the jury could not be brought to believe her statement. A verdict was found for the assignees, and Miss AsARTcN was left to her remedy against the respective houses of DEM7nrasO, Brothers, Iinous, Brothers, DALGo and Co., &amp;c.

			THE BTsHorRic OF ANTiGuA.-Her Majesty has been pleased to nominate to the bishopric of Axntigna, which became vacant nearly a year ago by the death of the Rev. Dr. Stephen Rigaud, formerly Felow of Exeter College, Oxford, and Head-master of Ipswich Grammar School, the Rev. W. W. Jackson, Chaplain to the Forces at Barbadoes and to the Bishop of that dlocess. Mr. Jackson, who is a native of Barbadoes, was educated at Codrington Colege, through which he passed with great distinction. He is on his way to England, and will, In all probability, be conse- creted at the same time and place with Archdeacon Wigram, who has been nominated to the bishopric of Rochester. Bishop Jackson will have episcopal jurlsdiction over Antigua, Nevis, St. Kitt'e, Montserrat, Virgin Islands and Dominica, compridng an extent of 751 square miles, with a population of about 108,000. The bishopric is worth 2,0001., which is paid out of the Consolidated Fund. There are about 50 clergyen in the diocess. The bishop-designate belongs to the Evangelic or Low Church party, and is described as being a very energetic clergyman and very popular in the colony which he Is leaving.
			THEg FATAL POACHING AggB&amp;y If HEITS.- The inquest on the unfortunate man, John Seabrook, wLo was killed on the estate of Sir Thomas Sebright, at 3eechwood, on Thursday morning last, by a gan- shot wound from a poacher, commenced on Saturday afternoon before Mr. Day, coroner. The evidence of only one witness was taken, that of Matthew Burgess, who was one of the keepers present when Seabrook was shot. The coronerexpresseda wish that the press would notpublish the evIdenceuntil theconcluslon oftheinqnest. Wemayhow. ever state,without any probability of our impeding the course of justice, one or two of the principal facts In Burgess's evidence. It appears that the three keepers came up to the three poachers at a spot where two paths cross each other in a wood. As soon as the keepers, who knew the poachers were close at hand, saw the men, they sprang at them, but were received by two shots, one oF which kiled Seabrook on the spot, and the other seriously wounded another keeper named Thomas Cook. Mlatthew Burgess, the third keeper, at once made his escape. Neither of the keepers had guns, but the deceased had a six-barrel revolver in his pocket. Previous to Burgess's escaping ens of the men struck at him with the butt end of his gun, but Burgess warded off the blow with his stiek. The inauest was adjourned till next Saturday week. Five menhave been aprehended on suspicion of being concerned in the affair.
			37EspERz ExCOU,rscTER-A most desperate en- counter occurred at Sheffield, at an early hour on Sunday morning, between a burglarand the landlordof the Ebenezer tavern, in Russell-street. A little before 1 o'clock Mrs. Gregory, the landlady of the beerhouse, was awoL-e by a noise in her bedroom, and on iooklng at the foot of the bed she saw a man cronched against the drawers, rifling her husband's trousers pockets. She at once awoke her husband, and immediately the burglar discovered he was seen he attempted to get to the door, but Gregory jumped out of bed, and, seizing him by the collar, they struggled together on the floor, but, the bur- glar being the stronger of the two, he got out of the room on to the landing at the head of the etaircsse. The landlord still retained his hold of him, the burglar dragging Gregory down the stairs. The front door leading into a large yard, had previously been unbolted and placed wide open, so that when the two reached 'he bottom of the stairs the thief had no difficulty In dragging his opponent into the yard. As they -r-e In the act of passing through the door Gregory struck the burglar a desperato blow under the ear and both fell together under the body of a cart which was standing in the yard. After a strnugle of five or six minutes the thief again got the upper hand, and dragged Gregory towards the gateway, leading Into the street. Fortunately, assistance now arrived, for the landlord's cries of ' Police' ! and the wife's screams of " Murder !" had attracted the attention of Serjeant Moore and a watchman, and these going to the help of Gregory brought the strugle to a conclusion, and the thief was taken into custody. The officers recognized him as a discharged policemn nmed Peter Lyann-Afanokastcr &amp;miner.

			[ATEST INTELLIGENCE.
			OPE&amp;rINTG OF THE SARDININ CHAMBERS.
			THE KING'S SPEECTh
			[A portion of the following appeerd in our second edi- tion of yeaterdsy:-]
			The following telegrams have bsen received at Mr. Ileater's office-
			"The Sardinian Chambers were opened to-day.
			"Eis Majesty entered the hall of the Senate amid indescribable applause, and delivered the fol- lowing speech:-
			" ' Signo-i &amp;nnaoari, kigynori Depuaai,
			"c' The last time I opened Parliament, amid the troubles of Italy and the dangers of the State, faith in Divine justice encouraged me to augur well of our destiny.
			"' In a very short time an invasion was repulsed. Iombardy was freed by glorious deeds of heroism, and Central Italy became free by the marvellous virtue of its inhabitants, and thus to-day the repre- sentatives of the rights and the hopes of the nation are assembled around me.
			" ' For such a benefit we are indebted to a mag- nanimous ally, to the valour of his and our soldiers, to the assistance ^of volunteers, and to the per- severing concord of the people. We ascribe the merit of it to God, as without superhuman aid such memorable enterprises cannot be accomplished.
			"' The gratitucde of present and future genera, tions is due to France for the welfare of Italy, and for consolidating the union of the two nations, who have some community in origin, principle, and destiny.
			"c' It was necessary to make some sacrifce, and I have made that which was dearest to my heart.
			" ' Reserving the vote of the people and the approbation of Parliament, and reserving also in regard to Switzerland the guarantee of her inter- national rights, I have concluded a treaty for the reunion of Savoy and the surrounding territory of Nice with France.
			" ' We have still many difficulties to overcome; but, assisted by public opinion and by the love of my people, I shall never permit any one to offend or forget any right or liberty.
			"' I;Firm, like my ancestors, in the Catholic' reli- gion and in the respect due to the supreme chief of that religion, I shall, if the ecclesiastical authority makes use of spiritual arms for temporal interests, in safe conscience and in the traditions of my worthy ancestors find strength to maintain entire the civil liberty and authority for which I am only indebted to God and to my people.
			" ' The provinces of the.Emiliahavebeenarranged as in formcr times; but with Tuscany, who has her own laws and her own rules, a special temporal pro- vision was necessary.
			" ' The short time since, and the rapidity of the event, have impeded the preparation of the laws which are necessary to assist and strengthen the new estate. For the first period of legislation you will only have to discuss the most urgent measures, and my Ministers will prepare with due deliberation the projects upon which you will have to deliberate for the second period.
			" ' Based on the Statute of the country, the poli- tical, military, and financial unity, and the uni- formity of the civil and penal laws, the progressive administrative liberty of the provinces and com- munes will renew in the Italian people that splendid and vigorous existence which, at the time of another form of civilization and of other territorial arrange. ments of Europe, was the fruit of the municipal autonomy which is to-day opposed to the constitu- tion of strong States and to the genius of the nation.
			'SignoriSeuntori, Signori Deputati,
			"' In entering upon the new order of things, and without regarding the old political parties in any other way than remembering the services ren- dered to the common cause, we call for a noble co-operation and the expression of every sincere opinion, in order to obtain our prin- cipal object,-the welfare of the people and the greatness of the country, which Is no longer the Italy of the Romans nor that of the Middle Ages. It must no more be left a field open to foreign ambition, but it must, on the contrary, be the Italy of the Italians.' "

			IBBLAND.
			DUBLN, MwNOxAY MIoanG. THE EXODUS.
			For nearly two years or so it was pretty generally supposed that the exodus of the Irish peasantry was accomplished, and that until another generation arose we should hear no more of that marvellous decrease in the population which foLowed the famine of 1845-6. The figures, however, sup- plied by Mr. Donelly's last statistics have dissipated that idea, and their truthfulness has been corroborated by the accounts which have come from the provinces since the opening of the emigration season. Advices from Cork of Satur- day's date state that on the previous day upwards of 300 passengers were embarked at Queenstown, for New York, on board the Edinburgh, by the local agents, Messrs. C. and W. D. Seymour and Co. The Messrs. Scott also embarl;ed a large number of passengers in the Anglo-Saxon for Portland. The emigrants were, many of them, attended as far as Queenstown by their relatives and friends, and the scene presented on the piers and quays as they parted was one of great animation and interest. From the port of Sligo iv is stated that during the past month there has been a regular flight of emigrants from the west of Ireland. On Friday nearly 200 emigrants passed through Sligo for America by way of Liverpool, not to speak of those going by salway. The great majority of them was from Belmullet, in the county of M[ayo. A considerable number also belonged to the county of Sligo. The tide of emigration (says a local paper) has set in in right earnest from the western province.

			AAMICA.
			LIVERPOOL, AeRa Z
			The America arrived here this morning from Boston and Halifax id Queenstown, with dates to the 21st and 23d respectively, and from New Yor'k by telegraph idv the latter port to the evening of the 22d ult. At U 50 a.m. on the 28th ult. she passed the steamship Kangaroo, hence, and at 910 p.m. the Royal Mail steamship Persia, hence.
			The steamship Teutonia, from Hamburg tid Southampton, had arrived at New York.
			The proceedings in the Senate have been entirely of a national character. A Bill forthe construction of 50 steamships adapted to the African coast, for the suppression of the slave trade; a joint resolu- tion, authorizing the President to negotiate with other nationa for the right of search within 200 miles of the westeru coast of Africa, and an order instructing the Judiciary Committee to report a Bill substituting imprisonment for life inlstead of death, and applying the penalty to persons fitting out slave ships, were offered or introduced by Mr. Wtilson. The HIouse of Reresentatives had refused to rescind the rale which restricts a member to one hour in debate. The Washington correspondence of the New York7 Herald reports that the settlement of Spanish claims had given rise to the statement relative to the sale of Cuba to the Utnited States.
			Washington letters state that the Senate had a short executive session on the 20th ult., and had taken preliminary measures with the view of resusci- tating the Nicaragua Treaty, which was recently re- jected. Much feeling is said to prevail about there- jection, as it upsets the calculations of 16 years, as well as the Treaty of Nicaragua with Great Britain, and the understanding between the United States and Great Britain. Indications of success are said to prevail, but it was doubted if the treaty can be reconsidered or the Mexican Treaty be re- vived. The Washington correspondent of the New YorkZ Jourwnal of Commerce con6rms the doubt. The Republicans refused to ratify the treaty, in consequence of the Administration and its sup- porters insisting on inserting and retaining in it the clause by which the President, and not Con- gress, should determine on the use of armed force. Letters from Washington also state that Mr. M'Lane, havingrefused to act upon discretionary or general orders, had received emphatic and explicit instructions to land troops at Vera Cruz for the protection of the American Consulate and citizens and property. It is stated that on the 24th of May and the 30th of July last, he was authorlzed to offer $10,000,000 for Lower California, and the right of way from the Rio Grande to Mazatlan and from Arizona to Guaymas, but that, Juarez desiring a separate treaty for this object, the negotiation finaUy fell through.
			A steamer had exploded on the Ocmulgee river, and killed eight negroes and five whites.
			Governor Stewart had vetoed the Missouri Free Negro Bill. The death of Governor Bissell, of Illi- nois, is reported.
			Overland advices from California are to the 28th of February. A well-known citizen of San Fran- cisco is stated to have paid $35,000 for a claim ex- tending over only 60 feet, at the Washoo gold mine, where the excitement continued unabated.
			The advices from Oregon are to the 28th of Jan- uary. An atrocious massacre of defenceless Indians was perpetrated by a band of 40 white men, on the 26th. It was estimated that200 had beenkilled, and the only reason given was that they were suspected of having furnished the warlike Indians in the mountains with arms.
			At New Orleans advices had been receivel from IHavannah to the 15th ult. Sugar was dull at 9 reals. Exchange on New York, 2j per cent.
			Advices from MIexico are highly important, the Star of the West having arrived at Nevw Orleans with papers which had been forwarded to Washing- ton, giving an account of the seizure of Vera Cruz by M1iramon. These advices state that-
			" Miramon approached Vera Craz on the 29th of Feb- rnary, with 5,000 men, a numerous train of artilery, and ammnunition stores, and encamped four miles from the city. The kead-quarters were at Medellin. Mrmon several times surveyed the city from the sand hiUls. His principal generals ae Robles and Negrete. AU tho inhabitants tied at his approach. The city was in the best state of defence. The garrison vras composed of from 3,000 to 4,000 men, wUll supplied in every respect. General Iglesiss Is in com- mand, with Ampudia as chief o' the artlllery. Colonel Lane, an Englishman, commands the new samd fort, recently erected near that city, mounting siz 84-poneders. It was thought that this fort would be able to resist the approach of Miramon, if the men are faithful, on the 1Ith ult Colonel Vivaldo, who commanded one of the principal forts on the seothern side, was detected in a conspiracy to blow up the fort on Miramon's approach, and the latter was to enter the city on that side. Thirty conspirators were banished from the city, and Vivaldo condemned to four years' im- prisonment.
			" Mfarin's Havannah expedition raised the Mexican 'dag when out of Havannah harbour. It was last heard of at Sisal. As far as was known,the plan was to land on the coast at or near the mouth of Medellin River, and thence communicate wlth Miramon. Marin had on board a large quantity of ammunition, stores, and 12 24-pounders. It was belleved that several other vessels hade ailed from Havannah on the same mission. A wel-laden schooner was known to have sailed on the 16th.
			" Juarez is on the look out for this expedition. He has a battery planted at the mouth of MedeDin river. Six or seven schooner-rigged gunboats, mounting 64-pounders, were stationed along the coast to interceptit. The Indlanola was to tow ganboats to action. Goicouria was aboard the Indianola.
			"The Savannab, Saratoga, and Preble were anehored un- der the inside walls of SanJuan D'UUloa, ready to actin anv emergency. English, French, and Spanish vessels were at Sacrificios.
			"The French commander and others visited Miramon's camp. The result of the interview was unknown. Captain Turnar, of the Saratoga, had gone to Miramon's camp in behalf of the American citizens.
			" The Liberals and Amer.can citizens were urging Captain Jaivis to captore Marin's expedition, which he had not de- cided to do when the Teviot sailed.
			" Lieutenant Carter, who had arrived at New Orleans wlth despatches for Washington, says that Vera Cruz was safe, but he thinks that Miramon wiloccupy Alvarado.
			" The Havannah Diarfo says that Mismon has from 6,000 to 8,000 men, wel supported with artilery.
			" NEW ORLEANS, MAnCI 19.
			"The steamer General Miramon is below, a p.ize to tho United States, in charge of Lieutenant Ainor, from Vera Cruz, 13th inst.
			"The city was besieged by Miramon.
			"On the 5th he notified the representatives of forelgn Governments of his intention to cannonade the city.
			" He made an attack in force on the night of the 7th, but was soon repulsed by the Liberals, who are confident of a suonessful resistance.
			" The United States' ship Preble was to sall for New Orleans on the 14th.
			"No particulars of the capture of the steamer General Miramon have yet been received.
			" SECOND DzSPA.rcs.
			"The Mexican war steamer Marquez has arrived below, a United States' prize, in charge of Lientenant Chapman, of the Saratoga.
			" The Saratoga's men also captmued the steamer Miramon, which arrived at noon.
			" Both steamers were captured off Anton Lizardo on the morning of the 6th inst., after a brief notion, and with only a slight loss.
			"The steamer Marquez has on board a portion of the prisoners taken, and the United States' ship Preble is to hring the remainder.
			"Alvarado is reported to be in Possession of Mramon.
			" The exequatur of the American Consul at Vera Cruz has been revoked.
			"The city of Mexico is surrounded by the Liberals.
			" TBIRD DESP.ATCH.
			"Great excitement existed at Vera Cruz in consequence of the action of the American squadron.
			"The French and Spanish residents were very bitter in their denunciations of the affair.
			"Lieutenant Chapman is bearer of despatches to Wash- ington. " NEW ORLEANS, MALRCH 20.
			- Miramon commenced the siege of Vera Cruz on the 5th inst. On the 6th two steamers appeared before the city, end refused to show their colours. Commander Jarvls, therefore, ordered the Saratoga, with a detashment from the Savannah, and Preble, in the steamers Indianola and Wave, to proceed to the anchorage and ascertain the cha- racter of the two strango steamers. As the Saratoga, towed by the Lndianola approached them, thegy ried to escape, hut were too late. Captain Turner then sent a beat with a flag to demand the nationalityof the steamers, wvhen the boat was fired upon twice;- whereupon the Sara- toga Sired a broadside into the Geeral Llramon, and the action became general.
			"Both steamers now hoisted the Spanish flag, and, after a spirited engagement, Mari surrendered, and he and most of his men wrere taken prisoners.
			"The American loss was three wounded, one mortly. The Mexcan loss is 15 killed, and 20 to 30 wounded."

It is there stated, that "Mr. Marling read an invitation he had given Mr. Hors- man to be present, and MIr. EHorsman's reply, deallning." It is due to Mr. Horsman to say, that the oniy communica- tion he received on the subject was aleter fromnMr.Marling, of which, end la. foreman's reply, I add copies, and yolu wil observe that ha.

			AfONBY-MA-RKETandCITYINTBLLIGENCE. I
			MONDAY EVErNOG.
			The English fands opened this morning at a fresh decline of an eighth, but a rally occurred in the tniddle of the day, and was maintained to the close.
			ie &amp;rt bargains in Consols for money were at 933 ;4D 94, and the last at 94k to i. The recovery was atributable to a slight improvement in the quota- Mons from Paris, coupled with a few speculative .7orchases. India Stock left off at 218 to 221 * India f?ive per Cents., 104i toI; Rupee Five per Cents., W7 to J; Five-and-a-hf per Cents., 103to i; ~India Bonds, 5s. discount to par ; and Exchequer- 1blls, 14s. to 18s. premium.
			The demaud for money in the general market to-day has not been so active as during the past ,week, but is still heavy, partly in anticipation of the 4th of the month. At the Bauk the applications for discount have been on an undiminished scale.
			There haa been rather more business in foreign Etocks, and in several cazes a better tendency was shown. Turkish Six per Cents. have Improved to '78i to old, and 60i to J new. The scrip of the .&amp;ew Braziian Loan was dealt in at 1A}, 0j, and J discount, aud left off 1i to 0 dlscount.
			Iexican, on the newa of the capture of Moiramn's steamers, advanced to 21 to J. Chilian aix per Cents. were negotiated at 102 es div.; X-encan, for the account, 20i, j, 21 and ; Peru- vian Three per Cents., 692 ex drv., br the account ?Z1 and 70; Portoguese, 43; Russian Five per Cents., ;1OS and 107k; Four-and-a-lf per Cents., 96i and S6; Three per Cents., 64 and 64; Sardinian, 83k;
			;panisb, for the account, 45 and 46; Deferred, for .khe account, 34i, 35, and Pasive, 14 and B;
			iTarkish Sx e
			tTrdhSxper Cents., for the account, 7Sf; New
			2Lan, for the account, 60k and-i; Four per Cents. PGuaranteed, 101; and Dutch Your per Cent. Certi- &gt;ficatea, 9!9 ex div.
			The settling day in the New Brazilian Scrip is .appointed for Thursday.
			The closing price from Paris this afternoon for Athe account in course of liquidation was 69f. 20c., Sahowing a fractional improvement. For the end of April the quotation was 69f. 30c.
			The corn-market this morning was steady at the improvement of last week.
			There were no bullion operations of any impor- tance at the Bank to-day.
			The steamer with the outward India and China mails on Weeduesday will take 122,4581., of which 69,3131. (14,4731. in gold and 54,840/. in silver) is ,for India and Ceylon, and 53,146!., all silver, is for China. The whole is on private account.
			The present month does not promise to maintain .the reputation of April as regards the price of Con- tols. During a period of 62 years Consols have only upon one occasion touched in this month the aowe5t point of the year, while in eight inatances Utey have been higher than in any of the other anonthz. Now, however, the price is 2 per cent. lbelow that at which tho year opened, or 21 percent. Freckoning the three months' dividend which has ~ncrued. The advance in the Bank rate of discount nrom21 to 4k per cent. has been a main cause of the Mbeaviness, since, although the turn in politics has 3ust S~een unfavourable, this turn is rather a revul-
			ion fror^ the anticipations excited by the French t-reaty&gt;, of which nothing was known till February, than from any confidence entertained in the prospect of our relations with France on the 1st of January !In that respect we are pretty nearly as ve ewerer. But although the Bank rate has been almost doubled ;within the three months, the diminution in ,Vhe-stock of bullion is not very serious, the faling off having been less than 1,200,0001., a movement wiich, under ordinary circumstances, usuaUy leads jto an alteration of not more than a-half, or, at the rntmost, ono per cent. in the Bank charge. The and- deannezsa of the drain caused by the demand for the )Iupee Stocks was a principal motive for the strong measures first adopted, and subsequently the extra- ,ordinary pressure consequent upon the increased magnitude of the funds temporarily locked up by our mevenue payments has given the Bank the power to ,demrnd a further increase. The drain in con- :nexion with the Rupee Stocks is nearly at an end, fnd the quarterly disbursements of the Govern- ment and the payment of the dividends will soon meetthe other difficulty. The prospect of a return .to comparative ease or of a continuance of pres- sure must then depend upon the fluctuations in the ibullion. Supposing moderate amounts to be re- ceived from America, and a fair average supply from Australia, there seems no reason to apprebend that the arrivals will not be adequate to meet the export demand, especiaUy as the present high rate of interest is calculated to check the flow of capital hence, and to attract it hither from other quarters.
			Certain points on which it was thought the new Bankruptcy Bill would require alteration were mentioned in Thc Tirnes of Monday last. The 3lercantile Law Amendment Society have since been In communication with the Attorney-GeneraL andit
			appears that the modillcations in question will be effected. The provisions making the seizure and sale 'ef a debtor's goods under an execution an act of bankruptcy from the date of seizure are to be Sollowed by a proviso that a petition for adjudica- tion shall be presented within a month of the sale. The clauses making the non-payment of a bill of mxchange by the acceptor after a 12 days' notice ;an act of baukruptcy are to be struck out, as ;both useless and inconvenient. Power is to be given to the iudge and commissioners to issue a summons calling upon a debtor to show cause why he should not be adjudged bankrupt in cases where the creditor makes an affidavit that a debt suffi- �!ent to sustain an adjudication is due, and that he verily believes that his debtor is in insolvent cir- cumBtances, and disclosing his reasons for that belief. After the summons has issued, however, the creditor is not to receive payment of his debt until the debtor has been examined and has siatisfied the Court of his ability to meet his engagements with his creditors. The majority competent to bind a minority in cases of trust deeds or private arrangements Is to be a Gimple majori'y in number, representing three- fourths in value, instead of three-fourths both in number and value. The debtor in cases of trust deeds is to have 14 days instead of seven to get the required majority of his creditors to assent. 'rovision is also to be made for the punishment of debtors vexatiously defending actions brought against them.

			THB CORN TRADE.
			MAIRK-LANE, MONDAY AyramO ro, AIRIL 2.
			The arrivals of grain l_st week were again very short. The exports wero only 103 cwt. of flour. Of British wheat there were 6,318 qrs., of foreign 731 qrs. The momings arrivsls from Kent and Essex were below an avenge. Englsh Eamples of good quality went off slowly at the prices of last week, but those out of condition were very dulL The trade in foreign vas unaltered. Of country flour the supply was 18,326 sacks, of foreIgn 73 sacks 169 barrels. The business In Norfolks was very quiet at about s. over the rates of Monday lWst. American barrels were not so ready sale. Town prices were unchanged. The sup- ply of British barley amounted zo 2,101 qrs., the foreign to 1,540 qrs. The repeated short supplies having greatly re- duced etocks, al descriptions from malting to grinding sold at ls. per qr. advance. In malt the trade was uncommonly dull, the advance in barley not having the sllghtest Influence on prlces. The entire supply of oats was only 4,423 qrs.- vl., 2,020 qrs. English, 63 qre, Scof.ch, 750 qrs. Irish, and 1,590 qr. foreign. Business was again only retail in its character, but needy buyers had to pay full prices for chokce lots in granary. Of native beans there were 1,049 qrs., of foreign 630 qrs. There was rather mors doing in good Englih qualUties at full prlces, forelgn being also firm. The supply of English peas was 288 qrs, with 75 qrs. fo- reign. The trade was limited in all sorts at fuly former rates. Of linseed there were 12,665 qrs., with 1,190 qrs. exported. Wlthout being lower linseed was less active, but cake remained a very ready asale at quite as much money. In the seed trade there was but lttle doing, the wet state of the land still postponing business, and to force sales oi cloverseed or trefoil would have brought lower rates, bht there was no disposition that way. Tares were In limited de- mand at former rates.' Canary difScult to quit. Other seeds much as last quoted.

			TIl FEN'HSiE i' HECOBEtOALTRItATY.- Every day the French Government shifts its ground on the rag question. At first it promised, as a concession to Eng- land, that the prohibition epet rasfrom France should be taken off; then it iby giving the papermakera hransuacettscha he.avy duty on exports should be Imposed as wol edrthe pur- chase of raps for export impossible; andwtith last few diays, in answer to adeputation of bokelran,pb lishers, complaining that if the rag-marktb honoe
			paper wil become dearer, the MiniseofCm rc and Agiculture has declaredthat, "beforem
			sion to the English," he will enter intneoiinswh neighbouring States for the purpose of seegifsmgnra system of duties on the export of rags cno eaotd When these negotiations wi ena
			but the Minister himself told the deputto htte r
			not at all likely to be completed. in timetenbeBilo be presented to the Ilegislative Bey inthe course of the present session. This means, I Imagine, that nothing Is to be done this year, at all events. Even if a Bill should. e present-ed to the Legislature, itisnotat al certain that it will pass, Inasmucli as the Protectionist and Prohi- bitionist fraternity in that body, smar-ting at the tresty with England, will naturally ho bhostile to any Utaiff refornis the Government may propose. It Is a great pity that the negotiators of the trea'y sliould have entirely neglected to deal with an article of so much importance as rags. If they had been more careful, the prohibition to export rags would at this moment, from the ratification of the treaty, have ceased to exist. The discumsions of the Council of State, In presence of the Emperor, on the propesed modifications of the duty on sugar, coffee, eocoa, and tea having been con- cluded the Bil prepared'has bee'n presented to the Legis- latie ilay Thi BIl,iesnta poinats, Is the same as the table commnunicated in my letter in the &amp;Ecnomsist of the 17th ; but it makes these changes :-As regards sugar, it preposes that inferior qualies may be admitted at lower
			duties, according to their quantity of saccharine matter. The Government Is to create a "sub-type" for such qualities, and, in the meantime, they are to pay the name duties as sugars of the first "typo," More- over, with respect to native and colonial refinecl sugar, the Bill proposes that it shall pay, not, as at first intended, 10 per centCadded to the duties on raw susar, but 5f. mere than these duties per 100 kllogrammes. The drawback- to be allowed on refined sugar exported is to be calculated. henceferth at the rate o 0ad 83 kdlogrammes (according to quality) per 100 k-ilogrammes raw, instead of 75 kflo. gramimes per 100 as heretofore ; In othr words, to get back, the duty paia onIODkilogrammes raw, refiners must send out SO or 83klilograzmnesof re6ned. The Bill issilent as tothe import of foreign refined sugar. Wisth regard to coffese the Bill m-akes a. slight modification ; it is, that coffee from the French colonies in Western Africa shall payr 30f. the 100 k-ilogrammes, the rate fixed for that of other co onles, instead of 35f. as at first proposed. Refiners are protesting against the change with which they are threatened ; but it is to be
			hpdthat no heed will he paid t-o them. Some persons are maig lugubrious calculations as to the loss which the -re- ductions will cause to the revenue, but the increase of cont- sumption which will take place cannot fall in a fewv years to cause that loss to he recovered; and, besides, the increase In consumption wil have the effect of aiding powerfully in the accomplishment of an object which the rFnch consider as of national importance-the development of merchant shipping as a nursery for semen for the Imperia navy.- Economist,

			The firminess of Consols has acted favourably upon the railway-market, several of the heavier stOCks cloSing at an advance. Great Northern, however, was flat. Only a moderate amount of business has taken _lace to-day. At 4 o'cloc' Lon- don and North-Western vas quoted 97&amp; to 98i; Mlidland, 115k to . Lancashire and Yorlahire, 1014 to ; Great WVestern, 671 to 68 ; South- Eastern, 874 to j; Great Northern, 1104 to lll; ditto, A stock, 112 to 114; CaledoniAn, 89Q to 90; and Eastern Counties, 54i to 55. Indian guaranteed stocks have been rather dull, but Canadiafi are again firmer. Grand Trunk closed at 34 to A, and Great Western of Canada, 13 to 4. There have been few ttansactions In the foreign market, and some of the smaller ndertakings exhibit an adverse tendency. San Paulo left off i to i discount4 and Lombardo-Vone- tian 14 pm. The proposed dividend of the latter for the year 1859 is 22E francs per share, with a re- merve of 220,0001. In-American railway securities an improvement occurred in the bonds and ahares of the Illinois Central, Michigan Southern bonds, and New York Central shares. Mines have been heavy, except St. John del Rey, in which a further rise has taken place. The shares of the Bank of Australasia have again rallied.

			The OaAnrAecr, in moving the adoption of the repDrt, ,tated the Bill for the extension of the line to Wells came before the House of Commons unopposed, and thero was reason to believe it would pass through the House of Lords withoutoencountering any objection. The money for carry- ing out thie line had been sabsribed before going to Parlia- ment, and as soon as the Bill received the Royal assentactive operationa woald be immediately commenced.
			Mr. BERRYsAwscconded the motion, which was carrled unanimously.
			The retiring directors and auditor wore re-eected.
			Mr B. E. CLERK congratulated the shareholders on their improved prospects. By the opening of thb lirie the trade of Shepton-Mallet had been considerably augmented, the value of property had increased, and the markets were re. gaining their old position. The traffic receipts averaged 7t. per mile per week, and, though at present this was all abosorbued by the working erpenses, he had it on good autho- rity that when the extension t Wells was completed the:e would be a fair prospect of a good dividend.
			The meetine was then made special, end the Bill for the extension to Wells was approved.
			A vote of thanks ho the chairman tormuina'ed the pro. ceapdin's.

			A lie surups? was a solicitor, of Lincoln's-Inn. This was au examination meeting.
			3ir. LWRA&amp;Nc, for the assignees, asked for an adjourn- ment sine die, with proteedon for a limited period. The banirapt had been engaged in the urepartion of his an- mounts; but, owing to some obstacles,includlng the hooks of the partnership being in the hands of Mr. Smart, the solvent Partner, they were not ready. The bankrupt had rendered accounts to several cltents.
			The Co sstoNwn-Are there any individual creditors pmreent who may wish to opoee the course suggested ?
			5. L&amp;WNAc.-ir. Abraham represents an inli- urdual creditor for a large amount, and he considers that an adjournment zinc die, vith limited protection, will be the best course.
			The CoeanssboNxLn said there were a great many cir- eumstances in the case which would give rise to inquiry. He would suggest that the assignees should not lose sight of their duty to bring any transaction that was wrong fUlly before the public. They had a case the other day-that of George MIontagn Evans,-in vwhich the trade assiguees lookingonly to pecuniary results, recommended theba3k sept for a certificate. That couse threw upon individual creditors the onus of bringing the conduct of the bankrupt aider the notice of the Court, and of showing that hevwas wvholly undeserving of a certificate. The assignees in the case now before the Court would, he trusted, do their duty.
			Mr. L&amp;WRANSO said he quite concurred in the observa- tions of the learned CommIssIoner. The time would arrive 'when al the circumstances in the case could be brought fuly before the Court. The assignees would not shrink from the discharge of any part of their duty.
			The CoaXssoMn.- Take an adjournment, as asked.

			CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, ApriA 2.
			The April sessions of the Central Crlminal Court was opened this morning before the Right Hon. John Carter, lord MIayor of the city of London; Thomas Chambers, Zso., the Common Serjeant; Alderman Lawrence, Aldermn Hale,and Alderman Condor, Mr. Aldeman and Sberiff Phillips, Mr. Alderman and Sheriff Gabriel, the Under- SherLils, &amp;c.
			It appears by the frst edition of the calendar that there are 113 prisoners for trial at this session. Of this number 27 are committed from the city of London, 54 from Middle- sex, 4 from Essex, 17 from Kent, and U from the county of Sarrey.
			The CommoN StRgsss vTr, at the commencement of his
			charge to the grand jury, observed, that efforts had been msde to relieve the grand jury from the duty of attending this Court, and a liii was at present before Parliament for the purposo of effecting that object. A good many argu- uents, ho said, might undoubtedly be used in favour of such a change, hut he had not yet come to the con- elusion that it w,as advisable to effect so great an altera- tion in the administration of justice in this country. Under the present syetem the stream of justice fowed through the people themselves, as it were, totaly in- deDendeat of professional or offiCal inflence, and this undoubtedly tended to create that confidence which was felt In this country, more than, perhaps, any other in the world, In the administration of the law, and a change ought not, in his opinion, to be effected in that system without very mature consideration. The learned Common Serjeant then proceeded to say that the duties of the grand jury on the present occasion would not be very onerous, for, although the calendar contained the names of a good many p"risoners, it won not greater than wonld have been expected from the period that had elapsed eince the last session ; and les was happy to inform them that it only contained two cases involving the destruction of human life, and these wonld not assume the aggravated form of charges of wilful murder, but the lesser offence of manslaughter. The first of these cases was a charge against the driver Ot a Hansom sab, who was charged with cansing tho death of a very aged person by driving over her. It appeared that he was in Princes-street with his cab, and it wo snowing heavily at tShe time, and the deceosed,'who was croesing the road, was carrying an umbrella, and she was knocked down and re- coked injuries of which she died. There was some doubt, upon the evidence, whether the prisoner called out or not, and the grand jury would have to say whether such criminal negligence was established against tho prisoner as would justify them in finding a trne bill, In the other caso It appeared that two lads, whose ages he could not state to them, because they were on bail and their names were not in the calendar, were each ridlng a pony in the public road, and they were racing, and a child who was crossing the road was run over and killed. In this case it was his duty to inform them that the act of racing in the public thoroug^hfare wan undoubtedly an illegal act, and if the grand jury should ho of opinion that the parties accused had lost the proper control over the animals throu their own act, and that the death of the child was the consequence of their negligence, it would be their duty to return a true bill. There was a case of assault of a felo- nious character upon a married woman, in which it was alleged that the prisoner, previous to the commission of the act imputed to hlm, had administered a drug to the prosecun- trix, which had the effebt of depriving her to some extent of her senses, and that while she was in thin state the offence was committed. If this should bo proved in law it would render the party accused equaily guilty as though he had effected his object by force. There also appeared to be a very long case of conspiracy, in which some foreigners were charged woth obtalning a large sum of money by false pretences and lies of varou kinds, but it did not appear to him to be ne- cessary for him to go into the particulars, as the grand jury were quito competent to deal with the case without any assistance from him.
			William Stunt, 37, a respectable-looking man, pleaded Guilty" to a charge of misdemeanour In obtaning money by falkepretences. There wan also a charge of felony against
			Mr. SLr.Gse, who was instructed with hIr. Poland to conduct the prosecution, said that Messrs. Nicoll, the mer- cbant taiors of Regent-street, were the prosecutors, end the prisoner was in their service in a confidentHal capacity. It nppeaied that he had misappropriated between 601. and I I1., and the offence had been committed by means of fdlse entries in the books. Tho prisoner, however, had evinced his contritionbypleading "Guilty,"and theprosecu- ft's, therefore, did not feel that thoy were called upon to proceed with the charge of felony.
			Mr. MIzrcsLF , who appeared for the prisoner, addreesed the CoMrt in mitigation of punishment, and nrged the facts that he bad been eight years ia the service of the prosecu- tors, that he was exposed to great temptation by large sums of money passing through his hands, and that he had a wife and elght children, end thot ho had already been 14 weeks ingJEAYr postponed the Sunt untilm he5 bad hadanopportunityof readinrtg thte deposiions. vti

			The Coseo r ScuJocred sentencedStunt tobe maprtsoned for 18 months, and Brooks for sie months, both to he also subjected to hatd labour.
			John Yeo, the, pleaded "Gulth y" to two iudiftments chirging him with stealing various articles, the property of hIs m5ster, Charles William HuSSon,
			Mr. ROBISSON, who appeared for the prosecutcr, stated that the prosecutor earned en business in sewvgate street
			fnd the pisoner had been for some time in his service ndI had charge of the premises on Sundays He had a key that-
			it appeared that the key opened other rooms in the ware- house, snd the prisoner took the opporti dty thus afforded binsof taking away a great deal of property. The worst part of the case was tho the prisoner had written inside one of the ca p she had stolen " Presented to me by liss-," a^ yonno lady in the service of the prosecutor, his object ev:- dently belcg to make it app ear, in case of discovery, that Shis young lady wias the thief.
			The Cosrasoy SKRJEANT, In passing sentence, said tha' the conduct oi the prisoner in endeavouring to castens.a dlielon upon an innocent person was most diabolical, and he
			ordered him to be kept in pensi servitude for four years.

			POLICB.
			nsOstoRouaHG-smTw.--3fr. Thomas Roberts, of 14 New Ormond-street, Queen-square, builder, was sum- monedbyhMr. Charles Mayhew, district surveyor to the' parish of St. James, under the Metropolitan Building Act, 18th and 19th Victoria, cap. 122, for that he " did put up and erect a shop-front to the external wall of the house or building No. 4, St. James's-strset, which street is of a width greacer than 30 feet, and wthich said shop-front pro- jects more than 10 inches-to wi1;, 2 feet and 1 an inch, wherets the said shop-front should not project more than 10 inches, and the cornice thereof should nut project more than 18 inches."
			When the evidence had been glven Mr. Bsn;Gsc de- livered the following judgment:-In answer to tbis sum- mons, for anismproper projection from the front wall of a house, it has been satisfactoily proved that the work ob- jected to was the rebuilding of an external wall for the pur- pose of necessary repair of the structure, and that such repair did not affect the constructon of the external wall, inasmuch as the apertures for doors and vwindows were in the same poSition and of the same size as in the old wail, and the projection did not extend more than half an inch, and not at all beyond the projection from the old wall, covering, in fact, nearly as possible the same space. The work objected to falls therefore writhin the exception in the 9th section of the Metropolitan Betiding act, 18th and 19th Victoria, cap. 122, and tho snunnons haa not heon sustained, at all events toa greater extent than half aninch7 which, In strictness, ought to be planed off.

			WESTaIISSrER.- Robert Mason, a gentleman's servant, was charged with stealing a gold watch, the property of Mr. John Balgny, of 20, Chester-square.l
			The prisoner entered the prosecutor's service In May last, and left a few months afterwards. Shortly after his depar- ture in December the watch Mr. Balgoy was wearing having stopped he went to a drawer in his dresming-room for another gold wateh, which he had deposited there in the April or May preceding, and found it gone. Information was given of the robbery, and Mr. Benjamin Fearne, in. spector of the Derby police, in censequence of a comminica- tion made to him, took the prisoner on Friday evening at Derby npon a charge of stealing the watc, a,nd on search- lag him found the ticket relating to it in hls pocket, when the prisoner admitted his guilt.

			WWORSm'-STREETs.-Wflhlam Fossey, a respectable-look- ing man, vwas finally examined on a complication of charges.
			The prisoner has been remanded for a good many weeks, and the substance of the cases against him was this:-In November last the prisoner took a house in Old-street-road, ostensibly as a house and estate agency office, and where he engaged three or four young men as clerks, requiring a deposit of several pounds from each, representing that he had several other establishments, a building-yard at Kings- land, the leases of 70 houses, and that his father had died bequeathing him 36 freehold houses more, tho rents of which theso clerks would have to collect, and, in addition to a weekly salary, would receive a commission for so doing. A very short time afterwards a young woman caUed at the house an,d claimed the prisoner as her husband, and this, as Mr. Beard said, made a case of bigamy ag^aist the prisoner, who had since married a maiden lady 53 years of age, and the owner of several leasehold houses. Neither of the wives, however, would come forward in support of this charge, which Mr. Beard was obliged to forego after stating It, but the consequence of this unpleasant claim was that the clerks suddenly found themselves without an em- ployer and without their money, the shutters of the house up, and the prisoner gone to Ormsby-street, Kiugsland. There they traced him, and extracted a promise of payment in a month, but before the month was up tho prisoner had gone again, this time to Mansfield-street, ings- land; and, as the clerks now found that the prisoner had no other offices, no leasehold or freehold houses, no workmen or building-yard, and that his father was still alive, they determined to give him into custody, and on the 26th of February Short, of theb G division, and Sergeant Evans went early in the morning to Mansfield- street, and on being admitted by a lodger Short went through into a yard at the rear, while Evans knocL-ed at the back parlour door, and asked to see Mr. Fossey. Before there was time for an interview, however, Short, in the yard, saw the prisoner throw up his bedroom window, leap on to the roof of a shed, with only his shirt and trousers on, and attempt to leap dowrn on the opposite side. Short pur- sued him over Eeveral walls, til they reached the roof of another shed, when Short made a grasp at the prisoner, and both rolled on to the roof, which gave way under their weight, and they dropped upon and injured a great number of fowls. The prisoner got out first, and was quiekly followed by Short and Evans; but it was only after a severe struggle between them that he was at length overpowered and secured. One wharfkeeper at the Ciy- road Basin deposed to the prisoner obtaining from him a quantity of building materials under false pretences; a houseowner doepsed to the prisoner taking a house of him, and stripping the roof of both that and the next house of all their lead and lead fittings; and now Mr. Saunders, a surveyor of Oxford-street, appeared, and proved letting to the prisoner one of his houses in Chapel-street,
			Islington,ln December last, but that ina fewA dysafte his taking possession of it ha found It vacated, and that SOCib. weight of lead had been stripped from the roof and aSntener of the house.
			The prisoner wished to make It appear that in this case he had taken the house upon an agreement for a loose for 21 years, but hMr. Saunders denied the truth of the assertion; andi
			Mr. MANSyTELD comMitted the prisoner for trisa upon several of the more serious charges.

			(BdforcAHr. JugiccWIGMuni andSpceW JurlO.)
			Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Garth were for the plaintiff; Mr. Lush, Q.0., cu d Mr. Wornum were for the defendant.
			This was an nction brought against tho defendant, es tho repreaentative of the Portuguese Government,- to re- cover the sum of 3,500. for spsrs, masts, sails, and other articles supplied to the steamship Donna Maria Ana, whiah had been built by the plaintiff, and equipped for tho Portuguese Government under a con- tract for 10,4001. The contract provided for penalties if the eshp was not completed by a paricular day, and extrs were to be paid for, if made under the orders in writing of Sir Georgo Sartorius. The plaintiff claimed for extra masts and sails and other rigging, and the dbfendant contended that he was bound to supply those articles under the contract, and further that there was a large claim as a set-off for penalties for delay in detaining the ship.
			The learned JuDGE said it appeared to him that there were several queelons of law upon the construction of the agreement as to the various classes of claim, and that tho details were simply a matter of account; and accordingly directed that the questions on the coustruction of the con- tract should be left to the Court, and then, if upon the result of that construction any matters of detail were con- sidered material, they should he referred, leave being then given to the defendant to move the Court on the constrac- tion of the agreement.
			A verdict was then taken for tho plaintiff-Damages 13,500., subject to the terms above stated.

			The plaintiff was a dealer in coal and coko, &amp;c. at R.ound- oak, in Worcestershire, and he sued the defendants to re-

It appeared that through some mistake, the truck had been delivered at the Vauxall station, Birmlngham, on the London and North- Western Iine, two miles from Snow-hDIl. The plaintiff having heard of the non-delivery made inquiry, but did net hear where the truck was till the 10th of January last, when he had to pay 41. to the London and North-Western Ril- way Company for siding roon," and 41. for the expensesof its removal, which, together with thesof 30s. erwek, which the plaintiff alleged the truck woul aeere,h

			This was an action for the breach of an agreement to plant fruit and other trees in a market-garden at Prestbuoy, near Cheltenham, and for not cultivating tho same in a tenant-like manner. The defendant paid 201. into court, and pleaded that the plaintiff had sustained no fuLrther damage.
			It appeared that, instead of cultivating the land as a market-garden and planting the required nnmber of gooso- berry and currant bushes, the defendant had ploughed up the land, and sown it with wheat.
			On the other hand, the defendant swore that he had planted the required number of frait trees, and left the land in an improved state.

			At the sitting of the Court this day the three prisoners were brought up to receive sentence.
			Mr. Justice KEATsiG, in passing sentence, said the pri- soners had been guilty of stealing property contained in letters which came into their hands as servants of the Post- offlEe. The offence was a most serious one, and might sub. isect them to a sentence of penal servitude for hfe, for the law very properly conddered that letters so received ought to be held sacred. As far as he (Mr. Justice Keating) was aware, these were the first offences whioh the prisoners had committed, but at the same time he could not conceal from himself the fact that the test letters which led to their detetilon in each case had been sent in consequence of coarpacnts wahch had been made of defaleation. Ono of the prisoners had received a good character, and no doubt the other twto prisoners mlght ~have had the same, for, hut for such characters, they would not have obtained employ. meet in the Post-office. In cases like these, howeover, charaster wa's of laSS consequences for it appoared the pri- soners had emnployed their good characters to abuse the trust reposed in them. The sentence was that each of the prlsoners be kept four years In penal servitude.

			_ COROI U'S INQUISITION AIMq D[EOSO OIS.
			ir appearea in tne above case that the coroner had not retunned tho uLsiti6n and depbsitionstaken before him.
			Mor. Justic3 TnT1G remarked on this breach of duty. on the part of the coroner's deputy who had held the Inqui- sition. The coroner, however, was liable for the neglect of
			his deputy, and his lordship imposed upon him a fine. of 51.
			John Danbeney Hlind was charged vrith feloniously uslng a certain lnstrument called a stiletto on. the -body of Mary Woolford, with intent to procure abortion,on the 16th of Ja3nuary, IS60, at Stroud.
			Mr. Carrington appeared for the proseoution; Mr. HTenry James defended the prisoner.
			It appeared that a woman, 39 yes of age, named Mary Woolford, was living In the service of Mr. Alexander, a inagistrate, residing at Highworth, in the county of Wilts. On Monday, the 16th of January last, she obtained leave to go to Bath; but there was reasonx to believe that, instead of going there, she went to the house of the prisoner, who was An old man, who appeared to practise maidwifery, at Stroud. She returned on the Friday following, and on Sunday, the 22d, she complained of illness, and. a surgeon was sent for to attend her. She complained of a chill, and died on the Wednesday night of natural causes. On the same day (Wednesday), in consequence of information which he reeived, Haines, the snpertntendent of Pbllco at Swindon, went to the prisoner's house it Stroud, at 12 o'clock at night, and took hlm Into custody upon a charge of nsing instruments upon Mary Woolford for the purpose of procuring abortion. The prisoner asked how the police- man knew, anLd what was the resuit, afd the policeman replied that the result was that probably the woman would die. He osarched the house, and found several instruments, two of which he brought away the next day-viz., a perforator and a blunt-pointed instrument, about nine inches n length. The prisoner's wife said sbe used the latter for her stays. The prisoner was taken the same night to Stroud, and in the morning the intelligence came that the woman was dead. The prisoner, when told of this, said, " Indeed," asd on the next Sunday he sent for the superintendent to consult him as to his defence, and In thecoarse of conversation said the deceased had behaved very ungratefaUy, that " a char- woman had paid all we charged, but It was not enough, con- sidering the risk we ran." Evidence was then given of a dying declaration made by the deceased woman on the Wednesday aftornoon, a few aoors before her death. She had been told by the surgeon in the morn- ing that she was in a very dangeroas state, and the chances were that she would not live; and in the after- noon, as she got worse, she told' her nurse that she was sure that she Ehould die, and wvished the surgeon to be sent for to take her confession. The surgeon came at 3 in the afternoon, and found her sinking, and the deceased said to him she mst. Confess, and could not keep it any longer. The deceased said she was advised to go to the pri- soner at Stroud, and that she went there on Monday, and it was done on Wednesday; tho prisoner first used his instrument on Monday, and the child was born on the Wednesday. She left on the Friday, though prisoner wished her to remain till the Monday. The same night she said to the sm-geon that from what she could see of the child it was a good-sized one, and that the prisoner kept It. The deceased hid made a similar confession to the nurse, and added that ladies used to go to the prisoner in their carriages and that the prisoner got his bread by it. She died at 11 o'ciock the same night. On cross-examination the sargeon said that there were cases when It was necessary with a view to the safety of the mother to procure abor- tion, but the instrument produced was not one which a sur- geon would use for that purpose, though it might be so used. On a post mortem examination it appeared beyond a doubt that the deceased had miscarried, but there were no finjuries on her person to show that any instrument had been used.
			Mr. JAsnrs addressed the jury for the prisoner, and con- tended that nothin7 said by the policeman flaes ought to be reled npon. The whole case, therefore, rested upon the declaration made by the deceased at a time when she was sinking and when, probably, her muemory was failing. There wvas no Impropriety in the deceased going to the prisoner's house to be confined; and he contended there was nething to show that the instrument had been improperly used.
			Mlr. Justice KErATNG summed up the evidenco, and left it to the jury to say whether they were satisfied upon the evidence thst the prisoner hacd used the Instrumeni for the purpose alleged.
			The jury found the prisoner GuClty, but recommended him to mercy on account of his age.
			Mr. Justice KEATING, in passing sentence, said it was a painful duty to pass sentence upon a person of the prisoner's age; but there was toD much reason to fear that this was not the prisoner's first offence, and the least sentence he could pass was that he be kept in penal servitude for six years.
			In the eourse of the trial the prisoner's counsel had taken an objection that the dying declaration could not properly be received in evidence, upon the ground that such declara- tions were only admissible when the cause of death was in queslion.
			Mr. Justice KtE&amp;TIG now said he should reserve that question for the Court of Criminal Appeal, and, in the meantime, suspend the execution of the sentence. The pri- soner would however, remain in custody.
			Daring this tria also the court was crowded vwith women, one-half of the gallery being set apart for their accommo- dation.
			Eenry Drew, a farmer, surrendered to take his trial upon a charge of stealing 12 brleks, some hoards, and a bit of iron pipe the property of his late landlord, Edmund Probyn, on the 21st of March, at Huntley.
			Mir. Guise appeared for the prosecution; Mr. HL James defended the-prlsoner.
			It appeared the prisoner had been for 30 years tenant of a farm belonging to the prosecutor, and, having given notice to leave he cleared out all his goods nnd chattels, and among the rest he or his men.had taken away a few bricks, some planks, and a bit of iron pipe, which were claimed by tho prosecutor. The bricks were taken openly by the prl- soner to steady some cider casks which were being removed but how, or.by whom, the other things came to be removed did not clearly appear.
			The prosecution was conducted with great warmth and eagernes, and the defence with no less an amount of ardour. The prosecutor, Mr. Probyn, who was sitting onthe bench, interrupted the prisoner's counsel in his address to the jury, and
			AMr. Justice ExATRsG, with much warmth, condemned the interruption, and threatened the prosecutor, who was a county magistrate, that if he interrupted again he would commit him.
			The jury found the prisoner Not GuiCCy.

			UIVIL CUUT.-(Before Mr. Baron BRAIrWiLL and

			WOOLLASTON V. N.WSON.
			Mr. Serjeant Pigott, Mr. Phipson, aud Mr. Fallon ap- Peared for the plaintiff; Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., and Mr. Scotland for the defendant.
			The plaintiff In this action, Dr. Woollston, wras a phy- siclan, practising at Cheltenham, and he sued the defendant, Dr. Hewson, a physician and surgeon, practising In the same town, to recover damages for a false representation as to the patients, &amp;o., to whom he had undertaden to introduce the plaintlff. It appeared the defendant had for somo years prac. tised at Cheltenham as a generalpractitioner, and on thel5th of September, 1858, an agreement was entered into between the parties, whereby the defendant agreed to surrender his pra�tice to the plaintiff on certain terms, The plaintiff was to pay the defendant 5001., for which he was to have the defendant's furniture and book debts, and the defendant was to introduce the platntiff to all his patients, a list of whom had been supplied. The plaintiff entered on his practice on the 15th of November, 185, but soon found that the defendant's practice was not of the leastvalue, the income for the first threeg months producing only 201. The book debts realized 1101., but the list of
			atentsgtrmned out to be wholly fallacious. The plaintiff then wished the defendant to cancel the agreement and retirn the 5001.; but, as the defendant declined to do this, the plaintiff gave up tho houee in June, 1859, and sold off the furniture. The sale realised 1501., and this, togethor with the book debts (11Ol.) and the produce of the business (201.) wasallthe plaintiff)hadreaUlized. Theplaintiff now sought to recover the difference between those sums and 5001., as damages for the false representation. The com- plaint he now made was, that many persons whose names were contained in the list faurnished by the defendant had never been the defendant's patients at all, and others had ceased to be so for years. It appered, however, on the cross-oxamination of tho p aintiff that soon after entering on tho practice ho succeeded in obtaining the appointment of physician to the Dispensary. It was one of the rules of the Dispensary that the phys1cian should not practise as a general practitioner, but only as a
			"pure physician," and the suggestion made on the pert of the defendant was, that having obtained that appointmeut, a new vista opened tothe plaintiff of Rraotice of a higher glass. In pursuit of this object he wished the defendant to take back his practice and refund the 5001.; but, as the defendant refused, he himself s3old off the old furniture, took a new house in Lansdowne, and now sought, as the learned baron observed, to make the de- feadat pay for his new furniture. It appfa that the plaintiff had caused a draught agreement to be prepared for CaneClling the original agreement, and in the dratoht so pre- pared there wa a rectal that each party had fu led the terms of his agreement. This was much relied upon by the de3enlaut as showing that there had really been no misre- presentation on the part of the defendant.
			The defendant was called, and denied that. he bad ever given the ulaintiff the list producd as a nlst jdea. It weas ftof th patients and friends,"

			OLTURDAL COURTB.-(Befor.: Mr. 3usHrc MR&amp;TING.1
			Joseph Webb, 21, servant, was charged with the wilful murder of John Hughes, a man aged 76, on thc 14th of 5anuary, 1880, at St. Briavel'rs, in the Forest of Deau.
			tlor DMavis and Mr.. Sswyer appeared for the prosen. tion ; hr. CrIops defened the prisoner.
			It appeared tho prisoner had been for about three months employed as an outdoor servaut of William Rear, a small farmer and cidershop.keeper at St. Briavel's, in the Forest of Dean. This was during the illness of theregulor servant, George Hughes, who reterned to his employment on the 4th of January last. George. Hughes. was asked to look at a sick calf, which was kept at a farm about 300 yards from the house, and the prisoner msde some objection to this, and became somewhat excited when Hughes went. The rsoner began to tease and pull the hair of his master's son, ichard Eear, a boy 13 years of age, and wben the boy called for assistance his 8randfather and one of his sisters succeeded, after some difficulty, in releaslng him from the grasp of the prisoner. In the scuffle the sister, a girl 19 years of age, struck the prisoner with a stick, upon which he knocked her down, then the grandfather, and then the deceased, John Hughes, who was the father of his fellow-servant, George Hughes. The boy went out and fetched a spade, and told the prisoner that, If he struck his grandfather Hear again, he prsorld hit him with the spade. The prisoner at once knocked old fHear down, upon which the boy lstrecl the prisoner with the spade, and ran away out of the honse. Being followed by the prlsoner, he dropped the spade and escaped. Old Eear kicked the spade, and, as he Isad, was about to throw it away, when the prisoner, who was a very powerful man, rushed upon him, wrenched tlhe spade ont of his hand, and knocked him down with his fist. The deceased, John Hughes, at this time came out of the house, and was crossing the yard, vwhen the prisoner, who was in a state bordering on fury, came behind him and struck him down with the spade. The old man's hat flew off, and while he was on the gronld the prisoner struck him seve- ral times on the bare head with the spade, and proceeded in a state of frenzy to attack several other persons with the spade, dislocating the shoulder of one, breaking the arm of another, and cutting open the head of a woman who heid a child in her arms.
			Mr. CRIPrS addressed the jury for the prisoner, contend- Ing that tho assaults made on the prisonerwith the stick and spade were sufficient to reduce the offence to man- slaughter only.
			The jury Acquittcd the prisoner of murder, and found him OuiGly of manslaughter.
			Mr. . ostice KEATING made some strong remarks on the atrocity of the prisoner's offence, and Eentenced him to penal servitude for life.

			Mrx. Collier and AfkiioIerldge were counsel for the plain- tiff; Mr. Butt, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Stone were counsel for the defendants.
			Mr. COLLIMu, in stating the case for the plaintiff, ob- served that this was one of those cases in which tho railway compny,whowerethedefndans, ereendeavouring to rui th orrirs y ersstig n acousewhich, according
			te th decsionof eery curt n totmintehain u tomte Eixchequer Chamber, had been held to be illegaL. He stated

			jury would express that as their opinion by the verdict they pronouLnoed.
			The cause proceeded for some vwy, when it was agreed to state a special case for the opinion of the Court, to decide the Point raised.
			In the case of Serafin Manzano, the Spaniard, who was tried at Devizes on Tuesday and Wednesday lsst for murder, end sentenced to death, Mr. COLE applied to Mr. Baron Miartin to reserve a point for the opinion of the Conrt for the Consideration of Orown Cases Reserved under the followlngcircunsstances :-The prlsoner was unable to speak English or to unsdestand it. The evi- dence was translated to the prisoner, but the finding of the jury was not, end, 'althoughE he was duly called upon by the officer of the Court to cay whether he had an-ything to, say why juLdgment of death should not be passed upon him, that was noo trans- lated to him, hut sentence of death was passed, and he had never had any opportunity of moving In arrest of judgmnent, which ho was entitled to under the statute of George lII. The learned counsel cited the case of the Brazlllpn Prisoners who were tried at Exeter, where 3Ir. Beron Plattbreserved a poinLt mnany days after the trial.
			Mr. Baron MA Ni said that in thAt case the application hadabeen first made at the tri and refused, which wria the distinction between that case and this. Here he had already signed the calendar, end hal no jurisdction to interfere if he had the inclinationx to do so, and his Lordsnlp expressed his opinon that the prisoner knew enough of English to understaud what was oWassiEr.

			Sneew JTurm,.)
			11RSB A!TD ANOTHEIE, ASSIGNTES, &amp;C., V. LEVY AND
			ANOTHER.
			Mr. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Wheeler were connsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Milward for the defendants.
			The plaintiffs are assignees of tho estate of Jame3 Mrciure, Jun., a bankrapt, and the defendants are Elian TLevy and Simeon Sampson, carrying on bubinessin partner- ship as "job and fent dealers" In Manchester. The action was in trover, and was brought to recover the value of a large quantity of g6oda alleged to have been fraudulently disposed of by the bankrupt to the deficdants.
			From the evidence of the bankrupt, who was caUed as a witness for the plaintiff, it appeared that in the month of August last he succeeded to the business of his uncle, Mr. M'Clure, having for some months praeloasly managed the same. He bought the business of hlb unclo for 600?, paying 2001. down and giving him four promissory notes for 1001. each. The goods which -were the sabject of thl action were obtained on credit at the invoica prlees of 7211. Ss. These goods he resold wlthin a few days In various parcels to the defendants, at prices, appearing by Invoices made out by him to them, about 20 per cent. less than the prices at which hebad bought them; but the sunm for which he reaUy sold to the defendants, and which ha actually received from them, were not above half tho prices at which he had bought the goods upon crodt. Other goads
			bought on credit hba also been disposed of by the bsnrpt at lees than ths- cos prce to other persons.
			For the defence it was contended that tho prices paid by the defendants were In truth the primes marked in the in- voices made out to them by the bankrupt, and were not unreasonable under the clhcumstances. It was also urged that the evidence of the bankrupt was mot credible, and that no complicity on the pat of the defendants was esta. bllshed. The defendants and other witnesses were called, who contradicted the bankrupt as to the prlce paid by the defendants for the goods.
			The trial of this cause commenced on Saturday, and was resumed this morning. It was still proceeding wvhen our despatch was made up.
			The Crown Court has been occupied to day in trjlng several cases of erinurv.

			Z-ITZAR AND NJA VIAL MTELIXGRNOB.
			The suihorites connected with the Ledlcal Dhpartment ,el the Army have, with the concurrence eo the Secretay o Etate!or War, dedded on estiblsbing l smatoriumnd invalld esablishment at the Cape of Good Hope for the re- Veptlon of the slck and d1sabled troops belonging to the nm5iou corp Eerving In China. This arrangement has been made by the Government In order to obviate the necessity of forw=rding the wounded and invalid troops over ibe long voyage to England. nlformation has been secdved at -the medical establshment, Chatham, that a number of medical officers Will bo required for the new establishment, and these will be despatched as early sa possble.
			A party of non-commisaicned officers and men of the 40th Regiment, to the number of 22 men of all ranks, have
			rrived at Fort Pitt Eospital, Chatham, from Australia, havlng been brought home In the hired troopahip Wellesley, 1,10 tons, Capt. J. Smith. The Wellesley sailed from
			delbourne on the 25th of December, the pasage occupying 99 days. During the voyage one man died on board, and one insane soldier Is supposed to have jumped overboard. Zost of the troops invalided home re sffering from ophthalmlx After the invalids had been inspected at Fort Pitt ten men were admitted into hospital, and the remainder 5ent to St. hlary's Invalid establlshment.
			At St. Helena, on the 10th of February, abrlgantine, name vnimown, arrived in charge of Mr. Hamilton, midshipman, Of the screw steam corvette Archer, 13, Capt. Richard *W. Comutensy. She wa seized off Lungo Bonda, January 30, when her crew were so reduced by fever that they asLed 'to be removed to the Archer for medical treatment. On the 13'th a bark captured by the paddlewheel steamvessel Prton, 3, Lieut.-Commsnder Robert H. Burton, was con- demned by the judge as a prize. When captured she had 453 male and 141 female negroes on board. When con- demned there were 39S men and 114 women: all the others died in the interim.
			About 150 men from the flagship Impregnable, in Ha- moaze, and an officer and 40 men belonging to the screw Vteamship Conqueror, 01, Capt. Sotheby, C.B., in Plr xaouth Sound, were sent on Sunday to assist the hired Government transport Havering, stranded on Batten Ridge. The paddlewheel steamtug Confiance and a lighter with -an anchor were also in attendance. Her yards 3nd topmasts have been sent down. When the Havering parted ler chains her topgallantyards were across; this is usual on board merchant ships in the Sound, although at the same time everything is made snug on board ships of war, and possibly steam is up to meet apparent contingencies. The -ifference in the comparative strength of the crews may account for the fact, but there is no doubt that less injury -would arise to merchant shipping If more precaution in this 5espect could be observed.
			The Siren, 16, sailing sloop, Commander G. ML Baifour, arrived at Spithead yesterday, shortly after noon, from -pernambuco, vhich port she left on the 1st of March. She brlngs home two naval engineers from Her Majesty's ships Buzzard and Oberon, who have been tried by court-martial on the station, and a few naval Invalids. Mr. Graves, late senior lient. of the Siren, has also come home a pri- zoner on board her. The Siren has been in commission four years and wlght mouths on the 8th Inst.; and during that time has been commanded successively by four different =fficers-Commander Otway, by whom she was commis- -doned; Acting Commander Buckle; Commander Selwyn, and her present commander, G. M. Balfour.
			The funeral of the late Commander James Hunt, of HIer MIajest3's troop steamer Megura, took place yesterday in the liurialground attached to the Royal MNaval Hospital at Kaslar. During the time the ceremony was taking place -tae men-of-war in Portsmouth harbour lowered their en- aigns to " half staff."
			Mfr. Grant, late paymasterof Her Mjesty's ship Britannia will be attached to the suite of his Royal Highness the Pzince of Wales during the forthcoming viait of his Royal Highness to Canada.
			Bear-Admiral Hon. F. T. Pelham, one of the Lords of the Admiralty, vlsited the dockyard at Portsmouth yesterday.
			The Bacchante, 51, screw steamer, at Portsmouth, is hourly expected to be commissioned by Capt. Mackenzie flate of Her Mfajesty's ship Excellent), for the flag of Rear Admiral of the White Sir Thomas Maitland, EO.B. T-ent. Trolloppe, it is reported, will be the Flag Lient.
			The Vlitoria and Albert, Royal paddle yacht, got up team yesterday In the steam basin, at Portsmouth, to test joints, &amp;c., on the completion of the fitting of her super- heating steam apparatus. She is expected to start to-morrow on a trip as far as Lisbon or Gibraltar, to give her super- bieatinz sear a full trial.
			The Vulture, 6, paddle, Capt. G. Parker, Is stripping at the middle harbour buoy In Portsmouth harbour, and rw tuning stores, b-c., In readiness for paying off.
			In the steam basin at Portsmouth the Victoria, 121, screw three-decker, Is complete in her engineering depart
			rent, and w{i get up steam In about sia or eight days. The Prince of Wales, 131, screw three-decker, has her boilers and screwvshafting in. The Duncan, 101, screw two-decker, has her engines and boilers In, and is having her coal bunkers built up. The Immortalit6, 51, screw frlgate, has :also her engines and boilers on board, and has only to add her coal bunkers before getting up steam, which she is ex- pected to do in about threo weeks' time. The Sutlej, 51, screw, has her boilers and screw-shafting in, and hands are employed completing the beds for the reception oi ber engines. The Welson, 91, screwv two-decker, has all her machinery on board, and Is expected to be ready for her screw trial about the 17th inst. The Rinaldo, 17, screw corvette, has her screw-shafting in and screw shipped, and wil commence talking dh board her boilers and machinery In a few days.
			The radne, 26, screw, Capt. B. W. Vansdttart, is awaiting orders at Spithead. On her recent cruise to the westward under canvass she experienced verystrong westerly and north-westerly breezes, reducing the canvass to close- reefed topsails and reefed courses. The ship behaved xremarkably well throughout the cruise; was always nnder perfect command of her helm; tacked beautifully in hieavy cross seas; was very easy, and gave every promise of being fast underher canvass. Three-fourths of the Ariadne's crew are for the first time serving On board a man-of-war.
			The foUowing appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :-Commander S. H. Henderson, to the Megaara; Charles R. Forrest, mate, to the Donegal; W. B. Wal- pole, naval cadet, to the Conqueror; Samuel HIarrson, pro- moted to the rank of second-class assist.-engineer In the ondon; William Smith, promoted to the rank of second- class azsist.-engineer in the Grappler; Allen Aitkin, pro- moted to the rank of second-class assist.-engineer, to the Melpomene; William Inglis (a), promoted to the rank of second-class assist.-engineer in the Hydra; James Jessop, promoted to the rank of second-class assist-engineer in the Magicienne; Hervey Benbow, promoted to the rank of acting second-class ass{st.-engineer in the Intrepid ; Wlliam HUenry Croxall, promoted and appointed second-class assist.- engineer, to the Asia, for charge of machinery of the Philo- mel; Thomas Willmott, acting third-class assist.-engineer, to the Fisgard, for service in the Widgeon.

			PURIFICAT7ON OF THE SBP.BNTINE.
			The select comrinTte appointed to conmider the best mean of effectually cleansing the Serpentine have cousidered the tuatters to tbenq Teferred and have agreed to the following report -
			" L The sheet of wster called the Serpentine was derived from the Banelagh-brook, which, after springing In thS ElIghgate.hillj ran along the BayswatervaUe through Kensington-gardens and H.Tde.park, under the ancient Knightsbridge, nto the Thpnes.
			" 2. The wats of this brook, havng been checked by the dam whch wzs thrwn across the lower end of the Seri Pentine In the reign of ing William IIL, flowed Into gravel nits sad ponds which were adjaceut to their channel, aindocapned tohelr presen area in 1730. As population in reazedinthedisitas through which the brook passed it lost Its character of a broo and became kiown as the Ranelagh Sewer. Its current had become so offensive in 1&amp;34: that an Act of Parliament was passed to divert It from the Serpentine through a covered channel, and sitne that period only the overflow, in heavy or continnous rains, has reached the Serpentine. This overflow Is the main cause of the complaints which have been made of the state of the Serpentine, and consttutes such a ounsanco as in our opinion ug Tthbeimediaoevybtedr Tha eenot ee sOf the Metropolitan Boar of Work inforedut�hat tfhne Board

			rcetiont fo E Ibrne mutirh6tuer es of allsssand fromta all0t the following causes :--The occaslonal admission of sewage, the contamination arising from putrefying mud, the deposit of soot and other impurities of the London atmosphere, the results of bathing, and the stagnation of the water.
			" 4. The only correctives heretofore applied to the evils arising from these impurities have been -the supply of a certain quantity of fresh water obtained ?rom springs In the lake itself, the rainfall andi water shed, andfromathe Chelsea Water Company. These, however, have not been sufficient either for removing obnoxious exhalations, or for clearing the water of conferwe and other vegetable productions ; and during the summer montha of 1858 and 1859 a quantity of quicklime was thrown Into the water, by which, for a time at least, the evils complained of were diminished.
			" 5. Several plans and estimates have been submitted to the Government for remedlying this evil condition. Sir John Rennie, In September, 1848, proposed to remove the mud, and to obtain a supply of fresh wvater from the water coin- panies, or frem the B rent or Verulamn; Mr. Mann proposed in November. 1848, to cover the mud with concrete In the manner which was subsMuently adopted with reard to St. James's Lake in 1857'. Messra. Easton and Amos, In De- cember, 1848, proposed also to cover the mud with concrete, and they submitted another project in April, 1S57, for sup- flying water to the Serpentine from a wel.l In Duck Island. a 1858 Mr. Page was instructed by the That Commissioner of Works to investigate the question, and In 1859 a plan was prepared by him which he stated would put the Serpentine into a cIean and sanitary condition, and maintain it in that state, and aleo render it less dangerous to bathers and skaters. This plan received the sanction of the Government, and wassubimittedby themto Parliament. Owing, however, to a change of Government before tho civil estimates were voted the opinion of Parliament was not taken upon it, ando Mr. Hawksley was requested, on the 7t f'?'1859 t rpr cee which he submitted
			5 of Yuly, and which was adopted by the First Comamisoner of Vrorks.
			"16. A sum of 1t7 0001 was voted by ParlIament for Its execntion, and tendfers w~ere acceptedl on the 25th of Novem- ber, 1859 ; and, although the workcs have made considerable progress, they are so yet Incomplete.
			"i167. This plan was Intended to purify the water by filtra. ton, wvithout deaiag with the mud, and without any in. crease In the suppl:r~ of fresh water. It aimed at remo7lan the fibrous Sliamnests of conferve, the navsiculse, and other lower orders of aquatic vegetation which occur In still water containing fr-ee ca-rbonic acid or bicarbonate of lime, and which produce a dis-agreeable appearance in the water.
			"8. This object was to be secured by causing the Serpen- tine to circulate timrough filter beeds of sand, so that a 30th part of its whole bulk might pas daily through the filter during the six hottsst months, a 60th during four of the colder months, leaving it at rest the remaining two months of the year.
			" 9. This plan was recommended for tts efficiency and economy, as enablinig a larger quantity of wr.ter to he purl. fled in this way than by any other means. But against this it has been urged thtat, In comparison with other schemes,its results will not be wiorth its cost - that the cleansing of filter beds close to public walks Is likdy to he offensive; that it will become unnecessary whenever a copious supply of water Is obtained, and ths.t the work-s necessary for its execution will ha prejudicial io the appearance of that portion of Kepsington-gardens: where they are situated.
			-- Iu. ainougn river water drank In towns Is commonly passed through filtels of sand on its wayto thehouses to whech it Is distributed, and although filtration is also used to purify water for some manufactures, yet no Instance has been mentioned to us of its having been employed for the pur- poose of keeping a large body of water in a permanent state Of purity; and we have received much evidence as to facts whlch might guide us in coming to a conclusion upon the porobabilties of success which may attend such an experi-
			"11. Theproposed filtration Is not stated to be such as can remove smpurittes held in solatlon; and, considering that the object in view is not only to provide an ornamental piece of water, but a bath In which many more than those who, in the present repulsive condition of the water take 260,000 baths yearly, may seek health and recreation, your committee are of opinion that the common mode of supply- Ing a lake with freshI water is preferable to the new and in- genious contrivance of refiltenng continuously even a larger annual quantity than can be supplied from a well or a river.
			" 12. If a supply of fresh water suffident not only to re- place the waste, bat to provide for a continual change, were impossible to be obtalned, in the absence of another alteTnative, filtratloa might be justifiable; but your com- mittee believe that such a supply of fresh water may be ob- tained from the springs within or contiguous to the Serpen- tine, from an enlargement of the water shed of the parzl and Kensington-gardens. and from other sources which have been pointed out to the committee. Some of thts snpply may be obtained by means of simple gravitation, at a smaU
			1' 13. Conflicting evidence has been given as to the quan- tity and quality of the water that can be pumped from the well in Duck Island. but hfr. Hawkesley-states in his evi- dence that he entertiains no doubt that a considerable sup- ply of water can be procured in the neighbourhood of his works, and that an increased amount of water could be drawn into the Serpsntine by an exteneton of the surface drainage of the park and Kensignton-gardens.
			" 14. We have hai, however, a more embarrassing task than to decide merelF whether Mr. Hawksley's pl-n is the best for effectually cleansdng the Serpentine. We have bad to consider whether that plan, recommended by great engineering authority, adopted by the Executive Govern- ment, sanctioned by Parliament, and nearly approaching its completion, is so umsatiafactory in its object and means that it ought to be arrested, even in its present stage of advance- ment, and the work which has been performed diverted to other purposes. After much patient investigation, we have arrived reluctantly at the conclusion that the proposed filtration will not bo effectual for the desired object, and that this cleansing process ought not to be carried on in one of the most beautiful spots of Kensington-gardens. We recommend, therefore, that the project of filtration be abandoned, and that the best available supply of fresh water be poured in to such an excent as to produce some continual flow.
			" 13. Whenever the Metropolitan Board have completed their works for the dlversion of sewage from the Serpen- tine measures should be taken for rendering the bedof the lake clean and hard. We have not come to any conclusion as to the extent to wrhich the mud ought to be removed, hardened, or covered, nor as to the relative merits of ravel or concrete as a covering, nor as to the expediency of burn- ing it, nor as to the depth which would besb promote the convenience and saiety of bathers and skaters and the purity of the water; but we are of opinion that the present condition of the bed of the Serpentine absolutely requires
			amendment."

			IRISH LABOUR1?RS ANVD TB'NANT PARIUBRS.
			TO THrE FDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-In Tlce Timcs of yesterday it is reported that Lord Clanricarde said, in the House of Lords " it was shown by the petition of the 'Westimeath Farsme' Club that there were 100,000 labourers' dwellings in Westmeath, valued at from 5s. to ls. a year." But that was stated, in the petitfon, to be the estimated number of such dwellimgs in the whole of Ireland. It is also reported that Lord Westmeath said "the petition was only the petition of one gentleman." This is also incorrect; it was the all but unanimous ex. preesedwish of the whole club; and last year about 30 petitions for the same object were presented in Parliament signed by many of thte leading nobility and gentry in dif- ferent parts of Ireland.
			It is tue the BIll was introduced by Sir WilUiam Somer- ville in the form that, I suggested would be most suitable; and It has been passed now in two sessions by the House of Commons in that form. But their Lordships have now in- serteda clause which, as I informed the Government before, havingonferred with the best practical legal authority on the subject, wil most certainly if it become law, endanger the Government sec nity for al loans made under the pro. vions of the Act. I tell them so again now through The Times, Moreover, this additional clauise would confer a most arbitrrypolwer of eviction against the labouring classes at the hands of the Commssioners who could not carry out the condlitions that might be require without setting the whole country in an uproar.
			The English Law Amnendraent Society stated in a report some years since, "ID. has been matter of regret ever since the Board of Agriculture was dissolved, as all the most use- ful suggestions on landI questions applicable to that period emanted from that Board." The Westmneath Farmers Club Is endeavouri, to somne erotent tosupply that want in Freland. Their Ten-ant Farmers' Emnblements Bill was to- troduceed into the Coisamons on iChursda, night last. But the same night their Tenant Farmers' mprovements Bill was refused to be admiaied - although it was the first time the dond fide tenant fiirmers bad eversubmitted such a Bill t-o Pmwllament, hoping that they woulki at least obtaln a hsearin in their ownnee

			THE POST-OFFICE.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Having read the articles which appeared in ne Times the other day concerning "The General ost-office," and feeling pleased at their appearancw and somewhat inter- ested in the facts which you there brought forward, perhaps you will allow me a word or twFo in confirmation of what you therestated.
			You stated in that article that for want of more men and more room a great number of newspapers werefrequently left behind, which Bhould have been sent by the evening mails until the next morning. This is quite correct, for f have myself seen a very great number left behind for the samae reason that you mention ; and I think, if you will in- vestigate the matter, you ild fiud that most of those papers have had thxe late fee paid upon themi for their immediate delivery.
			You state, also, that a great many letters are left behind for the same reason. This aloi perfectly correct. The officials in the office tell you that they are circulars ; but this is in- correct, for, if they had time to look at them to see if they really were circulars, th2imight as well sort them. Bnt how can they distinguish In cases a letter of importance from a circular? And if they refer to those circulars which come from "large firms" in thousands, and which are paid as much for as though they were letters, I con tell you that they are generaly sorted first, and nothing that comes into the office Ios li kely to reach its destination in proper time as those unfortunate cirelars.
			Youa also referred to the Initial letters, buLt the most glaring fact in connexion with this affair has never yet been stated by any one. You were quite correct in saying that the men did not sort according to the initial letters, but by the address. For instance, the other day I was myself standing up to sort, and a letter came into my hands addressed to acme one n-ear St. Paul's, which had the Initials " S. E." Well, woualdI It do for me to send that letter over London- bridge to the sonth-eastern district, or must I sort it accord- ing to the address, as any man in his right rind would do? It is really astonishing to see the vast numaber of letters that are delayed through this piece of foolery, which only arose from a false economy. When the midday mall arrives all the letters whichhave no initlalson them are pickedoutfrom the rest and delayed f or about two hour. The men who go out with the mnidday post and take about 70 letters would, if they'took the non-initialed, have about 170. Can the bus- ness men of the gremtest and most enterprising city In the world put up vith this? Is this the wa h 'h merchant Pinces have amassed their frtunes? We are told that this is a " urog-ressive age"' " that we live in fast times ;` but crtainli' tT Post-office is a step behind. I coumld tell you a. multitude of facto tha-t would starftle the nation concemitng the Post-office-facts that appear so ab- surd that we are afraid to tell them for fear of being laughed at. But let us have a Parliamentary inquiry, candid, open, and fair, and we ask no more. We can then bring up these ungarnisbed facds, which wdUilluslctrate better than anything else the Present manasement of the Post-office._

			THE SCOTCH HEBBING FISHERy,
			TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIMES
			SIr,-I beg leave to call your attention to the present systemn of trawling herrings now carried on along the shores of Scotland, and which, if continLued wil lead to the utter annihilation of herrings andI other fish with which otur shores so abundantly abound.
			Herrings have alw,ays been caught with drift nete, and the present Act of Parliament (Ilth and 15th'of Victoria, chap. 26) makes It compulsory that no other net should be used. Notwithstanding this, the Fishery Board (who have the full control) allow the fishermaen to catch herrings at any time and by any, means they heat can without seeking to enforce the law. The net generally uses for trawling varies in size from a-half to a-quarter inch mesh, and even lees ; this being dragged along the bottom of the sea, either in deep or shallow water, disturbs the spawning beds, anld brings with it myrias of herring-fry in a Stat unfit for human food, which would otherwise, if left alone, become large fiue fish. Wherever herrings arc exterminated all other fish disappear, and this fact would be well worth the attention of these who take any Interest in the salmon fisheries.
			The herring fishing of Sweden was at onae time 1,000,000 barrels, and now it is not 3.000. Again, on our own coast, at Dunbar on theo east anLd Ballautray on the west, a single hcrring cannot be got for 4,000 or 5,000 that were to be had at one time, and this Is simply owing to the destrucetive use of the trawl net, and for want of a close time for the fishings as in the ease of salmon and game.
			The L-ord-Advocate for Scotland has brought in a Bill in Parliament for the better regulation of the fisheries, leaving the management under the entire control of the Fishery Board ; hut, as the Commissioners of that Board have not put the presenLt law in force (which provides for the sup- pressIon of trawling), it is not expected that any good can come from them by granting more extended powers.
			If we are to see our fisheries prosper and that nursery of oar navyproperlycarcU or, we should have thoroughly intel- ligent and practical mnen as Commissioners of the Board of Fisheries, andlnot mere theorists, who have no interest in the fishings beyond the pay of a sineourist.
			This week a large public meeting was held here of ctorers, fishermeni, merchants, and others from difrerent parts of Scotland interested in the herring fisheries, and I observe that the resolutions passea at that meeting per nyu columns, and trust it may have the effecofauntete- tion of the English members to the sbet n eev their su,pport whLen the BUil again comern oePrlaet

			ThE YbRENCHl EXPEDITION TO CHINA.-TWO Of the French squadron have left for China, L'Andromaque onk te1tofebrnary, and L'Entreprenant on the 15th. There are stil nine In the Bay. It Is said, in reference to this China expedition, that so peat enthusiasm prevailed In the Frenceh army on the subjec, tat more than 10 times Is many volunteers offered themselves as were requLired. The credit opened to defray the expenses of the expedition is 2,000,0001. The colonel of the 101st Regiment is Colonel

The general staff is composed of IAeut-Colonel Dupin, Chief of the Topographical De- partment, MEajor Campenon, Captain Couls, and Cap)tain Chanoine. The 2d battalion ofaCheur are provided with cloaks of thick- blue cloth, having capes hoods, and wide

			!AYJfMAEZ' TEHATk, I
			Lat nlghis Amy Sedgwlck gave a series of "read. ings," which to a snguar degree displayed Eer versatility and intelligence, wel as thosa quAlities were known before. The pieces read were selected from the most varied sources, some being in verse, some in prose, some- dramatic, some descriptive, somelyric. ScenesfromShakespesresBom7coand JuZid were folowed by the "Lady Clara Vere de Vero," of a Tennyson; then came the speeh of Mr.Ser5et Bnzfoz-. rom Ar. Dickens's PZa7aic.D to be smcceeded by the Lochi5s Warning of Campbell, and Tennyson's Balatvaoa. All this made up Part L The other part comprLsed the Gardmer's Dasughtc of Tennyson, the two scenes of Sir Peter and Lady Te-le, the episode of Modus and Helen from the HunCUad, and an epilogne In verse written by Mr. Tom Taylor, and abounding with allusions to the Ride Volen. teers.
			That Miss Amy Sedgwick could be forcible and tm- passloned in the scenes from Romeo and JTulitt, winning and vlvacions sa Cousin Helen, arch and pointed as Lady Teale, mlght have been expected by any one who had wit. I nessed her theairical performances, but few could have an-
			ticipated the intensity with which she gave the " Lochlel" and the " Charge of the Six Hundred." Not having cha- racter to Impersonate, she seemed to pat on the spirit of the poet himself, and to witness the growth of the objects she deszcbed. This appearance of insplration made the poems in question the most effective of the entire serles, the least happy effort being the speech of the bullying cousel, which alone lackeid chacter and colour. The comedy scenes were charmingly given, and, as those between Modus and Helen depend in a great measure on the business of the scene, it is the greatest pralse to Miss Sedgwilck to say that she rendered them thoroughly amnusing by the mere aid of such indications of action as are compatible with a " reading." The physical strength she displayed on the occasion was scarcely less re- markable thanher intelleothal achievements. With every piece she had to begin anew, and to make a separate display, and yet she was just as fresh and vigorous while going through the military evolutions connected with Mr. Tay- lor's address as In the balcony scene with which she com. menced. Nevertheless the performance had lasted two hours and s-half, the short intervals of repose being flled up by appropriate music.
			Applauded throughout, and vehemently cheered at the [end of her" readings," there is no doubt that Miss Sedgweck has firmly establlshed herself in her new capacity. The en- tertainment wlll be repeated during the whole of this week, with the exception of GoodFrday.

			AfONDA Y POPULAR CONWERTS.
			At tho seventeenth concert last night, which attracted a ,very large audience to St. James's-hall, there was a most Interesting selection of instrumental pieces from the inex- haustible repertory of Mozart. Among the rest two were given for the first time at these concerts-tbe Fantasia in o minor for pianoforte alone, and the Quintet in E flat for piano and wind lnstrnments (oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn). The first-a noble specimen of jantasia, accord- ing to Mozart's notion-Is a "fantasy" in the mostromantlo signification of the term, crowded with melodious phrases, transltions as beautiful as they are unanticipated, and traits of harmony and modulation that keep the attention of the hearer constantly onthe alert. Had our modernfantasia been the legitimate result of this original conception, the pilanit's library would be enriched in proportion, and the shelves of the music publisher groan under a much less heavy weight of unmeaning scales and "arpeggios." The quintet Is, perhaps, withont exception the most finisbed and ingenious of Iozart's concerted pieces for the chamber. The design is as faultless as the ideas are novel, flowing, and spon- taneous; while the variety of combinations to which the five instruments are subjected is nothing shorC of mar- vellous. Both fantasia and quintet received ample justice at the hands of thetr executants, the ptanist being Mr. Bene- dict, whose familarity with the music of the classical mas- ters is notorious, and the wind iustrument players Messrs. Nicholson (oboe), Lazams (clarinet), Chisholm (bas- soon), and C. Harper (horn) all professors of acknowledged eminence. The quintet tn A major, for clarinet and stringed instmments (UL Sainton, Herr Rles, Mr. Doyle, and M. Paque), was repeated for the third time; and the same honour was conferred on the sonata for violin and planoforte, in B flat, played to perfection by X Sain- ton and Mr. Benedlet, the slow movement (andantino soee- nuto) being encored with the same warmth as on a pre- vious occasion, when the sonata was intrusted to the same accomplished performers. A more admirable selection of instrumental chamber-music has not been heard at the Monday Popular Concerts. Each composition was in its way a masterPieCe; and what Mozart bimself thought of the quintet in E flat may be gathered from his lettersi to his father, in one of which, dated Vienna, April 10, 1784, the following passage occurs:
			Myv three eabcriptlon coneerts have dons me great service. The oue in the tbeatre was wonderfully suosesefuL I had oomposed for I
			two grand concertos. for piano and orchestra, and also a quintet, for piano and wind lstraLnent. which lest gave extraosdinasv pleaume I myself esteem It the beet I ever wrote.'
			What would be thought of a musician in the present day able to produce at one performance two new concertos and anew quintet of his own composition? To Mozart, how- ever, such a feat was nothing at all extraordinary.
			The vocal music-as good in its way as the instrumental- introduced for the first time at the Monday Popular Con- certs Miss Laura Baxter, who already counts among our best contraltos and is rapidly naking way in public favour. This young lady sang "Lascio ch'io planga," one of the most beautiful airs from Rinaido-landel`s first Italian opera, or rather thefirst he wrote for England-and sang It with an oe- pressionthoroughly congenial, altogether devoid of exaggera- tion,and at the same time fullyrealizing the intentions of the composer. Mendelssohn's "Savoyard "is less sutted to Miss Baxter's style, and, moreover, was talcen too slow for Its legAtimate effect. The other vocalist was Mr. Sims Reeves, who sang so well and created such enthusiasm, that he was compelled to repeat both the airs set down for him, although the first (" Oh beauteous daughter of the starry race ") was an English version of one of Beethoven's sri sacred songs (Sechs geistliche
			iede-r) to the text of GeDert. a composition quite as long and serious as itis beantiful. Such artand suchfeeling,how- ever, would have made even ordinary musio acceptable, and was not likely to remain unappreciated with one of the most impressIve songs of the inspired Beethoven as the medium of its exbibition. In another style the charming serenade of Herr Molique, - When the moon is brightly shining
			proved equally attractive, and won An entcre just as hearty and unanimous. That Myr. Reeves was fully sensible of the sympathy manifested towards him was shown near the end bf the concert, when, in consequence of the non-arrival of one of the chief performers, the quintet (the last piece) could not bo pro- ceeded with, and, the patience of the audience exhausted, manifestations of dissatisfaction, wholly unprecedented at these entertainments, began to take place. A short speech from Mr. Benedict, however, announcing the cause of the delay, and coupling his explanation with the statement that Mr. Sims Reeves had volunteered to filU up the hiatus with "Adelaide," was acknowledged by tumnltuous applause; and when the popular singer made his appearance on the platform he washononredwith such a reception as is seldom accorded to a public performer. There being nocopy at hand, Mr. Reeves had to sing, and Mr. Benedict to play the accompaniment, from memory; nevertheless, nothiing was lost by that; and rarely, perhaps, has Beethoven's in- comparable song been delivered waith more touching express- close, or heard with greater delight.
			The next Monday Popular Concert (AprIl 9th) is to be devoted exclusively to the music of English composers.

			MiDDLBsEx Comner LtNATrC Asv1Ti'.sOn Tuesday evening, tho 27th nit, a concert was given to the patients in one of the large ining halls of thiR InBtitu- tion, making the fifth during the wvinter. They have pre- vlously been held in the large ward, but, the number at- tending increasing each time, it has been foand necessary to resort to greater space. On this occason about 400 female and 50 male patients were present, and a large number of attendants; also several of the magistrates, the medical superIntendent of each department, and others of the neci- cal etaffi The performers consisted of amateurs, profes- sional gentlemen residing In town. Several pieces and solos for violoncello, violin, and flute by the great composers were performned, much to the enjoymnent of the patients, who encored on several occaions. Four part songs and Negro melodies also formed part of the programme. It was re- mnarkable to observe the great attention and quietude of the patients. Mtr. Toelle one of the assistant medical officers of the institution, has be�en at the pains of getting up these concerts, being fully convinced of the great benefit and pleasing effect of musio upon the minds of the patients. Too much credit cannot be given to those gentlemen who have so kindly aided In contributing to the pleasure of so large a number of afflicted inmates.
			ST. GEORG5SR'S--THE'EAST.-By direction of Sir TRichard Mayne the large body of police, consisting of be- tween 200 and 300 men, who have attended the parish church of St. George's-in-the-East during the last few weeks, have been withdrawn, and at the services last Sunday there were not more than a dozen present. The congregation took advantage of the circumstance, and showed some dis- position to be famultuorxs, especially durlng the seraon, which was preached by Mr. Mackonochie. The rector was loudly hissed when he pronounced the benediction from the altar.

			THEROYALGENERAZ 2HRA2RIUALBUD.
			Yesterday,belng the 15th anniversary of Ths instItution, of which Her MaUeaty is the municent patrones, the members, following atime-honourea custom, dinmd together in the evemig at the zreemasons' Tavern, in cormemora- tIon of the ooccsion. Mr. Tom Taylor acted as chairnan, with Colonel Idndsay, Colondl Commandant of tho St. George's Volunteer Rifle Corps, and Mr. Halibarton, M.P, on Ils right and left. Some 200 gentlemen were present, Including all the mors notable professors of the histrionic art in the metropolis, and the festival was also graced by the prespce of a goodly number of ladies, who occupied seats on the dais t ttLhe head of the room and in tha gallery at the foot. On the removal of the cloth,
			The, tAslRAs, who had prevfoucly given in succession the toast of " The Queen" and thar of " The Prince Consort and the rest of the Royal Family, the Prince of Wales ex- cepted," amid the aclanmations of the company, proposed " The Prince of Wales and the British Colonles." (Cheers) They mlght be surprised at the juxtspositlon, but there was good reason for it, seeing that the Prince of Wales was the heir-apparent of the throne of this lingdom, whlte the British colonies were the heirs-apparent of its strength andgreatness, It was well, therefore, that the tWO he,irsapparent should beoame acquainted with each other.
			he rne of Wales was just completing that part of his education which was to be learnt from books. At home, at Edinburgh and at Oxford, he was taking a survey of what literature and science had done ; and now he was entering upon that not less imoortant branch of educatlon which was to be acquired in the great book of the world. He had already visited that region of the Old World in which he had been enabled to study art in its noblest relics, andtoseenationalgreatnessinthetwilightof itstraditlonsand inthe decrepitude of its remains. He was now about to turn from the book of the OldWorld to that of the Yew, where, In British North America, he would see a noble and puissant peole n te irs flshof outfu stengh,not devoted to arts, but waging a sturdy conitict with untamed nature ; not reposiug en the ashes of a great past, but reaching for- wa�rd to the achievements of a glorious future. (Cheers.)
			The toast was drunk with enthutsism.
			Mr. IALnsLLuTost, M.P., briefly responded to the toast, with which his name had beon coupled by the chairman. Hle said it would be great presumption in him, who had neither officia rank, nor social position, to return thanks ou behalf of the Prince of Wales; but, having be orn in British North America, and having rsided here for by far the greater part of his life, whither also his family hefore him had emigrated 150 yearnsago, be should be loss than mort if he did not feel attached to a people whose many virtues he well kIe andL respected, and among whom he numbered nearly all the friends heha
			in the world. (Cheers.) The chairman having alluded to him, in his character of " Sam Slick," as " knowing the time of day" (a laugh), he miogt state that since he had come to reside in this country he bad ooservea there was a noted clock which would not go (a laugh), and he thought from hi&amp;antecedeats he might have beenx chosen chairmani of thecom7mitteeforitsregnlation. (Alaugh.) Itwasamisfortmne that the clock wonldlnot go, for it mxight teach members of the HEncue of Commons the value of time. It might teach them there was something else to do besides talk, and teach even Mr. Bright there was something butter than spinning long yarns. (A. laugh.) He couldl not for a moment doubt that the visit of the Prince of Wales to British _North America would be productive of great good, for there he would see an appanage of the Crown equal to one-ninth part of the habitable globe, - unequalled for the extentt of its inland navigation by any other part of the world, and inhabited by 3,000,000 of people as intelligent, as enterprising, and as loyal as any in
			Her Majesty's clomizions. (Cheers.) He was delighted that his Royald Highness was going there, and that the people would have an opportunity of ex.hlbiting the loyalty which animated thema. Hle was net the first of the Rloyal family who had been there. His grandeire, the Delcoe of Kent,lwas Commander-in-Chief In that country, and in him every colonist founkd a friend andl a patron. Mrx. Gladstone, the most eloquent as he was the most reckless of Ministers (a laugh), might abolish the differential duties with respect to the tradle of Nlorth Amnerica, but the people would still be oun bydefretia duiesto heEnglish Crown. (Chere.)Of is Ryal ighess,theheir-~apparent, he woud oly urter ay,lon miht e cntiueto he Princea

			9Vo the toast of " The Army and the Volunteers " Colonel LIN1sAY, Colonel-Commandant of the St~ George's Volun- teers, returned thanks.
			The CHaxRssAss then gave the toaut of the evening, "Prosperity to the Royal General Theatriral Fund," re- marking in doing so that he had assumed a position which for 15 successive years had been occupied by distinguished actors, politicians, orators, statesmen, anid men of letters. Of the aim and objects of thae institution he need say littie -they epol-e for themselves. We lived in an ago of free trade. In. theatres, as in traffic, there were protec- tionists,-a highly respectable, if not a numerous, body, wvho sighed for the old days of vrotective patents. Thiose patents, however, had gione ; bat the funds had not gene with them, for they stil existed to provide comforts for the anmiultants, yealy becoming fewer and fewer, tfLU Je supposed some last survivor would dlie worth all the pro- perty of each, and leave It, as he ought, to the General TheatricalFund. (Alaugh.) He rejoiced in the success of this fund; aboveali,itrts cathoUcity. Hehimuself,asthey allknew, was a tolerably industrious contributor to the metropolitan stage. Ile had worked for .Astley's as well as the Hay. market; and he had done that upon principle, as much as from good will, believing that all theatrical art, if worthy, should be guided by the same principles, and that in the remotest East-end theatre,I as well as in the moot fashion- able, the mirror might be held up to natore. (Cheers.) Hle held that it was of the utmost Importance that there should he an institution like this, which recognised in the most striking form that the Interests of managers, actors, and authors were essentially one, engaged as they were in one common work, and seeing that no one among the ~ss s grat s tat e mghtnotbe reduced to the necssiy o beomig aclaman onitsbounty. (Hear, hea.) he haimanconludd bproosig " The General Thetrial und asocitin wih te oast the name of Mr. lucaton, te hooray trasuer.(Cheers.)
			M1r. BucKsTsoNE responded to the compliment in a facetious speech, in the course of which he stated that the capital of the fund would that night amnount to about 12,0001. ; that during the first year the managing body had paid 11 annuities, ranging fromn 301. to 001. each, defrayedl the funeral expenses of three deceased members, given 501. with smalier amounts to claimants, had voted 2z01. to- wards building a house for the Dramatin College, and yet they were better off by nearly 5001. than they were months ago. He added that they had 168 subscribing mem- bers; and although this was a theatrical fund, establishedl for a purpose that they were often told was " a stench in the nose of piety," yet, not only could they show their ac-

			FRA'UDSLE7T TAD3 HAWRS.
			DEPUTATIONT TO THE BOA:D OF TRAJY_
			tio fo upesigtuPactice of Falsey Mrigo
			Ibel or Sale, n comPrsng representh es o
			several mercantile haouses in London. Mutilciseser, Bfrming. han, Hudderslield, &amp;c., had an interview O '
			with Mtr. MUlner Gibson, at the Board of Trade, in order to3 urge upon the Government the necessity of adopting ca&amp;., sores for the suppression of the system.
			M1r. Roebuck, MP.~, Mr. Thomas Barley, M.X., Mrr, WilliamScholefield, M.P. ancld J. El. Brown Weethelad, ALF., accomDanled the deputatlon, which comprisea.Mir Edmund AsAiworth, 'Mochester; Ir. Ulement Gibbs of ths firm of NT. Corah and Sons, Birmingham; Mr. Cha rl.e
			Brook, jnn., Huddersfield; hr. James Pittimn (Carlites, Pittman, and Co.), London: r. Johm Howell (Ells and Bverlngton), London; Mlr. William Brown (Brown, Davlg, and Co.), London; Mr. C. H. Minchin, Manchester; Mr. John Symons (R&amp; Symonds and Son), London, &amp;c.
			Mr. BRooES, jun., said he had been requested to brlng the subject of trade marks on goods under the notice of the Board of Trade, and he was glad to find that it ws- intended to introduace a Bill into Parliament with re
			terence to the matter in question; but the obiect thsp had speeclly in view on that occasion was to &amp;now Mr. Gibson the extent to which the practice of mellung "short lengths" prevailed, in order that thoe legila. ture mlght interfere and put an end to a most unfair and dishonest practice. The. practice to which he refered waa carrled to such an extent; and was so common, that people began to think there was no fraud in it at all. One form of the system which was not quite so serious as some of the others, ns in this caso the purchasers could examine the lengths themselves, ws in the sole of cotton clothe the description being what waS caled " seven-elghths," ans
			which should contain a certain length, but were fousan deficient. The principal evil existed in the case of cotton, and thread. This system of telling falsehoods ws most di. creditable to the tone of commercial mDrality, and was in. jarlous to the honest trader, and what they wintEd was that the Legislature should glve the country to all, that protection which would enable the honest manufacturer to compoete with the dishonest one. With the. present system it was not possible to do EO, and the mann. t'acterer who dested to temainhonest musEt cithersobmit to be reined, or give up business altogether. He considerer that any person selling goods which were not of the length or lsze they purported to be should be found guilty of a mils, demeanour. He then handed to hIs. Gibson a reel of cotton marked as containing 100 yards, but in which there wers only 45 and also reels marked 300 yards, but contsinlnI only 20k) Yards.
			Yr. MrIsnsc Gsxuos.-Now, upon the question of shork measure, I suppose the law deals with that already?
			Mr. RoEnucL-Yes, but by a very roundabout procear and we wish to obtain an enactment enabling us to preZe4 summarily as a fraud.
			Mtr. BRooE, jun.-These reels are not only a fraud as to the measure, but are an Imitation of our own mak. WQ go now, however, only on the question of shor' measure.
			Mr. AsEvoRTm said, with reference to the crlmlnal law, Lord Redesdale would not pass a Bill with peal stautes as
			well as the other Bill, but a short Bill, with two clauses ; it providlng for the case, could be carried by the Govern. ment. With regard to the short measure, there were reels sold in which the maker's naLme was fals, the length ws fase, and the quality wa false. Thes could not ascertain who manufactured them. If they askled the dealer, he would say he did nob Imuow the length wras short, as he -never measured It, and he (3!;q Ashworth) thought this should be rendered compulisory. The question was not an insignificant one involving two or three thousrand pounds, but hundreds of thousands cC pounds were Invested Inthattrade. o.There was anothez brach n wichthi sytemwascariedon; he referred, to the jsconnots for lining coats; these were rolled n
			very tight, and tied in parcels labeled 20 or 2t yard, but in reality there were only 18 yards this was sometimes reduced even to a stilllower number~ and there was nothing to prevent Itgononnthr There was no individual remedy; therefore theycamo th Government to nask them to makeo a lwwihwudpo test the honest trader. It was customa for many woul sj to give orders for goodls purporting to bd of ceranlnw but to contain a less quantity, andifoem uacue did not do It amother would. This was done in cotton, thread, jaceonoots, and tapes, but especIally In hap
			and through this most unjustifiable sysesoefth rt houses In 11anchester were stigmatizedwihfad
			Mr. BOOTr.-Is not the purchaser to blame if, on buyln a real of cotton short in length, he does not say,"Ti does not contain 100 yards?"
			Mn.AsnwonvsT.-The dealer would ray he did not mnakat it. Mr. Juetice Coleridge had given an opinion in MD5 that an indictment for false pret-ences could be sustained.
			Mr. RoErucL.-If you make every man responsible foe what he sells you will make him honest.
			MrX. AL Gcusos.-Are these goods sold for less money?
			Mtr. AhSHwonr said they were not sold to the public at a lower rate. The price of reels was 4s. d. per eons fot
			the short lengths, wvhich were sroller in every other. respect to the genLuine artilele; the maanufacturer tooLs 3s. Gd., the retailer thus getting Is. a gross adiftionall profit. He didl net think there was any man in the Houa
			of Commons who could raise an objection to a Bill which provided a remuedy for these nefarious practices. The Sam
			thing was done with silk; not only was the length cutaUledl- huLt the name and stamp of some well-known firm imitated.. These silks, jacconots, tapes, threads, &amp;a., were sent to, India, Australia, the Cape of Good Hope-all over the wrorld, in fact, and, he asked, was England to continue to be atg;. matized with these frauds?
			Mir. flMIs~x produced several reels, -which he said he brea purchased from large houses in London. They were marked as contalning 100 yards, hut there were only 42 yards. He, considered tfie difficulty lay with the wholesale houses.
			Mfr. MnilaT Grosos, said he thought tbey had establlshs&amp;i their case, and he should be glad if they would prepare a, clause which wo-uld meet it, which *ould be considered - bTit he saw some difficulties in the way; he could faney thS 100 yards of bobbin could be made which did not containt 100yards, but which,by conmmonconseutoerunderstandig In. the trade, had come to be censidered as euch, without any imputation of fraud.
			After some conversation, Mr. ROEBucK, saiid there was a mnan in America named Collins, who had a great reputation for the axes he made ; every one used Collins's axe, and the, Birmingham manufacturers consequently mnde simiilar axes, which they stamped with the name of Coflln, and sent to America for sale. TIhis was done by every houise in Bir- mingham, excepting three.
			It was then arraoged that a draught of a Bill shouldi beo prepared to be submitted to the law officers of the Crown, with a view of meeting the case.
			' The deputation, having thanked Mr. Milner Gibsonl, then
			withdrew. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

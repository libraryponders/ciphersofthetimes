			The good effected is not, however, to be measured merely by the I amnount of money given away-the rums distributed have in very maniy ewses ca.ed forth the assintance of otdthddana who otherwise might not have ceontibuited at all to ttte relief of the applicants. This more

			The ODES of BORACB, TRANSLATBD by
			THBODORE MABRTIJNJ
			The existing translations of Horace partial or complete, in our own language alone, defy enume- ration. Even of late years we have been favoured with several new versions, such aa those of Mr. Robinson, MIr. Whyte Melville, MIr. F. W. New- man, Lord Ravensworth, and AMr. O'Brien. But the procession of translators is not yet exhausted, nor in all probability will it finaUy cease until Doomsday. Like the images in the witches' mirror,-
			" Another and another still succeeds,"
			and we see them winding into the perspective of futurity like a pantomimic series, or like the lamps of a great poetic Piccadilly. Mir. Theo- dore ML-artin passes in review at this particular moment, bearing his complete version of the Odes and Epodes. But who will come next? or who will come last? Who wiU be plaiting Pyrrha's tresses, or bottling off the last drippings of the Bandusian fount, when the tail of some wandering comet sweeps the globe itself into an untranslatable chaos of dust and ashes?
			At all events, til the next geological convulsion we are as sure of fresh translators as of fresh peas or fresh gooseberries. That attraction to so many generations of hardy navigators, the discovery of a north-west passage, is a fait accompli ; but the dis- covery of the best version of Zlorace is an immortal problem, perennially open, vet for ever insoluble. In the nature of things it is impossible to translate Horace perfectly. As Shelley says, some of the volatile strengath and delicacy of the original must inevitably escape in the crucible, and the sublima- tion be incomplete. But even those who, like 1r. Martin himself, are aware of this inevitable draw- back, will, nevertheless, persevere. The attempt, often made, will be as often renewed. Dukez percul est. The very difficulty of the task makes it! attractive in the view of MEr. Martin, who is even eloquent on the fascination to which he has succumbed.
			Now, in what does this peculiar fascination of Horace consist? for we must remember that in the same degree it is the property of no other poet. Mlr. MIartin quotes Ovid and Quintizian, and he leavea us to infer that Quintilian's criticism on the Odes is especially to the point in question,- "Lyricorum Horatius fere soluB legi dignus, nam et insurgit aliquando, et plenus est jucunditatis et gratize, et variis figuris et verbis felicissime audax." Thus says Mr. Martin, in this airy and playful grace, in happy epithets, in variety of imagery, and exquisite felicity of expression, the Odes aro still un- surpassed among the writings of any period or lan- guage. It is, no doubt, true that only in a few instances do they riee to grandeur of thought or are marked by a high strain of emotion or of imaginative expression; but if they want for the most part the inspiration of a great motive, or the fervour and resonance of the finest lyrics of Greece, they possess in perfection the power of painting an image or expressing a thought in the fewest and fittest words, combined with a melody of cadence always delightful. "It is these qualities, and a pre- vailing vein of genial and sober wisdom, which imbue them with a charm peeuliar, and have given them a hold upon the minds of educated men which no change of taste has shaken." In common vwith ir. MAartin, we may asorlbe to these qualities a very potent fascination, and still fall short of the veritable secret. What is it which impels so many an edu- cated man not only to admire tne Horatian felicities, but invariably to desire to convert them into his own terminology? WVhat but that he feels Horace's thought is his ownn; that there is no poet so cosmo- politan as well as Roman, so purely mundane as well as so choice ? It is this quality which no one term comprises, but which is beat represented by the epithet modern, which makes Horace so at- tractive to a succession of translators. Mlr. Haunay has said strikinaly, but very truly, that the Horatian tone of thinking is more consonant to the average mind of our own day than the tone which prevailed among our ancestors in the days of Queen Elizabeth. It was truly a wonderfully tempered fusion of human qualities which has so overleaped the races and the centuries to etand beside us as the counterpart of our very selves. But 7mwdern Horace is, and modern he will remain so long as we dine and delight in womanly grace, so long as we talk a mild worldly philosophy, and are simply the Gorilla prelude to some more ethereal species. Horace would be at home in Piccadilly itself, he would recognize Theodore Mlartin as his familiar - he would find the same accord in Theodore Martin's posterity under any constitution, or tariff, or sun, and his capacity of remaining modern to the end of time is the secret which beguiles his would-be trans- lators. The versifier of any or of every age sees his oWn thought expressed by him in a more restricted language, and he is inevitably impelled to test its onvertibility. But this thought, like the banquet )f Tantalus, is as illusory as it is close. The trans- lator is mocked by a will of the wliSp, which he seems on the point of clutching, but which escapes him by its evanescent qualities. He presses on to make sure of the luminous essence, to seize that which appears to be ever within his grasp, but which is nevertheless in its very nature fugitive and im- palpable.
			The moral would appear to be that no one should waste time on efforts which can never be perfectly successful or satisfactory. But this is hardly so. It is a pleasurable exercise to any and all who take part in the chase, and some may approximate so near to the impossible object that they may win especial credit for their wind and speed. Among the latter we are happy to say that,with certain shortcomings, we are able to count 31r. Tbeodore Martin. One of the Twins of the Bon Gualtier and the translator of G;jethe and Oehlenschlaeger was likely to make good running, and he has certainly made it here. The result has such pretensions that we owe him a careful criticism of what appear to us to be certain blemishes scattered through his performance, ad- mitting, at the same time, that its merits as a whole more than compensate for its defects.
			If we comparo YIr. Mlartin's rendering of particu- lar odes with a few select examples culled from the series of English translators, we shall find, no doubt, that he has been surpassed in particular instances. Ilis Prrhsa,-and whose could be other- wise e-is far less Horatian than MEion's. His ren- dering of the first ode of the first book,
			"Macenas, sprung from monarchs old, "Who dost my fortunes stilU uphold,"
			is bald and tame beside the version of Allan Ramsay:-
			" Dalhousle, of an auld descent,
			" My pride, my stoupe, my ornament."
			His version of the Ode to Licinius in the second book, especialy
			"The man who with a roul serene,
			"IDoth cultivate the golden mean,
			" Escapes allkeefrom aU
			"Tho squalor of a sordid cot,
			And from the jealousies begot " By wealth in lordly hall,"
			has none of the fine equable flow of the lines which, quoting from memory, we usually ascribe to Cowper:-
			" Ile wno holds fast the golden mean, " And lives contentedly between
			" The little and the great,
			" Feels not the wants which wring the poor,
			" Or p.igues which haunt the rlch man's door,
			" EmbtteWng aU his state."
			Again, some of Father Prout's fine potheen- flavoured equivalents, or 1ills and Frere's para- phrase in the Anti-Jacobinv of the "Non itsitatd nec tenui ferar pennd,"-
			"I feel! The growing downdescendr "like gooseslin to my fingers' ends,
			" Each nail becomes a feather,"
			have qualities quite unrivaUed by MIr. Martin's literalness, and, like the outburst of Thomas Ingoldsby,
			E"hel, ftgac-s, Posliume, Postumc,
			Who vill recover the years which are lost to me?"
			echo the notes of the Horatian lyre with a vigour not sustainable, at all events, throughout a volume, where the writer has to grapple with a succession of difficulties after his purpose has exhausted the ori- ginal subjects of his choice.
			The skill of Mr. Martin, when he can himself con- sult his predilections, will be seen in the paraphrase which he adds to his translation of the Ode to Lydia (Book 1, Ode 8); again, in the happy though by no means literal close of the " Ode to Thallarchus" (1, 9):-
			"Gloom Is for age; young hearts should glow
			With fancies bright and free,
			"Should cotLrt the crowded walk-the show, "And at dim eve love's whispers low
			" Beneath tho trysting tree.
			n 2e Odes of iHorace, translated into English verse, with a Life and Notes, By Theodote Martin. J,.F. Parker and.Son. ].S60.
			"The laugh from the sly corner, where
			"Our girl is hiding fast,
			"The straggle for the lock of hair,
			"The half v.el-pleased, half'-antry .dr,
			" The yleded kiss at last."'
			Or again the spirited version of "Laudcabunt ali," or the following stanza from the 8th ode of the second book (to Barine):-
			"cVenns herself doth smile to hear thec swear,
			"Smile the sweet nymphs beneath their sunny hair; " And Cupld, unrelentlng boy, doth smle,
			"Pointing on gory stone his homingfshafts the while."
			Or, agaun, the speeeh of Europa, in the 27th ode of the third book, or in the 17th of the first, this ren- dering of the "'Olentis uxores mariti :"-
			"Then the mates of a lord of too pungent a fragrance ' Securely through brake and o'er precipice climb,
			And crop, as they wander in happiest vagrance,
			"The arbutus green and the sweet-scented thyme,"
			iXore especislly is Mr. ilartin Horatian, and at the same time ingenious, in his rendering of a passage in the 'Quid belicosus Cantaber," the 11th ode of the second book. This passagrehas been often read, by those vho take the first obvious sense which comes, as-
			" Quis devium scortum el5clet domum "Lyden '"
			But the more gramamatical domo is sustained in its place, by a reading for which Horace would have handed Mr. Martin his chaplet:-
			"And who from her home shall fair Lyde seduce, "Axnd brsug to our revel that charming reI'sse 1"
			The ground on which Mr. M artin translates deviem scorturn Eo freely is that he conceives Horace regards the young lady with abantering irony, ashe is taking his expectant ease beneath the pine-tree. " Horace obviouslv means to speak of her playfully and kindly. She was apparcntly coy and hard to be got hold of-not ready to answer to everybody's call ; and I shy little puss' may be substituted for ' charming recluse ' by those who adopt this view." This view, we presume, will behenceforth acceptable to every one for its superior refinement as well as its felicity and a probable penetration of the true Horatian meaning.
			After this we may fairly take Mr. Martin to task for some slovenly verse and slips of miscon- struction. He has a tendency at times to eke out his metre by expletives, thus:-
			"And there be some, we knoew, are fain "FuU cups of ?asssic old to drain." " Septimius, that woulrl'st, I know ::With me to distant Gades go,"
			" Look out, my Traliarchas, roundil
			When he translates "ponnis non homini datis," by" wings not given for mortal wearinug," he im- ports into the original not only a tame but a tailor's conception of plumage, such as we might look for in the poetical prospectus of Moses and Son. Again he is sometimes very slipshod in his rhymes. " Helen" rhymes with " quelling," and " away" with a Acroceraunia" onthe samepage. Yet these are minor blemishes compared with some passages in which as we conceive, MWr. Martin, has misrepre- sented the meaning of his original. For example, in the very ode in which Thaliarchus is requested to look round him:-
			"Leave to the gods all elses; when fres
			"They set the surly winds
			"To grapple on the yeasty sea
			"In headloda strife, the cypress tree " The oldlonsh respite yinds."
			In addition to its novel theory of storm influences as alternating between land and sea, the statement is in direct opposition to the language of Horace:-
			"Permitte Divis a'etera; qui simul "Strarcrc ventos aquore fervido "Deprceliantes, nec oupressi
			Nec veteres agitantur enrt."
			Aaain, in the 13th ode of the first book, we think it is more than doubtful -whether Lydia praised the " snowy" arms of Telephus, vwhen the epithet she used, "cerea," rather implies their pliancy and suppleness. "Quis aquam temperet ignibus," in the 19th ode of the 3d book, translated " who has good baths," appears also to be a misapprehension of the negus-loving propensities of Roman convives; as also the " praetereunte lymphh," in the invitation to Quintius Hirpinus, and which probably means the cool water carried round by the attendant, is rather forcibly amplified into " the brook's deepest pool." Yet on al these points we may allow Mr. MIartin the benefit of a passing doubt, with the ex- ception of the Ist7rar4re," for wvhich we muat inevitably call on the next boy to mend his trans- lation, and to take him down a step in the class, as the penalty of an obvious blunder.
			Returning to the difficulties which no translator can overcome, we find Mir. Martin sometimes adroit in dealing with them, even in cases wvhere we cannot say he has perfectly succeeded. HIow well the sound fits the sense in the following:-
			By Uytherea led, while the moon shines overhead
			",The nymphs and graces, hand in hand, vith alter-
			nating feet,
			"Shako the ground, while swinking Vulcan strikes the
			sparkles fierce and red
			"From the forges of tbe Cyc'ops, dun with smoke and
			lurid heat."
			The amplification of the epithet "graves" at the close of the last line is, however, an example of the discount inevitable in our linguistic exchanges. "U Inder the most skilful hands," says Mlr. Mlartin, " a thought or sentiment must, at times, be expanded or condenEed to meetthe neces- sity of the stanza," and it is rare indeed that the translator can follow his poet passibus aiqis, render- ing him almost word for word without abatement of spirit. In some places Mr. Martin is very close and yet sufficiently nervous, as witness the follow- ing clear equivalents:-
			" Privatus illis census erat brevis,
			" Commune magnum; nulla decempedis
			" Metata privatis opacam
			" Porticus excipiebat Arcton.
			"Man's private fortunes then were low,
			" The public income great; in these, "Good times no long drawn portico
			" Caught for its lord the northern breeze."
			So also in the translation of the "Non obur neque aureum :"-
			" Within my dwelling you behold " Nor ivory, nor roof of gold;
			" There no Hymettian rafters weigh "On columns from far Africa; "Nor Attalus' Imperial chair
			"Rave I usurp'd, a spurious heir, "Nor client dames of high degree "Laconian purples spin for me;
			"But a true heart and genial vein
			"0O wit are mine, and great men deign "To court my company though poor. "For nought boyond do I implore
			"The Gods, nor crave my potent frlen,d "A larger bounty to extend,
			"With what he gave completely blest, "My happy little Sabine nest."
			Here the EngElish version is only two lines longer than the Latin, though the Latin is singularly con- cise and costive ; and yet it misses no point of the original, while it renders a fair equivalent of the pervading sentiment. A still happier, though some- what freer translation, is that of the Ode to Lydia, commencing " Parcibs junctas quatiunt fenestras," and which we extract, not only as a favourable specimen of the better paces, but as an entire heat of M. Martin's Pegasus:-
			"TO LYDIA. "Swains In numbers
			"Break your slumbers,
			"Saucy Lydia, now but seldom,
			" Ay, though at your casement nightly, " Tapping loudly, tapping lightly, " By the dozen once ye held them.
			"Ever turning,
			"light and morning,
			"Swung your door upon its hinges;
			"Nlow from dawn till evening's closing5 "Lone and desolate reposins, "Not a soul its rest infringes.
			"Serenaders,
			"Sweet invaders
			"Scanter grow, and daily scazter,
			Singing, 'Lydia, art thou sleeping? Lonely watch thy love is keeping '
			"Wake, oh wake, thou dear enchanter l'
			" Lomn and faded,
			" Yon, as they did,
			" Woo, and In your turn are slighted;
			"Worn and torn by pas3ion's fret, "You, the pitiless coquette,
			Waste by fires yourself have lighted.
			"Late relenting,
			" Left lamenting-
			"Wither'd leaves strew wintry brooks!
			" Ivy garlands greenly darklng,
			" Myrtles brown with dew-drops sparkling, "Best beseem youth's glowing looks !"
			Thus we perceive what MIr. Martin can accom- plish as a translator; but we can best appreciate the measure of his success by observing him also in his capacity as critic. In the latter capacity he has discussed the bearings of the odes in copious notes, and has prefixed to his volume a Life of Horace, which indicates clearly his estimation of the bard with -whom he has rendered himself so familiar. For the facts of the poet's life, as indi- cated by his works, MIr. MIartin has no doubt referred to some of the many scholars whose infer- ences have been redliued into a popular summary in the recent idfe of the poet by Dr. Mllaman. But there are some points which Mlr. Martin has either .ornated for himself or improved from othe.'
			hints, and which specially arrest attention. One of these is the inference that Horace was an only child, and that his mother must have died while he was very young; because there is no mention of her or Of any of his brothers or sisters, directly or indirectly, throughout his poems. This inference we thirnk correct, as also that Horace was indebted to the tutorship of Orbilius the grammarian, for a learn- ing instilled into himatsome costtohis nether cuticle. tt is also true that Horace is his ovwn biographer, but it is chiefly true in a retrospective and mdirect sense. Bis literary life appears to have commenced after his political career was fairly over. At all events, it attained its complete volume after the pressure of his early privations was withdrawn, and he had obtained the competence which in so many cases muffles the notes of the singing birds. His poetical gemus was most fertile under those conditions of social ease which best accorded with his equable temperament and golden-mean philosophy. " Safis beat's usnicis Sabinis"-in cosy comfort at his Sabine farm, on his thin home-grown wine and rustic fare, he pondered and polished his tributes to the great and his compliments to real or ima- gimary beauties with that sense of delibe- rate enjoyment which pervades all his verse. lUr. Hannay, whose pictures of the poet we have always rated highly (as conceived in the true light, and as checking false idealisms), observes that " his songs would give you a notion that he indulged in a romantic sort of dissipation." This arises from their not being rightly viewed as fancy pictures- pictures on the ivory of the Latin lauguage, of old Lesbian life and Ionian life, further south, and long before. To me Horace seems a far homelier, simpler old gentleman than the classic conven- tionalists would have you suppose. A little, stoutish, weak-eyed, satirical, middle-aged man, sitting-with -what hair he had left smeared with Syrian ointment-crowned, under a vine, drinking, in company of a Greek young woman, with an ivy crown on her head, playing or dancing, is to me a ludicrous object. I do not think that the simple and philosophic Horatius, with his eye for satire, wvas much given to this mode of enjoyment. I am pretty sure that he did enjoy hiuself, but I rather fancy him eating a too luxurious dinner now and then, cramming himself with tunny fish, mussels, oysters, hare, thrushes, peacock, and what- ever else was going; and atoning for it by much quiet and a little rustication in his farm. I am cer- tain that he was, in the main, a homely little man, and that the finish and elegance he shows in his writings did not appear so conspicuously in his per- son and in the objects about him." MIr. Martin apparently agrees with this portraiture, for he con- ceives that the great characteristic of Horace was his good sense rather than a power of "passion" or of pathos. His deepest tones are struck when the decay of morals and the selfishness of faction inspire him with indignation or sadden him into despair; but for the most part he prefers the pleasant themes of friendly intercourse and the fresh associations of natural scenery. He plays with his subjects more often than he feels tbem intensely, and they are generally of an order which dispense with the highest lyrical emotion. For these reasons, says
			Ir. Martin,-
			H Horace was not and could not havo been a national poet. ie wrote only for cultivated men, a3d under the shadow of a Court. Beyond a very narrow circle his works coald not have been read. The very language in which he wrote must have been uninteUigible to the people, and he hsd none of those popular sympathies which inspire the lyrics of Burns or Bcranger. The Roman populace of his time was perhaps as little lIkely to command his respect as any which the world has ever seen; and there was no people, in the sense in which w e understand the word, to appeal to. and yet Hlorace hac m3ny points In common wfth Burns. 'A man'ssa man for a' that,' in the whole vein of its sentiment Is thoroughly Horatian. In their large and genial views of life they are closely akin; but the fiery glow of the peasant poet is subdued to a temperate heat in the gentler and physicallyless energetic nature of Horace.
			*" In his amatory verses the same distinction is visible. Horace writes much about love; but he is never thoroughly in love. None of his erotic poems are vivified by those gushes of emotion which animate the love poetry of the
			oets we have named and of other modern song writers. Never, indeed, was love less ideal or intense In a poet of unquestlonable power. Horace is not insensible to femi- nne attractiveness. He had too much taste for that. In- deed, no wvriter hits oft with greater neatness the portrait of a beauty, or conjures up more skilfully before his reader an image of seductive grace. Bat his tone is more that of a pleased spectator than of one who has loved deeply. Even in wvhat may be assumed to be his earliest poems, the fire of genuine passion is wantisg."
			Mr. Martin has an elaborated note, in which he contrasts him with Catullus in this respect; and the contrast is sustained by a series of translations of the verses to Lesbia, which add another flower to Mr. Martin's chaplet. If they show not only what he can accomplish, but what he may be meditating, they are welcome signs of a metier to which Mir. Martin is addressing himself; in which neither he nor anyone may hope for complete success, but from which he will deservedlv obtain reputation and his readers derive enjoyment.

			EXECUTION FOR Ms sDER.-Serafin Manzano, the Spaniard convicted at the recent Wilts Assizes for the mur- der of Anastatiz Trowebridge, at Ashcombe, on the 3d of November last, was executed yesterday in front of the New Prison, Devizes. The demeanour of the prisoner after his conviction was mild and gentle, and every facUity was afforded by the authorities of the prison for supplying him with the meaus of religious consolation. An Italian convert from Romanism, named Ferraro, who is staying In Devizes was admitted to the prisoner's cell, and at first it was stated that the unhappy man preferred him as his spiritaal adviser to any other person. Mr. Burt, the Mayor of Devizes, who understands Spanish, was subse- quently requested to have an interview with the prisoner, and on his camplying with that request the wvretched man expressed a desire to see a Roman Catholic priest. Catho. licism was, he said, the religion in which he had been brought up, and immediatelythse quesiion was put to him by the Mayor he drew a crucifix from his breast and kissed ib de- voutly. The Rev. Mrz. Clark, of Swindon, was accordingly re- qussted to attend the prisoner till the thmseof his exesutlon. A n image of theVirgrin and ChUldwas placed in his cell, and the prisoner continued throughout most attentive to his religious dutMes. On Sunday the prisoner wrote letters to Mr. Alex.ander, the governor of the prison, and his wife, thanking them for their kindness and at. tention towerdo him during his confinement, and assuring them that he had never committed any crlme. He likewise addressed a communicatlon to the governor's children, charging them nover to be disobedient to their parents. His own father, he stated, was a rli4iosnaire, pos- sesslng two silver mines, but tlsat, through disobeying him, God had chastised him. He added that he had two sisters (nuns) in a convent of rellgious women, caled the Convent of San Francisco. The prisoner slept but little during Tnesday night, and evidently felt his posi- tion most acutely. He drank a httle tea but ate nothing' for breakfast. The priest was in attendance upon him be- tween S and 9, and remained with him up to the hour of execation-12 o'clock. Caicraft, the executioner, arrived on Tuesday afternoon, and slept at the prison. The High Sheriff (Mr. H. N. Goddard) and the Under-Sheriff (lir. 'West Awdry) arrived shortly before 10 yesterday morning. About half-past 11 the pri- soner was asked if he had any request to make. His reply was that he desired nothing but the prayers of those around him, and still continued to protest his innocence. The prison beU commenced tolling shortly before 12, and the High Sheriff then proceeded to the condemned ceol, and demanded the body of the prisoner. The processof plnloning having been gone through, the mournful preces- sion was formed, and, headed bytheprlest, bear a - hted taper and reading the recommendation for a departing soul, took its way towards the drop, arrived at which the wretched culprit mounted the steps fdrmly, and, having placed himself beneath the fatal beam, he appealed to the multitudeto pardon him. He re- mained on the drop nearly 10 minutes, when the rite of ple- nary indulgence having been administered, the signal was glven, the bolt was drawn, and he died w,thout a struggle. The culprit was about 29 years of ege. Threeor four thusand persons had assembled in the vicinity of the prisoner, and all appeared to conduct themselves remarkably wel. After hanging the usual time, the body was taken down and interred within the precincts of the prison. This is the first execution that has taken place at Devises for 11 years.

			PICTU1BS QJ? TIlB CmTa'SE.r
			A series of pen-and-ink etchings of Chinem chb-4 mcters, drawn by one of themselves, has been formed int-o a volume with the aid of written descriptions by the late Archdeacon of Ningpo. Wo or anyone at a glance can spealk for their quaintness, while the Archdeacon hicself, now the rwtor of Broseley, offers himself as sponsor for their accuracy. He asserts that they are faithful representations of the Northern Chinese, the con- tour of whose figures differs muchlfrom the prevailing type of the South. Having resided for eight years at the port of Ningpo and enjoyed frequent opportu- nities of travel in the province of Chekeang, the descriptions which accompany these etchings are also jottings of facts which have come under his observation, anad, in some instances, notes of characters with whom he has been personally ac- quainted. There are 30 of such characters in nll, and some of them are unfamiliar. The etchings of the Chinese Crnik-shank are not deficient in spirit, and the particulars imparted by the Archdeacon, like every testimony of a real experience, will in- evitably add something to our slight knowledge of the originals.
			It might be worth inquiry by some Ruslin in the matter of physiognomv,-Why are the Chinese and their pictures so invariably ludicrous ? To our Western perceptions they are uniformly droll, how- ever solid their pretensions or serious their intent. Apparently they no more conceive of themselves in this light than our Listen could be persuaded that he WalS an lunpresentable Eanmlet. W e, on the othe: hand, should he able to give some philo- sophie reason for oulr invariable inclination to laugh at the features of the Celestials as dis- tinguished from those of other Orientals. Is i. a want of perception on our part of the grave and dignified points of Chinese character, or are there reallv some stubtle absurdities of con- tour, some facial angles and expressions, which inevitably excite merriment? There are some Mandarin ducks now in our Zoological Gardens which have much the same character, and we inclinn to believe that nature directly provides fun for our entertainment, and that this is a final cause of the Chinese countenance and its Chinese accessories.
			If we are mistaken, at all events it is certainly true, that we can hardly conceive of a Chinaman in a tragic or pathetic predicament. We can hardly picture him in physical pain and distress, so as entirely to exclude the notion of his absurdity. The first picture in this volume is that of a Clhinaman with the toothache, and, in addition to the drollery of his attitude at the torture, we have here the joke of his "infallible remedv." The personage with him is the Fewale Quack, who professes to extract a little worm or maggot to which the gnawing pain is attributed. The Arch- deacon has witnessed the operations of tbese ladies, aind can testify to at least their apparent success. When called upon to exercise her skill the woman's arms were bared up to the elbow, and her hands were carefully washed before operating. Nevertlheless, after a little tapping with a bright steel pin which she took from her hair, the maggots were forthcoming, and the spectators, with their utmost vigilance, could not detect the deception. " No one," says the Archdeacon, " bas ever yet discovered exactly how the trick is done; most of the natives seem to know that it is a tricL, but there are still sufficient persons found wil- ling to be deceived, or, rather who resort to this remedy and find benefit from it." Never- theless, the test to which one of these women was subjected in his presence was so uniwelcome, that he could never induce any of the sisterhood to come across his threshold again. A careful cleansing of the steel pin, before each insertion of it, appears to be sufficient to frustrate their infallible remedy.
			The Di7;77er, who deals in the knowledge of lucky and unlucky days, and the young ladies who strike the "f llooccr-d?-?o," and at whEom the Archdeacon, for excellent reasons, shakes his reverend head, are the nest characters in the artist's series. Then we come to the keeper of the Barley-sugar StaZl, who is dispensing his wares to a Chinese gamin, with a nascent tail and a serious expression of superiority to lollipops. Of the latter we are told that he likes to combine w%ith a taste for confectionery an infan- tine inclination for a little roeuqe et oooir.
			"Though so younlg, yet he has his own mind about his monoy, and Wry likely will prefer giving that funny- looking vwheel In front of the sweetmeats a turn, to know whether he is to have double tlhe worth of his mnoney in suger or nono at all. The gambling spirit is even stronEs in infancy, and though the chances are that the sweetmeat- seller will gain, yet he (the ,gnin) cannot reost the temptation. Only think, if he ashould get two pieces of suDar instead of one If he loses, he will stand there watclh. ing while others take their tern; if hc wins, he will ran
			The Archdeacondismisseshim. with the apophthegm that " children are children aU the world over ;" but we should rather infer that in China the chil- dren are precocious speculators, and in other re- spects as nnlike children as they possibly can be.
			The Pihysican in plate 3, who squints so abo- minably, apparently from the concentration of his energies on his patient's ease, is another present- ment of a Chinaman, droll even in his serious busi- ness. Some symptom is evidently perplexing him, such as some aberration of the " five elements ;" for it is his principle that for the practice of medi- eine "you do not want to lknow what is inside a man." His echeme of the human frame, which would amiuse our exact anatomists, is not indeed calculated to assist him much in the latter respect. Therethe heart of man is placed where the well-rege- lated Chinese mind thinks it ought to be-in the centre of the body, and the other organs range themselves round it, like Ministers of State attending on their Sovereign. The consequence is, thatit is not easyfor the foreigner to understand theCChinese prac- tice of medicine, though he sometimes takes its pre- scriptions to the extent of 150 pills a day, or in doses which equal the size of " half-a-pound of moist sugar." Some of the physicians, nevertheless, have a great celebrity, and the Archdeacon himself pro- fesses to have no mean Idea of their skilfulness. "It would not be safe," he says, " to oompsre it with the advanced state of the scienceamonoWestern nations, but their doctors are decidedly skilful, and, what is more, successful in their treatment of many complaints." They sometimes cure coi- sumption, and even mental derangement, and at all events have so much confidence in ther own powers that they stipulate for fees conditional on the patients' recovery.
			We conceive that the Chinese Cruikshankwas him- self sensibleof his joke, whenhesketched theBuddhist Priest, who comes next to the grave physician, while the Archdeacon himself, with the innocence of his cloth, describes the crafty-looking caitiff as a special phenomenon. NVe are told of his conventual life, of his regular chanted services, of his abstinence from meat, of his shaven crown and his loose robe, as if they were Chinese novelties. " He wil frequently leavevwith any wvhom he finds more susceptible of re- ligious impressions, some charm, some little scraps of yellow paper, which are thought to be influential in the unseen world, fulrnishing a victicuzm for the for- tunate posessor;* he will leaves stinng of holy beads, or a manual of devotion." WVe are told, also, that he visits alike the houses of the rich and poor, but usually brings the artiDlery of his argnments to bear upon the wealker sex. He practices self-torture, and occasionallymutilation. "IT remember," says the Archdeacon, " to have seen a priest with two fingers which had been burnt down to the second joint in the flame of a candle, and on my looking horrified and expressig my surprise that he could have endured so much agony, " Oh," he said, " it was hardly any pain at alL I first tied the finger, so as thoroughly to numb the extre- rnity, and then gradualy burnt it away." " Here is genuine Chinese character," says the innocent commentator, not remembering the pilgrim whojud&amp;- ciously beoilal his peas as a preliminary to his pilgrim- age. At the same time he tells us that the influence of B1uddhism is now on the wane, and that priests of earnest mind will often heave a sighover the degene- racy of the age. Some future Archdeacon will pro- bably encounter this Buddhist itinerant distribut- ing Tracts for the Times, and will commend this also as another Chinese trait to our observation.
			2The Collector of Refuse Hair, who follows the priest, is clearly a more national product; for though the hair of Chinese men and women does not differ very perceptibly from horse-hair, though little of it is worn by the male sex, and though no Chinese indulge in the refinements of exchanging hair as pledges of affection, yet the Chinaman ig often dependent for his tail upon the labours of this ollector, and without his aid the Chinawoman vwould be generally at a loss for the butterflies' wings of hair, with which she ornaments her bead-dress when she makes her grand toilet.

			Scraps, employed by a company of scholars to collect bho shreds of manuscripts, which -we treat so pro- Fanely, is another Chinese character, and a greater curiosity still, if we may credit the statement the. the sole objecb is to destroY them, with sufficient reverence for any sacred words which they may iappen to bear.

			CO.lYFE.SP OAW of the LUTOW WIF IIUEBDEBE_t?.
			BEDFORD, TuEsDA_y.
			The following is the confession of Joseph Castle, who
			nurdered his wife near Luton in August o last year, and who v,rs execated at Bedford on the 31st of March. The statement was mado in the presence of his mother and brother and of the governor and chaplain3of the prison, and was yesterday laid before the public by order of the 11nh Sheriff
			"The murder did not take placo in the dcell-hole; it was lono on the aide of the road where the struggles were stated
			to have taken place. (HDere he showved hew he attacked hs
			ife, whihch was by potting his right arm round the back of bar neck&gt;, and placing his right hand over her monoth, and then said):-It wias In this position it wsas done; I done ft with mDy left hand. A\ short interval elapsed after I gave aer the first wou3nd. It wias done from here to here (passing is fingers from his ear to his throat). As aeon as she found he was wounded she said, ' ll punish yon !' She was tanding np at the time I did it. I seized hold of her theo second 'is'e, and entered the knife under the ear, and, threst it in the direction of the windpipe. As soon as abs
			had received the second wound she said ' Joe, yoe havae done it at last.' I do not know what else she said. She walked towards the dell-hole, and she there tembled In - she was not dragged. I saw her in the dell-hole, on her knees, in the atutude of prayer. with both hands lifted up towards Heaven. When I left her she was alivo in the dell- hole. I did not Imow her fingers were cut, nor do I know how my own fingers got ant." In answer to r. question from his mother, " Did you bring the knife l" he an- swerea. after much solicitude, " Yes."'
			The eoloewing statement was miade to the governor and chaplain after the culprit's relatives had left -
			" I brought the knife vith me in my trousers pocket. I did not iteand doing anything of the kind. She had net a, chance to get away. If she had only sald 'Have mercy on me,' I sbould not have done the deed. I was afraid sho would have me punished, or I should not have done it. She said ' Joe, let me clobe, and do no more; I'll go all the wvay with you, and not punish you.' She wore her shaw4 higher that morning round her reck. I never saw her wear it so high before; it was very high up her neck. It was cur through. I did not think she was killed when I left her. I did not place the knife in the field. I threw ib there from the road." On being asked by the chasp
			lain if she cried out, he said, " Sho conld not; my right armu was round her neck, and my hand wvas on her month, which prevented her. I then began to saw with my left hand. My wife left Ware on Munday morntng, the 5th of August. After she had been gone about three hours S started to the Hartham Railway Station, in Hertford, in pursuiit of my wife, but, finding she u-as not there I went; to the Hatfield Station, thinking to hear something of her tlere. Not having beard of her I proaeeded to Cromer HIyde, at whbich place I heard that my wif'e (according to the description I gave of her) had been there and had gene o'n to baron. I walked on to Luton, and arrived there at about 1O'clock the same night. I thooghtthey were al
			gene to had, so I did not distulrb them, but intended toa sleep in a plait dye-house belonging to my father-in-law. Shortly after I heard somb one at the door of the house oing in. I went out of the plait-house and walked up to the door, thinking it was my wife had just arrived. I lalc' hold of the person, but, finding the voice was not hers, I let ber go and ran away. I walked round tho tonwn two or three times, and asked a policemun for a night's lodging. I then returned to the plait-house, and remained thero thes whole night, and until 7 o'clock the nart morning. When I left the plait-house I went to my father-In-law's house, and
			filnding the deer on the latch I walked into the hoes2 and1 asked Emiy if her father was at home. She replied that he was not, and au the same time, requesting her to allow mev to sit domWn, w ouhich I did, I ancd lir if Jane, my wife, waS there. She said she wFasin had. I asked her permission to go: upistairs,which I did,'and found mywifeinher mother's bed.' Some one of the fansily came to me shortly afterwanrds t n.
			told mote toet np-I could notslop there. Ater some perana..
			eion frem thiem, and threatening to throwd me out of bed, E got up, altholgh against my will, feeling very tired, having walked from Ware to Lutaon, and aving walked 1O milcs in addition the previous morning in quest of work-in aUi net less than 84 miles, and without having anything to cat. rn
			got out of bed about 9 o'oleck on tho Tuesday mofrnlnge dresed mysel, and came downstairs. I found hrdakfas
			ws asver. I sat downn about an hour, and had anipe oi- tobacco before leaving the house, about 10 o'clock thuS- morning. My wife had seine brea^d and pork, wihich she ate in my company. My wife afterwaxrds urged me strong? to leave Lusten, and promised to go parti of the v.a. with me. I tald her I would drop downn dead and dli
			of starvation before I would leave her behind me in Luton.' Mty wife atill pressed me to leave Luton, and at last I un- willingly consented, she promising to accompany me part oi2 the way. Before we left one of her sisters said, ' If I wverq you I wvould get a divorce.' In reply my wife said, 'HEneej can I get a divorce ? It wants money, money, girl.' Aftng. leaving her father's house we entered into conversation, ax she told me she was ashamed of me. I asked her if she thought she was doing ber dnty in saying she was asbamed of her husband. I told her I mneant ber to leavo Waro it ma week or two, when the Mlilitia came out. Sh reminded ma they were coming out on the 9th of September. I saidc "You are wonderful particular in finding it out.' I asked her if sho would live with me again, for the way in whicei we were living made sue sick of life and I told her so. SLei said, ' If you are, I am not.' She repeatedly upbraided mil for coming after her. I asked her why she had left me i
			that sly manner. She said it hed been planned a week. B told her if I had intended to run away from ber I wonld havd told her and wrould have aoled more straightforward. I then' asked her again if she would livo with me. She said, 'Iami afraid.' I told her she need not bo afraid. I held up myi hands and said, ' I hope they may wither if ever I lift npO my hand against you again.' I asked her to kiss me. Sh would not do so. I then kissed her cheek. We walLed= close together across the fields along the footpath beyonda the Model Farm leading to Summeries Cattle. I put m j arm round her waist to help her up the hill, and said to her.
			s'11 carry you up, tired rs I am.' We waLked together to the top of the hill (she being an my ri-ht side), when shd said to me, ' Sorely you cannot want me; * ou hava -' mother who can do for you.' On this I withdrew my aond J he u mediatndy dagged behind me, aud kept uttering somei waords wvhlsh I did net understand. I did net speak to her. for some yards after I took my arm from her waist. I stopped in the way while alas came up to ma. She walklced then on my left side. I then put my left .arm round her waist and endeavoured to kiss her, hut she did notaseme willing. I still kept my arm round her waist walking along the road, nntil we came near to the place where I after- wards heard she was found. I then asked her again if sh, would live with me. She sald in reply, 'lYou dn't want me.' I said, ' If I had not wanted you I should not have' come so many miles after you.' I made no more proposia tions to her and cared no more for life, as life seemed is1 burden to me. I then laid hold of her (she being then oee the side next the bank) and kissed her there. The deed then wvas done as I have previously related. Dated the 30I of March, 1860.

			WEDNh EDAY EVENYGM.
			Tins has been aettling day inConsols and the mar- ket opened at an improvement of an eighth, owing to a belief that several amounts would have to be bought back by speculators who have been operating for a fall, but although that impression proved correct to a certain extent, the firmness of tone was zoon lost, and a rovival of the demand for money in the discouut market increased the tendency to reaction. Prices, therefore, closed heavily, and would, perhaps, have been further depressed if the fact had been known before the termi- nation of regular business that the New Vic- toria Six per Cent. Loan, which was tendered for ~during the afternoon, had virtually resulted in falure, less than two-thirds of the amount havlng been subscribed, althouah the minimum was found to be as low as 105. Consols for money were first quoted 94. to L, and the last bargains were at 94k to -a. lor the account the price was 94a to i A vances on Consols were obtainable in the Stock Exchange at between 3L and 4 per cent, but at the .anktheappllcationswere extraordinarilynumerousI and many persons anticipate that a movement to 5 p cent, may to-morrow be resolved upon, although much of the pressure was perhaps artificial, and attributable to the prevalence of this idea. What- ever maybe the cause of the demand, as the absorp- tion of funds on account of revenue paymen'ts is now at end, the Bank will be plainly justified in putting their rate to any point at which they may consider they vwil get custom. So long, however, as the joint-stock banks and discount houses follow the Bank of England by advancing to a corresponding ex- tent their allowance for deposits, there can be little expectation that an enhancement of the rate willl have much effect in checking any overtrading that may possibly exdst.

			*l'he continental exchanges show generaf firmness. The tenders for the 2,650,0001. Sim per Cent. Debentures issued this year by the colony of Victoria for railway purposes were opened to-day. The offers-about 400 in number-were read seriatim, the great majority being at prices between 105 and 1064k. There were a few exceptional applications at 95 to 9G (probably intended for 105 to 106), 107, and ;ne at 108. The sealed paper containing the mini- murn was then opened, and the rate was announced to be 105. The tenders at and above that figure amounted to only 1,570,0001., and those beiow to 116,0001. There remains, consequently, 1,OSO,0001. or 40 per cent. of the proposed total of 2,650,OOOI. un- allotted. On the Stock Exchange the quotation of the New Debentures this afternoon was, for a short time, -r premiuim, but upon tle full particu- lars becoming knowrn a declined ensued to 104W to 105. This result, it may be hoped, will have the salutary ef'ect of convincing colonial and other borrowers that if they have any desire to maintain the credit of their securities they must not fall into the supposition that because they can float a mode- rate quantity on the London market at good prices the demand is of such a character that they may launch into unlimited expenditure, in the confidence that they wlll always be welcomed to whatever extent they may see fit to invite subscriptions fro2n us.
			The large amount of Mexican doilars brought by the West India steamer has been disposed of at 621d. per oz.; showing a decline of id per oz. from the price re.liz.ed for those by the last packet, anid of id. from that obtained for the limited amounts re- ceived meanwhile. The bar silver has not yet been sold.
			The followingrelates to tle new Stamp Act. The vriter correctly contends that it is not the function of the Board of Inland Revenue to interpret Acts of Parliament levying new taxes, and that the com- mercial comminityshould insist upon points in doubt being referred to thelaw courts, by whom alone that power can be exercised. Looking at the sums p aid to the legal personages employed by the Government, it is disgraceful that Acts relating to Ihe simplest tiscal matters are rarely drawn up in "a manner to be intelligible even to the most ex- perienced persons:-
			"London, April 10.
			" Sir,-Tne correspondence between the manager of the ondon Joint-stock Bank and the Secretary to the Treasurv, which a ppears in your imprension of this day, induces mae to trouble you in the hope of calling of pnblic attention to tho very loose way In which the secent Stamp Acts have been drawn, and to the irregularity which has arisen from ?1his laxity. I refer to the practice of calling on the secretary 'to the Treasury to interpret the obscure phraseology of the Parliamentary draughtsaen. The Court of Exchequer is {he proper tribunal to determine the meanin,g of an Act of Parliament, aot the Board of Inland Rlevenue, which h.as avrery natural disposit(on to decide that the applicant must pay the maximum7 charge. As we have, unfortunately, no Chamber of Commerce to counnanicate with the Go- vernment regarding thls and similar Acts, it would bo advisable that the London Committee of Bankers should have a case stated for the opinion of ths Courts upon the several points In doubt. The present state is moot intolerable; great uncertainty
			evails,sandthesme practice hardly obtainsatany two differeat banking-houses To take one instance, there are many checks in circulation drawn by persons in London en their bankers in London upon the usual printed form, Inst with the words ' or order' inserted instead of ' orbearer.' These checks go, perhaps, to the Continent, and are remitted book to London with a foreign endorsement. Some bankers have refused to paythe checks in this state unless in addition to the penny stamp they bear the ad vatorem stan,p of Is. per cent., as they believe them to be included under the fol. fowing clause of the schedule of the Act -' bill of exchange, 1anught, or order (foreign) drawn or endorsed out of the United Kingdom for the payment of money on demand.'
			Otherbankerscontend,with morereason,tbatacheck drawnin I Lundon on London can hardly be called a foreign draught
			and that, as the clause endorsed abroad only applles tof eign draughts, the words being ' bills of exchanne, draught, or order (foreign),' the ld. stamp is sufficient. The cause has, accordin" to its construction, no precise meaning, for it is Imposs0bTe to endorse a bill for the payment of money on denand if it has been drawn at a different date; but the Iramer probably meant ' bill of exchange, draught, or order (foreign), for the payment of money on demand, dravn or endorsed abroad.' The result of the variance of opinion is that, while some hankers require the ad vaiorem btnmp, others (and amog the number one of the largest of lthe jointistock banks) refuse to attach more than one
			senny, naturaly .userting that the checks in question are certainly not foreiUn draughts.
			" There is one ethcr point which has been raised under tho Act to w;hich I shonld wish to draw public attention, though I fear that tam trespassing at unwarrantable length on your space. It arises under clauee 1; bnt,althoueh per- baps the most obscure cluse in the w;hole Bill, in this par- ticulsar instance I believe the meaing to ho clear. This clause recites that ' the stamp duties now payable in the United Kingdom for or in r- spect of the several instruments, matters, and thin"s mentioned or described in the schedule tO this Act aunexe, whereon other dutios are by this Act ,ranted, shatl re- spec.tively cease and detem aine, and shall be, and the same are hereby, repealed.' It ha^s been sought to make biUsldrawn in London and pAayabl o heoncthe Continect on demand liadle to the ad rNoorehe duty under the claue oef the schedule before quoted-viz., ' bil of xexhaugs, draught, or order (for-eign), drawn or en- dorsed out of the United i ingdom for the pay- ment of money on demand.' These hills have hitherto only been drawn on Penny sbtmps, and I think thaet on re- dection, it witU he obvious that the clause in the schedale does not apply to them, and that the daty consequent'y is unaltered by this Act, ani they re incl,uded in clsase 1 of tho Act nlder the words, 'No other duty is by this Act granted.' I think that it is obvious that the caseso in tho schedale does not crapriso them ; they are drawn in Londen and not out of the Unlted Kingdom, sad they ore not nccos- narl'y endorsed abroad. But even if a foreign endorsement be attached, it cannot surely &amp;&lt; to this class of blils that thme clause in the schedule is meAnt to aopiy, for in that ca5e you compel the draw er to aff,ix thea. sialorcm stamp only in the event of a contingency over wvhich he has no control. };or exampie A drawvsabillon Paristn favour of B; iE B3 undorse the bill in Eondon, A need only afi a Peuny stamp as the bill will be neither drawn nor endorsed a3broad *but iE 1B endorse the bill in Paris, A must affix the ad ralorem stamp. hoe is A possibly to know what B means to do with the bill? how, then, can ron^ in England impose a duty the paymuent of which is only necessay if a third party, probably a foreigner, do some act with the bill after It has left En hlsh Jcrisdiction,ssad of the perfermanre of which Act the draw er In En.la,nd, who is the party liable for the duty, cannet possibly have any cognflzance? Yet
			this is the only clause which can in any way be made to bear upon bills drawn in England for the
			yment on the Continent of monevon demand. I therefore beleve that the words " (forelgn) dr;wn out of tho United Kingdom" were expressly inserted to exclude these bills ; but, as there are eomle who entertain a deubt on the eubject, If yen conld prevail en the Cemmittee of Bankers to obtain an athoritative explanation of the clause ywou would confer a great benefit on the public.

			STATB OF TRADE.
			iLETUESTER, A-man ll.-The hosiery trade is quiet this week, the severity of the weather and thc Eamter ho!ydays having oeVrated against business. The demand for cotton goods has beenx checked. At Hinckley andl Loughborough there is a fair amount of business doing, and very little stock remains in the hands of the imanufacturers. Wools continue firm, and high figuires are yet obtained for supgrior sorts. Yarns are without much alteration.
			NOTTRDgGRAb, 11lTc.-There has not been much doing in the lace trade this week, the Easter holydays having in- terfered with bussnes generally. There is also a return of unseasonable weather, which' will also, to come extent, cheek the demand for the home market. M,ost branches continue quiet ; the fancy department is dull, and for plain goods the demand has not increased. lu silk lace there Is no material change to report. EStockrs of most kinds of goods are light, and manufacturers are making as little As possible while trade continues in so languid a state. The hosiery trade has been quiet this week, the holydays having inter- rupted business. The cold weather is Also prejudicial to trade. Howvever, good workmen are pretty well employd Thase is no material change In the price of yarns.

			Tho railway-market opened favourably, but sales were soon pressed, on the expectation of an advance to-morrow in the Bank rate, and a general decline took place, the movement being stimulated by the late rise.

			WREA INwG BY RLECTRO-MAGNBT.7SM.
			Year after ywear has science labourea, anxd stil lbours, ati subiecting to its control and utilizing for the daily wants of man the wrayward powers of electrlcty. The subtle, though universal fdldd has been sought for investigation in the most secret of nature's areana, where for a long time we were only able to perceive its presenco and darkly define thoso laws under which its influence seemed to reign almost omnipotent throughout creation. To wrest the sezrets of this vital essence from natuxre, to imprlson its tremendous porers, or only leave it free to do tho behests of science, has been the hope of the 19th century-the aim for which our philoso- phers think, our chynmists, meehanists, and eleetricincs toil, Nor have thelr efforts been in vain, though, great as are the results they have accomplished, they are still justly beleved to be but a tithe of what may be expected hereafter. Year after year has witnessed some fresh triumph over this the greatest of all nature's motive principles. The philosophic toy of one year has emerged into the great discovery of the next, and rlpened beforethe third was past into the went of the age. The great step was taken in the discovery of the electric telegraph, and this again developed electrotyping, which Eiklngton and others have rendered such a beautiful and important branch of our mauufaotures. The Government are now about to illuainate our coasts and headlandsby mR1e3ns of electricity, and already from the South Fore- land flashes an elecotri light which breaks the gloom of Oven Channel fogs. Each of these inventions marks a fresh inroad on this almost unknown domain of nature, and we are yet In hopeful speculation as to what may be done in time. Though not of those who believe in the de- velopment of an electro-motive power, yet are we glad to know that thoughtful men and able heads still work towards tbhe attainment of that end-the philosoher's stone of the 19th century. Nevertheless, as to the researches after the old philosopher's stone our greatest chymical discoveries are due, so many our electricians of the present day light on trnths and laws in magnetlsm, to which in im- portance an olectro-motive power would be as nothing. Thus Oersted showed the identity between magnetism and electricity, Faraday proves the truth of the induction, and now M. BoneUi steps for ward with a practical applica- tion of the discovery to the art of weaving-an application which, when fally developed, must exercise the most im- portant influence on tho trade and manufactures of all Europe. lVe don't intend to take advantage of th;s occa- Sion to inflict on our readers a summery of the his'ory of weaving from the timo when the Egyptians first threw the shuttle tiUl Jacquard superseded the old machines and " draw boys, " to have his loom in turn improved upon and superseded now in our day by the invention of the Chevalier Bonelii. This much we may say, that all textile fabrics of every kind, whether in silk or diaper, depend for their markings or designs on the order in which certain numbers (according to the patterns) of the longitudinal threads of the warp are raised and the sUlk contained in the shuttle or weft worked in between them, In the old machlues the weaver worhed with his feet a different treadle or lever for each set of threads he wished to raise, and, as this took up far too much space, It was found necessary to give him the aid of a " draw boy," who read off the pattern and raised such sets of the threads as the weaver himsclf had no treadle for. Jacquard, under the encouragement of the First Napoleon, knocked this systemi to pieces by the Invention of his loom, and received, therefore, that customary amount of obloquy, migrepresentatIon, and ill- usage which the age generaly inflicts on its chief bene- factors in these particulars, In full mastery of his subject, he swept away aU details connected with theo work of the draw-boy, and made the loom, to a certain extent, self- acting. To this end the pattern of the design was pricked on large perforated cards, which went in an endless chain round a roller iu the centre of the loom. All the threads of the warp were connected with bars in the upper part of the loom, and these by a movement of the weaver's treadle were pushed against the perforated cards. Those which faced the pattern holes, and therefore corresponded vith them, remained there, and so, w,hen the lever was lowered, held up the threads wvhich ouglit to hare been raised ead aUowed the shuttle to weavo in the weft or pattern between.
			LfIS maemne wes an immense improvement on the old ffair, yet, though always continuing tho best, it had its own peouliar drawbacks. Thus, 3 pa'tern for a damask- cnrta:n or tablecloth of a rich or elaborate design, we will say, required from 20,000 to 25,000 cards ! To produce these occupied men from two to four, six, or even eight months, according to the greater or less intricacy of the design, and cost from 1201. to l60, As a matter of courso, therefore, designs were mado as simple and plain as possible, were not often changed, and never until the trade would no longer take them.
			M. BonelLi at once sets aside aRl this, by the use of eleetricity. The little bobbins or bars which hold up the threads of tho warp in the Jacquard loom he makes into elee- tro-magnets in tne usual way. The design is painted on a sheet of tinfoil, with the portions not used In the pattern covered with a non-conducting varnish. The pattern passes slowly over a roller under an immense number of brass teeth, communicating by fine insulated wires with the bobbins, the pattern, of course, being in connexion with one pole of a battery, and the bob- bins, or magnets, with tho othor. 'Inus, as the tinfoll slowly moves round, the parts which are not to be worked, being covered with a non-conducting varnish, transmit no current through the brass teeth to the bobbins. The pat- tern, or exposed portion of the tinfoil, on the contrary, does so, and transforms the bobbins into electro-moguets, which attract and hold the bars opposite their points attached to the threads of the warp, which, as the lever descends, the bars are thus held up for the instant, and, of course, rais- ing their threads below, and allowing the shuttle to be passed between.
			This is merely a very rough end general outline of the old end new plans. The latter, however, is far too important to be thus disposed of in a few words. What we have alreadysaid will, nevertheless, assist our readers to comprehend the de- tails of this most valuable improvement. The electric loom, as it is termed, was invented in 1854 by the Chevay Lier Bonelli, of 'MLan, and *director of the Sardinimn teLegraphs. The first machine, constructed at Torin, was afterwards modified by M. liipp, at Berne, and, though It demonstrated the possibility of weaving by means of ele-= tro-magnetism, it, nevertheless, left much to be desired with respect to the success of its practical application, It was not until lS59 that success in perfecting the machinery and in rendering it available for either hand or power-loom weav- ing was attained. To fuUly appreciate aU the advantages which this application of electrlcity to the manufacture of woven material must produce, it is necessary always to keep in mind the long and costly operations which, as we have said, are now incurred efeoro commencing weaving in one or two colours.
			Firstly, then, in weaving by the old machine we must remember the design is drawn on paper divided into a multitude of little squares, the horizontal series re- presenting the weft, or pattern; the cross or short series, the warp, or substance of the materiaL woven. Secondly, the design must be " read,"-that is, the punches of the stamping machine, which are equal in number to the small squares of the pattern, must be arranged so as to perforate the cards, which, as -we have shown, form the basis of the present Jacquard system, Each of these operations must bo repeated as many times as there are horizontal lines in the design (which merely represents one thread of tho weft), as there must be as many cards as there are wefts or cross-threads in a pattern. Lastly, all the cards must be sewn together in the order of their succession. We have already shown how in the " Jacquard " these pierced cards act on the pins of the loom and determine the raising of the threads of the warp or basis of the material beneath. M. Bonelli's looms instantly ac- complish aU this work we have been describingb ith an exactitude that couiLd never bo obtained from the " cards," which, as our readers will easily understand, were almost incapable of producing a very complex pattern. It is by passing the thread of the weft over or under the thread of the warn that the design, either in one or many colours, is produced. The design in M. Bonei's plan is traced on a sheet of tinfoil, the pattern remaining in bright metal, while all the rest is painted over with a non-conducting varnish. The metal pattern thus becomes the conductor of the electricity, the varnished portions do not. This thin sheet of tinfoil is placed on a roller, which revolves it by very slow degrees, with an uniform movement, under a metalic comb. This comb contains teeth equal in numbsr to the pins of a Jacquard loom (from 400 to G00), each of which is most carefully insulated from the next, and each connected by a fine wire with a small electro-ma_met or bobbin. A wire from a small Bunsen pile Is connected with this comb andl electro-magnets, the other wire with the tinfoil design. When by the ordinary move- ment of the Jacquard looni, effected by the foot of the workman pressing the treddles, the loom moves, the metaUic comb lowers Itself, and comes in contact with the tinfoil sheet of the design. The teeth of the comb toucsh- ing on the varnished portions of course stop the passage of en electric current to the bars with which they commeni- Cate, and which In fact, therefore, remain mere bobbbis. All those, on the contrary, which touch the metallic parts of the sheet (the design in fact) allow the current to Pass 'to the electro-magnetg, which instantly become active and capable of attractlng little horizontal bars of iron, which are arranged with their points towards the magnets in a frame common to them all, These magnets, therefore, which are active at
			Once attract and retain the bars as the frame, all by a simple mOvement, in a second moves a lttle back an�- lowers, and thus the threads of the warp below, which rer attached to crodhetoneedIaj hanging on to the magnetizea bars, are ralsed, and the shuttle with the weft of the pattern thread passed in between them. There is a little mechanical contrivance employed to giva solidity to the arrangement of the barn-a solidity which is necessary, as the magnetized bars have to actr upon the needles of the loom, and keep them and their threads sus- pended. Such are the chief features of thls electro-nsynetfo weaving mschine, which, apart from it, scientific merlts, contains, in addition, some most admirable mechanical contrivances. Such, for instance, is the Ingenious means by which the desizn shest moves w,ith a seced: variable at wiUl, and elther backwards or forwards, and' the addition of a little brush to clean the comb. This last, at each motion of the loom, sweeps across all its teeth to prevent the injurious action of the dust, which falling upon the surface would sooninterfere with the a.ction of the electric fluid. The loom which we have now described is only applicable to staffs of two colours-that I3 to say, of one colour upon one general ground. But a loom capable of weaving stuffs of six, eight, or ten colours only differs by the addition of a nost simple piece of mechanism, thus :- Each of the different colours is insulated from the other, and along them on the pattern the pole of the battery slowly passes as the weaver works the machine with his feet, transsmitting the current to each colour in the order in which they occur. Thus, of course, the cur- rent Is sent through the comb to the electro-magnets, which raise the threads of the warp below, where the weaver has his colour shuttles arranged in the order in which they are to be used, and throws them in accordingly. So the loom just as easily, and on the same principle, transmits the pattern to a staff of 12 colours as to that of only two. It is in this that the weaving by electricity displays its superiority over the present system, according to which, for example, if a material is to be worked in six colours, it is necessary by the Jacquard loom to employ six times more cards than fora similar designof one colour. Tho advantages, therefore, which ought to result from tho intro- duction of the electro-magnetic loom in the manufacture of all our patterned fabrics are sufficiently apparent. A new method, which does away with all the operations necessary to the preparation of the cards must, of course, produce an all-important saving of both timo and money upon the present systenm of manufacture. But there are Other and not unimportant advantages, such, for instance, as permitting all manufacturers to try the effect of new patterns without going through the long and costly process of pre- paring cards. le can ascertain in a few hours the effect of any design, and prepare a series of specimens forthe approba- tion ofthe t-adebeforecommencing uponasingl0yardofstuff- In short, whatever can be done by printing, lithographing, or engraving can be thus stamped on tinfoil and repro- duced in coloured silks, according the colours of the original, with aU the fidelity of an Elkington electrotype. By this means, at a triling cost, families can have special deslgns, such as crests and initials, for carpeting, curtains, furniltur
			covers, &amp;c., at a week's notice. In thius loom also tho work- man is enabled with the greatest facility to effect a rednou tioC of the design by means of varying the speed of the cylinder on wlich the pattern is placed. WIth- out alteration or without touching the design, it can with equal facility make stuffs more or less strong or more or less light, by changing the number of the threads of the weft, and by regulating, in accordance with that change, the speed of the cylinder on which the pattern revolves. Of course any required additional effect can be made, or any part omitted from the design, without at all interferlng with the workman. As a matter of course, the electrical portions of tho invention are capable of application to any loom, and, in fact, occupy at the top of the machine no more space than a smal writing-desk. It Is only the cards and cumbrous acces- sories of the Jacquard loom which are done away with; its mechanical properties are retained, and the electro- magnets can be applied to any. It is expected that with this machine, in nlU very Large or intricate patterns, such as are now occasionally used in silks, a saving of 80t. per cent. in money, and more than SO per cent. in time, will bo g.ined upon the production of simlar designs by the present system.
			The loom has been set up in one of the rooms of tho Elec- tric Telegraph station, Founders'-court, Lothbury, where It is daily at work for those who obtain permission to inspect it.

			LONDON, THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 180,
			The American intelligence which has just reacned 1 this country contains a formal protest from the PREsiDExTr of the United States against the inves- tigation proposed by Congress into his official acts. At the same critical moment a strange chance has brought to light a document which is ikely to exercise no small influence in the direction and formation of public opinion as to the value and stability of American institutions. A New York paper has given publicity to a letter of Lord AACAUTAY, con- taining his estimate of the character of JE;F'ER- SOc', and of the effect of the changes of which he was the author upon the fature destiny of America. It is interesting to see what were the real sentiments of a man who had devoted a studious life and a clear and penetrating intelect to the study of history and the analysis of political institutions on the great experiment in democratic self-government which is working itself out on the other side of the Atlantic. We are repeatedly told that we are about to Americanize our insti- tutions, and this Americanization is represented to us as the greatest of calamities. Others admit the excellence of American institutions, but assert that they are beyond our reach from the difference between the conditions of society in a new and an old country. These questions have become of great importance for the discussion on the coming Reform Bill, and the peculiarly clear and distinct treatment to which Lord MAcAuTAY subjected all things which furnished a theme for his pen will give great assistance to the candid thinker. He being dead still speaks with aU his usual eloquence and clearness, and, as usual with him, in no hesitating or qualifying spirit. On the 23d of Alay, 1857, Lord MACAcAAY writes :-Tbat he has not a hig4 opinion of lfIr. JEzERsusoz; that he never uttered a word indicating an opinion that the supreme authority in the State ought to be intrusted to the majority of citizens told by the head; in other words, the poorest and most ignorant part of society. Institutions purely democratic must sooner or later destroy liberty or civiliza- tion, or both. In Europe, where the population is dense, the effect of such institutions would be instantaneous. America enjoys no exemption from these evils. The time wiUl come when New England will be as thickly peopled as Old England; hundreds of thousands of artisans will assuredly be sometimes out of work. Then the institutions of America, Lord MACAuL,Y thinks, will fairly be brought to the test. The rich will be robbed to feed the poor. We have these critical momenta in England, but the sufferers are not the rulers, and nothing therefore is done which prevents prosperity returning. In America the sufferers are the rulers, and Lord MIACAUsAY thinks that either some CzEsAR or NrAPOLEON will arise, who 'will destroy liberty, or the Republic will be plun- dered by a hungry multitude possessed of power, who will destroy or very greatly injure civiliza- tion.
			Such is an abridgment of this remarkable profes- sion of faith, and from it we can gather that Lord MlAcAriY was no admirer of American institutions,-that he believed them to be founded on a false principle, the working of which might be delayed by physical causes, but which would sooner or later bury the Republic under the ruins of its liberty and civilization; and that here, in England, where no physical cause intervenes to save us, the effects of such a constitution would operate with the utmost certainty and rapidity. This expression of opinion obviously divides itself into two parts,-that which relates to America, and that which relates to England. After all, consi- dering the transitory nature of human things, the prospect of a crisis which is not to take effect till we are considerably advanced in the twentieth c .ntury may not have much terror for the Ameri
			can Republic, which, young as it is, has witnessed the French Revolution, the wars of NMr=oLo~, the upheaving of 1830, and the general overthrow of 1848. Even the most prostrate worshipers of Democracy do not, so far as we know, pretend that it possesses the Divine right which Ausi
			And Russia still claim for the kingly office, and they may not feel greatly disturbed at that which is to come to pass in the days of their great grandchildren. The evils of the American Goveronent do not, unfortunately, require a hundred years to ripen. They are even now fast growing to maturity. Long before New England shall have become as populous as Old England, long before the ruling power in the State shall find itself in the condition of wanting a meal and be driven by indigence to plunder, there is reason to fear that the institutions of America will have run their destined career and been super- seded by something far less specious, and perhaps far less tolerable, than they are. We do not speak of electoral corruption and intii- lation; we know by experience that cor- ruption and intimidation are disorders which, though disgracing and enfeebling, are not mortal; but we do speak of the frightfuUy in- creasing corruption and venality of the Executive and Leegislatures of the different States ; of the tyranny of the majority, which tramples not only on the minority, but on the law itself; of the con- tempt into which the judicial office, held for short periods and elected by a very low franchise, has faUen; and of the utter distrust which the nation itself feels of the ability of its insti- tutions to answer the end and objects of civilized government-the security of property, the protection of individual liberty, and the pure and upright administration of the public revenue. The danger that most nearly besets America is, that those institutions which the fathers of the present generation of Americans believed to be perfect, and praised with an ardour corresponding to their belief, the children of the present generation of Americans should learn to dislike and despise; that the prin- ciple of authority and the veneration for law should be destroyed, and no curb should remain strong enough to rein in the headlong course of democratic passion. If we turn from Lord AlAcAULAY's view of American institutions to the effect of similar institutions on an ancient and established European State, we cannot doubt for a moment the correctness of his opinions. With- out undertaking to predict what may happen in some more advanced period of the world, when machinery shaU have superseded the ruder kinds of manual labour and left to the masses time for the acquisition of know- ledge, we feel sure, with Lord AcrLAALAY, that to place the supreme authority in the State in the hands of the majority of citizenB would produce almost instantaneous ruin. We need seek no other cause than ignorance. The real in- terest of the working man is that capital should be preserved and every inducement held out to its accumulation, because upon that capital he must live. But shortsighted ignorance tells him to waste that capital by Strikes, or drive it away by unfair taxation; he cannot generalize sufficiently to understand that the interest of the poor is identical with that of the rich, and, therefore, that identity affords no guarantee that the property of the rich wiiU be respected by him. A single act of a Go- vernment appointed by and responsible to the poor in the direction of Socialism or a redivision of property would dissolve like an exhalation our gigantic fabric of credit, would close our manufac- tories, empty our workshops, choke up our har- bours with rotting merchant ships, and, while annihilating private enterprise, would destroy the public revenue.
			Happily we are in no such condition, and we are not by any means prepared to say that the coming Reform BilU will reduce us to such a state. It does not propose to give the power of government, as in the case supposed by Lord MAcAILAY, to a numerical majority of the citizens told by the head; but we think that we are authorized to say that it vests the supreme authority in this country in a poor and ignorant, though not in the poorest and most ignorant class. Lord BlAcAuLAY could say, in 1857, that in England the supreme power was in the hands of a class, numerous indeed, but select-of an educated class, of a class which is and knows itself to be deeply interested in the security of pro- perty and the maintenance of order. Shall we be able to say as much after the franchise has been lowered to a 61. rental in the boroughs ? That is the momentous question. Of those who answer it in the affirmative we would inquire whether they are quite sure that the same process which has brought a much higher franchise down to univer- sal suffrage in America may not be found as efficacious in England for the same end. Of those who answer this question in the negative we would inquire how they purpose to govern the country when the supreme power has been placed in the hands of a body which they admit they do not trust. They will probably tell us that their confidence is in those means of indi- rect influence by which the advance of Democracy has hitherto been retarded; in other words, that the safety of the country will depend upon a far wider and more indiscriminate use of the arts of intimidation and corruption; that the dominant class will never learn the secret of its own absolute power, or, having learnt that secret, will feel no disposition to use that power.

			Parliament will shortly have to answer a ques- tion-a question of territory, of possession, of annexation, of partition, of right and prescription -which, however, cannot pretend to a place among the world-shaking subjects of the period. Its importance, indeed, has been attested all this week by the weary limbs, the aching eyes, and the dizzy brains of some ten or twenty thousand metropolitan sightseers, and it has long been felt very sorely in certain high quarters. "What is " to be done with the British Museum ?" It is full to repletion and overflows at every outlet. Sculptures buried for ages in Greece and Asia Minor now suffer a second and more hopeless interment in the crypts; others, fast ar- riving, can get no further than the fafadz; wherever there was a wall it has been lined with a corridor; wherever there was a bit of space outside it has been covered with a new halL As for the books, it is true they are no longer in masses or heaps; but the new Reading- room, with its diverging shelves, has not liberated any part of the building for other purposes. Vast collections in mineralogy, natural history, botany, fossils, and, we have even heard it whispered, in the fine arts, moulder in dark corners and depths beyond human ken. Even in the galleries open to the public the birds and beasts congregate more closely than ever they did in their wcods, their lakes, and their plains; and we believe that if anybody sent a veritable stuffed phcenix, an entire dodo, or an unquestionable griffin to the Museum to-morrow, the trustees could only give it a standing by sending something else downstairs. The difficulty may be sunma- rily said to consist in the MIuseum being intended to take in everything. Its theory is, that if it alone survived the world, its visitors from some other sphere could form a complete idea of this globe and its contents. The building, indeed, iB eminently unfit for the purpose. Though like the " four-cornered man" of the Greek philoso%her,
			and "tower square to aU sides" of the modern poet, it isf more solid than capacious, more substantial than elastic. Time, all has been done that is possible, short of roofing over the court in front and building shelves in the portico. The MIuseum was planned in days when Erectheums and Propylha were in the ascendant, and we may congratulate ourselves that it was not designed in the form of one huge temple. But what is to be done with this family, which carries out even in its lifeless stage the primneval command to increase and multiply ? The contents wage war one against another. The antiquities lie heavy on the ground; 3Nineveh bulls and Egyptian Msnmo.Ns are not easily driven away. As for the books, defendit nmerlnts; and, if some hopes seem to have been built on the locomotive or volatile habits of the natural history collection, it has an army of champions, who defy all the world to violate this vast sepulchre of the animal creazion. Nobody wiU budge; metropolitan ingenuity has exhausted itself in devising compro- mises, equitable arrangements, honourable re- treats, harbours of refuge, and means of escape. The last proposition was to put windows into the Great Eastern, and make it a Noah's Ark for the dead specimens of the Post-Diluvian world. All that is certain is, that something must be done.
			The two propositions that now divide the suf- frages of the scientific world, or, as it is alleged, of the scientific versus the political world, are the extension of the MIuseum and the transference of the natural history collection to the rising suburb of Albertopolis, south of the Kensington-road. In this new region are to be the new gardens of the Horticultural Society, with a winter garden, splendid arcades, and other buildings in cha- racter; and, no doubt, a site and space could be found here for a Museum of Natural His- tory. That is just the situation assigned to this purpose at Paris. As a vast collection is in that neighbourhood already, in the Brompton AMuseum, and the Fine Arts Exhibition is to be somewhere thereabouts, nobody could dispute the propriety of making the birds, and beasts, and fishes migrate to a region so evidently pre- pared for them. This is the view of the question that most naturally presents itself to the anti- quaries and literary gentlemen at the British Museum, whose delight at witnessing such a migra- tion would be equal to that of the Egyp- tians when they saw the departure of the locusts, or the Trojans when they found themselves, as they thought, rid of their obstinate besiegers. But there is no intention of a retreat in this case. A vast array of naturalists defend the citadel of nature, and from the upper rooms of the 'Museum fulminate argiument and rebuke on their invaders below. They appeal to the sacred infancy of the Museum, and the com- prehensive spirit of the founder; to solemn acts of Parliament, and a century of prescription; to the vast multitude and weary limbs of the pilgrims who, as during this week, flock from all the suburbs of the metropolis to this central shrine, but who would wander and perish in the wilderness west of Hyde Park-corner before they reached South Kensington; they appeal to national singu- larity itself, which, by a happy exception to the general use of the word, combines all the collec- tions of science under one Alma Mlater; they warn us that if we divorce the living from the dead, and mind from matter, we shall be plagued with Kensington naturalists who know not how to reason, and Bloomsbury students without eyes to observe. They stand on the intimate and per- petual connexion of the sciences, and the wisdom of showing to the world their mutual dependence and respect. Such is the tone of "AFewReasons why the " British Museum should be preserved in its ancient " integrity, as by law established," which we publish to-day. We are not sure that when our readers find the appeal made to the law and the testimony, to prescription and to national singularity, they will think the cause of Nature and public conveni- ence strengthened by these august alliances. But the real question is one upon which any man of common sense may have an opinion, or may, with- out disgrace, confess himself undecided. It is whether the birds and beasts are to settle in the neighbourhood by an enlargement of the MIuseum, or mirrate to South Kenainoinn.
			if we are to consider the interests of literature and science, the mutual relation of all the departments, and the convenience of officers and readers, it can- not be denied that there are overwhelming reasons for keeping aU together. No doubt, too, the pre- sent site of the collections is as central and con- venient as any that could be obtained. Indeed, for tho Eastern half of the metropolis, by far the most populous, the distance of South Kensington would be a wearisome addition to the journey. The state of the property in the neighbourhoodl of the Museum is very favourable to its en- largement. Property is falling in value there almost as rapidly as it is rising at Brompton. The houses north, east, and west, while they are in good open streets, and in the midst of several good-sized squares, are understood not to bear the value they once did, owing to the continual migration of the occupants westward. At a comparatively small cost the MIuseum could acquire three extensive frontages in spacious thoroughfares, with a great depth of ground. As it is all the property of one nobleman, the reversion might be secured at once, and the enlargements made as they are wanted. There would then be no further question as to space for some generations to come. But then it is said that the interest and convenience of the public do not require this closo concentration, or, rather, this vast accumulation of objects. We suspect that the greater part of the people in this metropolis visit the Museum once in their lives, or, if more than once, once as children and once again in later years. Then they attempt everything. They go the entire round, upstairs and downstairs, generally in a dense crowd of holyday folks. Their sensations are extreme fatigue, misery, and mental confusion. After the first half-hour they become almost inca- pable of the most superficial observation, and roam onwards, looking more like sheep driven through the streets of London under a summer's sun than votaries of science or rational beings. There are millions of objects in the Museum, some thousands of a striking and interesting character. Many require a close view to understand and discrimi- nate. There are miles of cases and counters, and the mere walking up and down each gallery is no trifle, in dust and heat, in a crowd of chil- Iren and their less observant elders, and after a fatiguing journey from the suburbs. In a word, there is twenty times as much as anybody can do justice to in one visit of several hours. If the working classes could be expected to sqpare half-a-dozen days in the course of their lives for visits to 3Museums, then it would be advantageous to them to have as many. WVere the Greek and Roman sculptures, the Egyptian antiquities, the N-ineveh, the Medheval, and the ]Natural History collections, the fossils, the mineralogical collection, the works of medimval art, the books, such as are shown to the public, and some other departments of the present Museum, dispersed in different edifces aU over the metropolis, the people, if they had time, might be induced to give some hours to each of them separately, with more comfort and edification than is possible in a visit to this huge Babel of Science. But, after all, the questions remain, whether the mass of sightseers ever go to the Museum from any other than the merest impulse
			of curiosity; whether, having gone once, they ever care to go again; and whether, therefore, their imaginary convenience, which is supposed to be consulted by scattering the national collections, should be suffered to outweigh the undeniable advantages which arise to scientific visitors-that is, to all who take a real interest in the Mluseum-from having every branch of those collections uncder the same roof?

			The Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, adopted only by the casting vote of its chairman, 3Ir. BAisus, recommends the withdrawal of the Qusm='s Printers' and Universi- ties' patentfor the printing of the Bible. The Report of an equaUy divided Committee will not carry with it much authority, and may be looked upon as no verdict at all. But this is not all that is to be said of this Report. The reasons which it gives for recommending this change are, considering the quantity of actual evidence of fact bearing upon this question, very odd ones. They are principaly the pure sugges- tions of the imagination of the Committee-i. c., of one half of it; they consist mainly of a series of hypothetical " guarantees" for the same accuracy and cheapness of prmited Bibles tnder a system of unrestricted competition that there is under the present one,-" the vigilance of the "public," "the watchful care of the clergy and " ministers," " the special attention of religious " societies," " the criticism of the press," &amp;-c. We haye no doubt that these reasons are very satis- factory to the gentlemen who rely on them, but the remark is unavoidable that there was not the slightest necessity to hear witnesses, collect facts, and sit out weeks of formal inquiry, to find out half-a-dozen vague conjectural securities of this kind, which any one who knew nothing whatever of the subject and had not ac- quainted himself with one single fact of the case could have tossed off without a thought in a minute. This whole ceremonial might have been dispensed with, if all that we are presented with at the last is a speculation which half-a-dozen gentle- men have produced out of their own heads.
			But the Report does not-only ignore facts, but struggles visibly and palpably against them. It admits that the Bible is under the existing system " published at a remarkably low price, and with ccgreat accuracy," but-the common answer- the existing system has nothing to do with this "cheapness and accuracy." And why has it nothing to do with it ? Hlear the sage Report on the article of "accuracy." It is quite plain says the Report, that the existing system has nothing to do with the accuracy of our Bibles, becautse the "patent contaius no injunctioa to " accuracy." For anything the patent contains, then, agpears to be the argument of the Report, the QuEx's Printer may riot in inaccuracies, if he does not, indeed, deliberately prefer them; and it is only a special mercy that he has not exerted his lawful rights, and left at least one word in a page wrong, only to show the public that he has a right " by patent" to do so, and that nobody can preventhim. If, notwithstanding this statutable liberty, he has spelt all the Dukes of Edom correctly, if he has not confounded EZRA with ESDuAs, and JEREniAn: with JEcO.NcA, it is an interposition of Providence. Had the Com- mittee reflected an instant, it would have seen that the particular wording of the patent has very little to do with this question, and that we are concerned here with living facts, and not with a piece of parchment-with the actual workina of an existing system, and not with the formal mode in which a certain document is drawn up.
			WVhat is the state of the case, then, and what is the actual operation of the existing Bible Printing Patent? We have the clear admission of the Report itself that, looking to practical objects, it leaves nothing to be desired. The Report allows the " cheapness and accuracy" of our Bibles; it does not pretend to state that Bibles would be more cheap or more accurate under another arrangement. Its sole objection appears to be to anything in the shape of a privilege as such. But surely the practical object is the main consideration here, and if that is gained we may be excused for a reluctance to abolish a whole existing arrange- ment, which has stood the test of time, merely for the sake of a protest against the theory of privi- lege. There are plenty of practical opportunities for protesting against privileges-for instance, where they are found to work ill,-without a gratuitous collision with one connected with a very peculiar and limited subject which happens to work exceedingly welL The truth is that there is no rule without an exception. It is possible that the general principle of privilege may be wrong, and yet that there may be particular cases in which more would be lost than gained by doing away with a privilege. We mist not follow a principle blindly, but look to the parti- cular case. This is a question in which religious feeling is concerned; it is not a common free-trade question. The religious public would be disgusted at careless editions of the Bible; they would be an eyesore to it; inaccuracies whichwould be overlooked in other books would look like a want of reverence for that book which contained the Divine revelation upon which their faith rested. You are dealing with peculiar material, then, in which a just religious sensitiveness comes in, and it is a fair question whether peculiar safeguards are not wanted to pre- vent mistakes which would touch upon such tender ground.
			But when we speak of privileges, we must re- member what sort of a privilege the Bible-printing one is. It is not a privilege which supersedes competition; on the contrary, it involves the keen- est and briskest competition. Three establish- ments share it-the two University Presses and the Qum-'s Printer. Nobody pretends to say that these three establishments could possibly combine to cheat the public, and keep up high prices; such a policy would be transparent suicide, and the abolition of the privilege would follow, as sure as fate, upon the close of the term of the present patent. As they cannot possibly combine, then, the only alternative is that they compete, and when competition begins it is just as strong between three establishments as be- tween 300. Number does not affect the case. Two men fight each other as desperately as 2,000. If one of these presses lags in the quality and high price of its productions, it as surely loses all its custom as if everypress in every market-town printed Bibles. The existing system, then, has the fullest and freeest advantage of competition, while, on the otber hand, the small number between whom the competition rests is an additional element of cheapness, because establishments can afford to send out their articles cheap in proportion to the largeness of the orders for them. Thus, if you can secure true competition, the small- ness of the number of producers, provided they are able to produce enough-and it is not denied that we have plenty of Bibles-is very far from being injurious to the interest of the public, which gains by the consequent largeness of the establishments which produce the article
			for it, everything being produced more cheaply on a large scale than on a small one. It is9 thus that the combination of competition with privilege has, as a matter of fact, pro- duced the cheapest known books in the whole world of printing. An English Bible is nearly three times as cheap, for its size, as the cheapest edition of the Pilgrim's Progress; it is even a fraction cheaper than the Fantily Herald,
			which sells fora penny, wvith a weeldy circulation of 200,000 copies-an extent of sale vwhich, of course, one edition of the Bible cannot be ex- pected to attain. The pearl Bible sells in sheets for 5Ad.; of this sum the mere cost of the paper, even allowing the drawbackz, takes at least 3Sd., leaving to the printing of the 24 sheets that compoEe it only twopence. A man must be a very insatiable bargainer if -he thinks this a dear artide; indeed, the English Bible is simply the cheapest thing in the world_ There is no article of any sort or for whatever use the price of which bears so small a proportion to the labour which produces it. It is true that some one or two of the Scotch Bibles, printed under a system of competition, are the bares'
			fraction lower in price, but they are not clicatpcr, nevertheless; the superior paper, type, and accu- racy of the English more than compensate for the difference, and transfer the lowness of relative cost to their side. Nothing shows, indeed, the extra- ordinarily low price of our cheap English Bibles more than the fact that in America, where no privi- lege exists, they have actually ceased to print these cheap editions, simply because they cannot be made to pay, and bhy ours, which, with all the extra expenses of carriage, import duty, &amp;c., have a large sale in America. We need hardly alude to other advantages; besides that of ability to send out a cheaper article, which large establishments possess, the superior facilities of correction which a vastquantityof editions, with all their cross-readings, supply, the stimulus of greater responsibility of posi- tion, of more capital at stake, and of larger orders, to bring the article produced to the greatest pos- sible finish. The Scotch Bibles, printed under a free competitive system, have, even with all the advantage of the supervision of the Scotch Bible Board, many mistakes, and are, in point of accu- racy, much inferior to our English Bibles.
			These being the plain and well-known facts ot the case, the one single fact on its own side which this Report is able to produce is, 'that the price of Einglish Bibles descended as soon as the Scotch patent ceased, and the principle of competition was introduced into that country. From this event the Report dates the cheapness and immense issues of the English Bible, and its argiument apparently is, that because this event gave the English sale a stir, that therefore the same event in England will repeat the impression, and make Bibles cheaper stilL They do not say this in words, but if the argument comes to anything it comes to this. But this is a palpable fallacy. The Bible trade sleeps a long time, and the privileged establishments go on with their old high prices. Then comes an agitation in the public mind, and a cry for cheap Bibles. This rises to such a height is Scotland that it ousts the patentee from his seat and throws open the printing of the Bible, under the check of a Bible Board. In England the sti
			leaves the patent untouched, and only goes so fax as to rouse the patentees to greater activity, and make them feel the necessity of supplying the English public with cheaper Bibles. This being the case, the whole merit of the change in the price el the English Bible is attributed by this Report tc the demohtion of the Scotch patent, whereas the demand for cheap Bibles, when it arose and spread, would have succeeded in getting them from the English presses under any circumstances. whether the Scotch patent continued or not. The compe- tition of our three presses would of itself have secured the gratification of the religious public; if Oxford refused, Cambridge would have found it worth its while to accom- modate the country; if Cambridge refused, the }KSG's Printer would have seen that he had al opportunity. The simple state of the case is, thai a demand sprang up then which did not exist, or diid not exist nearly to that extent before. The new arrangement in Scotland was the effect oJ that agitation and demand, and not the cause ol it, and the fal in English prices which followed was a parallel event proceeding from a common, cause. But, if the abolition of the patent in Scotland did lower English prices, what then? Nobody is required to contend for what Englisl patentees and lUniversity Bible Presses have been; the question is what they are now. We are not concerned with the question what the stimulus was, so much as with the question hou that stimulus acted, and what their present energies and relations to the public are. Can you get bettei and cheaper Bibles anywhere than the English! The plain and notorious fact is that you cannot. The existing Bible Presses, then, supply the demands oi the public adequately and fully; there is no faull to be found with them, and therefore nothing tc be gained by superseding them on the foregonc conclusions of MIr. Bm-NEs.

			"The select committee appointed to inquire into the nature and extent of the Queen's Printers' Patent for England and Wales, so far as relates to the right of printing the Hloly Scriptures, and to report their opinion Pas to the propriety of any futuLre grant of that natent, and who were empow- ered to report their observations thereupon, together with the minutes of evidence taken before them, have en- mined the matters to them referred, and have agreed to the following report :
			"1. That exclusive privileges of printing or publishing, the Holy Sxcripturesiae wrong In principle, and are shown by experience to he opposed to the public interest.
			" 2. That until the abolition of the Scotch Bible printing mnonopoly the price of Bibles in Scotland and England
			through the operation of the monopolies in both contres -ery hgh; and that, in consequence of that abolition, the price wsas suddenly reduced about one-half, and the circula Zion of Bibles Immensely increased.
			" 3. That the patent does not appear to have been granted for the purpose of insuring the accurate printing of the =Bible, that it contains no injunction to accuracy, and pro- vides no penalty for inaccuracy; and that, in point of fact, the Bibles printed by the Queen's printers and the Univer- alites contained many errors, until public discussion, and the inquires of the select committee of 1831, led to in- creased care in the printing.
			" 4. That, while the Bible is now published at a remark- ably low price, and with great accuracy, the cheapness and accur-acy have not been the effects of the restrictions on printing, hut of the competition between the Queen's printers and the Universities, and of the free competition in =3cotland in printing the Bible, combined with the great pubhlc attention given to the subject for the last 30 years.
			"I5. That, freedom of competition would be likely to pro- duce and maintain the greatest attainable cheapness, as well as the utmost beauty and attractiveness of typography and
			"d6. That under free printingtbere would be the foUowing ,guarantees for the accuracy of the sacred text, namely,-
			"s.Tevglance of the Christian public.
			"2d. Th acfu aeo the clergy and minister of nll Christian bodies.
			" 3d. The special attention of religious societies esta- blished for the puppose of circulating the Bible.
			"4th. The continual criticism of the press.
			"5th. The knowledge which booksellers must acquire of the merits of dlifferent editions.
			" 6th. The interest of the printers and publishers of the 'Bible, who would suffer a heavy penalty for inaccuracy, by "nding their editions unsaleable.
			"7th. The efforts of the present patentees and the Uni- versities to sustain their reputation, together with the stereotype plates and ether advantages whih they possess.
			"7. Thntthepatent is unjust, in prohibitin the imports. tion of Scotch Bibles Into England, while English Bibles are permitted to be imported into Scotland.
			" S. That the patent creates a monopoly much more ex- tensive and stringent than the patentees have ventured to enforce - it gives an exclusive right to print ' aU and sin. gularBi6les and New Testaments whatsoever, in the English tongue or in any other tongue whatsover, and any transla,
			tion, with notes or without notes,' and also to prevent the introduction of Bibles printed In any other part of the king- dom Into England and Wales ; but the patentees have not exercised their legal right of preventing the introduction of Bibles from Scotland, nor of interfering with the publi. cation of the Bible in other languages or translations, or accompanied with not-es or references, hut have practically restricted themselves to the issue of the Bible, without note or comment, and in the authorized version.
			" 9. That the committee recomnmend that the patent of the Queen's printers, so far as relates to the printing of Bibles and New Testaments, be not renewed, and that no exclusive privl ee of printiLng the Sacred Volume be allowed henceforth to exist.

			THE EmIILgroN MURDER.-The inquest on Ann Sewell was resumed, at the Blue Bel Inn, Emble- Ion, on Tuesday, before Dr. Henry Bell, Mr. T. A. Honkins, county magistrate, and r. Densne, Chief-Con. stable for Camberland and Westmorland. The coroner opened the proceedings by reading the confession made by Vass on Good Friday, in the presence of Mr. Dxunne and AMr Waugh, clerk to the magistrates. It was to this effect:-
			"She made memadyou knov, and I was coming from righting the ewe. She was in the passage. comring ot of the front door leading into the ysad, oppoeeto the stable. She wanted me to do something with her nanlkere, and as I woald nst. she began to bother with me, and menls. She had tknife it her hand, which, a I wrestanding between the 3t3bie and tha hoosa door, she threw at me. and the hafe inascatehed me in the lelt cheek. just below the bone. I clicked it up ans mladnets and threw It at the deceased Ann Sewell, and it tauck In the apple of her throat. as she was standing at the edge of the door, and she ran from there u the bottom of the passage. She did not reream out. * Oh. dear.' ahe says, * come here and eat me away slto- 3ether.' She ald she could not find It of her heart togo out again. Vell. then I sid I did not like, and thea she begged of me twice or threetlmestodoit. I tookupanalife which IhAdlIn myhand, and jnst come a atreke acrona the left side of her neck.

			SlXhe confession proceeded to stote that he washed the blood fCrom his waistcoat and hands, after which he returned to bin- work itn the field until he was sunimoned thence by the -announcement that the deceased had killed herself. COss further stated that on the night after the murder he went into Sowell's room and took out of a bag belonging to her
			er purset containing ls. rsd. and a sovereign, and from her frockpocket hall-s-crovwn. On Wednesday he went to Eag,lesfield and paid a debt which he owed to his relatives there with the sovereign, spending the half-crown in drink, and part of the Is. ld. in tobacco. He states that this confession is voluntary, and that he had no necomplice. He killed the deceased about half-past 3, and was sorry after it -was done. AIr.Waugh, clerk to the magistrates, deposed to the fast of this confession being made by Cass in his presence at the police-station, Cockermouth, on the evening of Good Fri- day. Mr. Chief-Constable Dunne stated that Superinten- dent Brown took Cans into custody on Friday by his direc- tion. After the prisoner had been looked un some time he sent for! witness and expressed a desire fo make a state- nuent, before hearing which witness sent for Mr. Waugh, and Cass then made the above confession. Mr. Dunne added that from the inquiries he had made he believed Ealand to bo completely exonerated from any participation in this crtme. Cass was brought in from the lock-up at Cockermouth, handcuffed, and his confession being read to him by MIr. Waugh, he said that the statement was aU true. 'he inquest-room wras then cleared, and on re-opening in a few minutes the jury returned a verdict of " Wilful mur- der against George Ones." On Thursday the prisoner will he brought before the Cockermouth bench on the charge of robbing the deceasedi.
			MNlossml PAnDuL-w n Sr tsmER.-Messrs. Palmer Brothers, the celebrated shipbuiiders at Jarrow- sspon-iT;nc, have nearly completed a monster paddle-wheel steamer for the Royal Mail Steam Company, which Is of _-uch dimensions that when baunched it will be the largest vessel afloat, with the exception of the Great Eastern. She is 370 feet in lengthi and has a depth of 32 feet from the top spar deck. Her width is 40 feet beam, and 71 feet over the paddles. She is provided with three oscillating engines on the waidn shaft to drive the paddles, besides several auxiliary engines giving an aggregate of 800-horse power. She wil

			From Washington we learn that the President had sent In to Congress the official despatches re- ceived from American officers in the Gulf concern- ing the seizure of Spanish vessels by the American squadron off Vera Cruz. They are aa follows
			" OFFICIAL ACCOUNTS.
			"REPORT OF COirtlODoiE Tuaxa.
			United States' ship Saratoga, off Vera Crttz, March 8.
			To Captain Joseph Jarvis, Commanding United States'
			ship Savannah.
			"Sir,-On the morning of the 6th inst. two large steamers appeared off the harbour of Vera Cruz without any flag being holsted, although a gun was fired from the castle and the Mexican flag run up at the same time to induce them to do so. They were evidently confederates, as they were hove to for some time communicating with each other. After several hours, and after communicating with the Spanish vessels of war at Sacrificios, which sent out a boat to them, they stood down the coast in the direction of Anton Lizardo. Yoe directed me immediately to place mv ship in tow of the small American steamers here, the Wave and Indianola, which were placed at your disposal, to follow them and to ascertain their character, where they were from, of what nation, where they fitted out, and what was their object upon this coast. and to report to you the result of these inquiries with all practicable despatch. In obedience to these orders, I left here about sunset in tow of those vessels, on board of each of which I placed a detach- ment of about 35 men and marines, in case they might go into shoal water, where my ship, with her large draught, couldnot follow and communicate with them. The detach- ment on board the Wave was commanded by Lientenast
			o eel R. S. Kennard, of the Savannah, laccompanied by Slid. shipmanWilliam Whittle, jn., of the Preble. That of the Indianola was commanded by Lieutenant Andrew Bryson, of the corvette Preble, accompanied by Master J, N. Miller, of the same vessel, Lieutenant Andrew I. Hays, of the Marine Guard of the Savannah, and Lieutenant Julius E. Meire, of the Marine Guard of the ship. I proceeded dow the coast, making direct for Anton Lizardo, 15 miles distant, where I expected to find them. About midnight two large vessels were reported at anchor at Anton Lizardo. I stood directly for them, and had directed my pilot to anchor me immediately between the two vessels. At the moment when I had nearly reached this point and the tow was cast off, both the little steamers being ahead of me, they hailed, and reported that the larger steamer of the two was under way and endeavouring to escape through the southern passage. I hailed and ordered them to purane her and to get on board, if possible, as I was ordered to communicate with the senior officer, who I sup- posed was on board this vessel. At the same moment I tired a shot ahead of her to bring her to. As soon as they got close to her, which took but a few moments, to my extreme astonishment she opened a heavy fire of great guns and musketry upon them, and it was reported to me at the same time that the other steamer was slipping her cable. I immediately gave her a broasiide, as I had not the re- motest doubt of her being in complicity with and under the orders of the officer of the other steamer ; and I was afraid she would go to his assistance, in which case I should have been obliged to recall my vessels, or to witness their captutre or destruction; and as she had the audacity to fire into me without any provocation whatever I was deter- mined to seize her if I could. They ran up the Spanish flag as soon as I fired. In the meantime the lsr'er steamer was hotly engaged with the forces on board my two little steamers in a running fight. Findlng she could not get out of the southern passage, she Immediately changed her course, put her head to the northward, and passed in- side of me to gain the northern passage, and to keep out of the way of my guns, followed by my vessels, warmly engaged with her all the time. She was evidently too fast for and was gairnig upon them. As she shot ahead ef them, I got agun to bear upon her, and shot away her smoke stack. I found now that it was impossible to fire without danger to my ves- sels, as they were all together. The chase was continued in the midst of a hot fire on either side. I could not but axdmire, at this moment, the daring gallantry of these fine fellows contending with so superior a force. They closed in anand gr wth her in spite of her efforts to shake theoff. i ing it impoesible to escape, I suppse they ran the vessel on shore f alo events, pressed closely by them, she grounded, which I was not aware oE at the time. They were then distant about a mile from my ship, and my anxiety was intense for their safety. I could afford them nov posaible aid. t my three largest catters were inboard and before I conld have manned my boats and get to thenn the affair would have been ended. I wasnot, however, keptn long in suspense, for almost immediately I heard three cheers, and was informed that they were boarding her over the bows, which could ho distinctly seen by our glasses.
			"I now return to the steamer anchored close to m. WhUle the engagement continued between the other vessels, and at the moment that they were passing this ship, the F'irst Lieutenant, who was on the poop, caUled to me to say that this steamer was firing musketry. I directed again a division of guns to be given her, which was done. I t.hen
			alled and ordered the commander on board, saying if he did nt instantly come onboardI would send aguardtobring him. He came on board, and informed me, in answer to my in- quiries, that his ship was the Marquis of Hfavana; that he had been employed by Captain Mtarn, who commanded the other ship, to transport stores and mlunitions of war, and that he was Spanish.
			- in toe meantime i nan sent an otfcer to bring Captain Matnn on board. As soon as he had reached my cabin I asked him how he had dared to fire upon my vessels. He replied unhesitatingly, and In the presence of a witness, that when he observed my vessels steaming into the harbonr he had informed his crew that he was sure they were American vessels of war, and positively forbade them to fire, but that it was a mixed crew of various nations, having been but recently taken on board, and not being yet properly dis- ciplined he found It impossible to control them. I observed to him that It was a great outrage for which he would have to answer, and which he pretended most deeply to regret. All of which I knew to be nntme, because during the action he was distinctly heard calling on his men to heard with him. You will perceive how all this con- dicts with the accompanying depositioas of four of his
			crew. It only remains for me to speak of the force i and armament of these vessels, as far as I have been able to ascertain. The larger steamer, called the General Ilra- mon, carried two broadside, one pivot, andcseveralhowitzers
			wlith a crew of 100 men. I am not positive as to the calibro of her guns. Sopposing that she would follow me yesterday, I expected to have been able to give a more minute account of her, but she is still aground. The Marquis of Havana carries also one pivot and two broadside guns, with aboutt 70 persons on board. Her pivot gun is a heavy 24-pounder. The captain of this last vessel threw overboard large quanti- ties of ammunition, much of which was picked up 'oating in the harbour by niy boats, in chests and kegs. When she was taken possession of her guns were all dismantled and were lying upon the deck by the side of the carriages which I have no doubt was done after the captain founa she was captured, and before I could get a boat on hoard of her. He assumes her to be an nnarmed ves- sel; and her papers of clearance, which I herewith inclose, made out at Havannah, do not speak of her having any gnuns on board. Yet her armament Is such as I have reported it, and there Is not a doubt that the vessel was equipped at lHa. vannah as a part of the force with which Captain Marin was to act on this coast.
			" It now becomes my painful duty to speak of a circum- stance which has occasioned rise the deepest concern and regret. About two hours after the engagement n boat came alongside from the Indianola with a person very badly wounded, dressed in citizen's dress. Upon inquiry I was informed it was General Lave, of the Mexican army. Immediately I had him taken to my cabin. It seems by his own account, as he related it to me, that as I was about leaving Vera Cruz he was sent off to the Indianola by his Government to obtain some information as to my movements, and that in the hurry and confusion in getting and towing out his boat left him. The officers command- ing tbeso vessels had been particalarly instructed bv me to allow no strangers, or other than Americans, to remain on board-no ono but their crews, engineers, and firemen. As these were all strangers, the officer in command conld not distinguish between them and other strange persons on board, and did not know than he was on board nntil he saw him wounded. Immediately on my arrival here I sent him In a cot to the castle, where he now is. This officer, Lieu- tenant Bryson, is not to blame. Hoeknew nothing of his
			om/ing on board or of his being on board, until his condi-I tion disclosed it, when he sent him to me,
			" On our part, Iam glad to bo able to report to yonuthe smnall loss our vessels sustained in this engagement. I have but one man mortally wounded who is still ailve, one seriously, and several slightly. This Isthe mr remark able, as the engagement lasted from a half to three-quarters of an hour, and the firing wras incessant during that time But It most be remembered that it was at night. On the part of these people the loss was much more severe. Twelve were brought on board my ship severely wounded, three of whaom have died. I have sent all the others to the hosnital on shore. The wounds in almost every case being by U6nid rifle bullets are very severe. I should have remained at Anton Liz3rdo until the General Miramon was got afloat, but tVn doctor reauested me to come up at once with tho wounded, whom e said it was impossible to move to any other vesseL
			" I cannot close this despatch, Sir, without expressing my extreme satisfaction with the conduct of al the officers and men of the expedition. My own officers and men, who unfortunately had but a smaU share in the engagement, by their alacrity, activity, and promptitude to obey and execute orders, tanught me to feel with what confidence I could depend onpn them if my ship should at any time bo called on to defend tho honour of our flag. I have already spoken of the conduct of our officers and men on board the Indianola and the Wave. On their part it was a briUiant affair. I have omitted to state that the vessel of Captain Marn caled the General Miramon did not hoist her colours at any time before, during, or after the engagement, and that it was a brilliant moonlight night, when he could have most easily Patisfied himself that the Saratoga could not possibly have been a vessel belonging to any Mexican power or party. I have also omitted to state that the clearance papers of the Marquis of Havana certify to only 33 perrons on board; wbereas I am informed by the officer now in charge of her, that after 30 of them had been removed to our shlp there remained at least 40 stiU on board of her. As this ship was sent immediately hack to asdst In flQating the
			General Miramon I have been unable to make an accurate report of the number of persons on board. About the time the General Miramon was taken a boat escaped from her to the shore, said to contain officers of General hiTramon's
			arThe statement which I have herein submitted to you of all the important details of this affair wil be testified to by ever officer of the expedition.
			"Ihave the honour to be, Sir, very respectfully,
			"Your obedient servant,
			" T. TURNER.
			"P.S.-As every effort awiD be made by the parties who have been suffered to misrenresent the facts of this affair I have desired to be as accarAte in my statement as possible. I have said that the Gener-al Miramonhad00 men on boa.. I removed from her 50 men before leaving Anton Lidardo, who are now on board my ship. But It is possible that I shall never know what number of men she had on board, as some escaped ina boat to the shore just before she was boarded. There may have been more, there may have been less, than 100 on board. I havesaid that the pivot gcn of the Marquis of Havanr was a24-pounder; it may have een a 32. I do not wish to overrate or underrate the armament of these vessels. On my arrival here from Anton Lizardo my slip nfortunately grounded In the bay, and I wis aU day endeavouring to get her off. I had no time to give mY attention to anything else. That vessel left the next morn- ing at daylight, since which, by a gale of wind from the north, I have been cut off from oth these vessels. I here- with enclose depositions of the first-lieutenant, of the purser, of the orderly sergeant, and of the marine guard of this ship, who were all in the poop during the action, as to the fact that the Marquis of Havana fired musketry during the engagement; and also the certificate of Reuben Applegate to a conversation with the engineer of the Marquis of Havana, who died of his wounds. I find, in the haste with which I have written this communication, that I have com- mitted the mistake of saying that I had placed 35 men on board the Wave ; that vessel had on board only 19 men."
			"FROM CAPTAAIN JARVIS TO COMMODOnE TunsEnR.
			"United States' ship Savannah off Vers Cruz,
			Mexico March IL
			"Sir,-I had the honour of forwarding a communication to you on the 3d inst. by the English mail steamer, in which I stated that the )EngUsh Government was trying to effect an armistice between the contending parties in Mexico. Since then I have been informed that Miramon has made proposals which have been rejected asinadmissable by this Government. I have not been able to ascertain if they have made any counter proposition. On the 3d inst. General MIramon having arrived at Medeline, I sent Com- mander Turner, with the permission of this Government, to communieate with him,-and I herewith enclose Comman- der Tarner's report to me. On the 4th inst. this Government withdrew the exequatur from Mr. B. B. L Twyman, American Consul, for good and substantial reasons, they say. The whole of the facts, I presume, will be reported to the State Department by the Legation here. At the request of the Secretary of Legation, I3 have given Lieutenant leire, of the Marine CorpS, permission to accept, for the time being, of an appointment from him of Vice-Consul, which, I trust, will meet your approbation.
			" On the 6th inst. two vessels, apparently of war, appeared at anchor off Antigna,-a smaU place about 14 miles to the northward of this, without any colours flying. After lying there some time, they got under way, and proceeded to the southward and eastward. They paid no attention to the flags on board of the men of war, nor to the castle, from which a gun was fired, to call their attention to the fact. They treated aU with contempt, and prooeeded to Anton Lizardo, where they came to anchor. Under these circum- stances I felt it my duty to ascertain who they were, and I therefore sent the United States' ship Saratoga, Commander Trner, upon that duty. As the wind was directly ahead, I availed myself of the offer of two small steamers to take her in tow. For further particulars of the unfortanate occur- rence that took place afterwards I must refer you to Com- mander Turner s report. I do not see how it was posable for Commander Turner to do otherwise than he did ; and I think that he and the other officers deserve great credit for their promptness in defending their flag.
			"I shall send the two steamers to New Orleans as soon as possible, and I have ordered Commander Jenkins, of the L'reble, who will accompany them with the prisoners, after delivering the steamers to the United States' Marshal, to take thie e crews on beoard his vessels, and proceed t
			P'ensacola for provisions. I have been under the necensty
			hf employing a part of the engimeers, firemen, l ., be- longing to the two steamers, to carry them to New Orleans, and I have directed Cemmander Jenkins to pay them for the time they may be employed at the same rate as is paid for their grade In the navy of the United States.
			" This piece is at the present time closely hesieged. On, the night of the 6th inst. they attempted to carry it by storm, but were beaten off, and, from present appearances, I think tho same result will occur, should they again attempt it. From all I can learn they have as many troops in the city as the besieglng party.
			"I am, Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

			"Saratoga, off Vera Cruz, Snnday, March 4. "Captain Joseph R. Jarvis, Commanding United
			States' Ship Savannah,
			"Sir,-I have the honour to inform you that, in obe- dience to your instructions, I proceeded yesterday to the head-quarters of General Miramon, at the town of Mede- Line, aboat four leagues distant. Immediately on my arrival I despatched a messenger to him to announce my presence in the town, and to say, ' That having in charge a communication from yourself, I should be glad to know at what hour he would be pleased to receive me.' I was nformed in reply that he would see me at once. Without loss of time I repaired to his lodgings, where I was received by him, accompanied by General Robles and Mr. Dias, his Minister of Justice. I Informed dm that I had been instructed to say to him that having been sent to this coast for the exclusive purpose of affording protection to the persons and property Df American citizens, as the senior officer present, you had felt yourself bound at the earliest moment of his appear. ance before Vera Cruz to ascertain from him distinctly what were his intentions in respect to tbe persons and property of American citizens in that city, in the event of his aking it.
			"He replied without hesitation that, as in the case of all foreigners, he should respect them and it, and should afford to both American citizens aud their property all the protec- tion which it was in his power to give.
			" I then said, 'Having received this assurance, Sir, I am further instructed by Captain Jarvis to say, that in your attack upon the city, and in the event of your gaining pos- session of It, he wiJl cause to be hoisted at the flag-staff of each house covering American citizens and property the flag of the United States, in order that, as far as it is possible,
			they and it may be preserved from danger and damage by bombardment, and to insure to the occnpants of those re- idences that respect on the part your troops, with which yOU have yourself expressed your determination to regard them.'
			"He replied that he concurred in the wisdom and neces- sity of such an arrangement, should bear it in mind, and hoped that It would be effectual in preserving them from harm and injury.
			" I remarked in conclusdon, that I was happy to take back such a reply, which could not faU to be satisfactory to my commanding officer, and thus ended the oficial part of my intercourse. In his deportment towards me General Miiramon was grave and reserved, but respectful and courteous. On the other hand, General Robles received and treated ine vith the greatest cordiality and kindness during my entire interview. On leavtng, I said to him that I desired to remain in the town until the cool of the evening for my return, and that I had several communications from persons in Vera Crass to members of their famlles, who had taken refuge in MedeUne, which I should like to deliver. He replied, ' Go where you please, stay as long as you like, and deliver wvhat you have to whom- soever you likte,' with which I took leave of him.

			But little business of interest was done in the Senate on the 29th. A joint resolution, offered by Mr. Green, that Congress adjourn from the 20th of April to May 21, was taken up, and after a short debate was rejected by a vote of 12 to 29. The Bill,
			supplementary to the Act to protect citizens who may discover deposits of guano, was amended, and passed. So was the Bill to prevent desertions and facilitate enlistments in the United States' army. Mr. Grow, having lost all hope of the House taking any action on the Pacific Railroad Bil, gave notice that be should call up that measure on the following Thursday. In the House a message was re- ceived from the President, protesting against the proposed investigation of his official acts. After an exciting debate it was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, with power to report at any time. Subjoined is a copy of the President's message
			" To the House of Representatives,-
			"After a delay which has afforded me ample time for re- flection, and after much and careful deliberation, I find myself constrained by an Imperious sense of duty, as a co-ordinate branch of the Federal Government, to protest against the first two clauses of the first resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on the 5th inst., and pub- lished in the Congressional Giobe on the succeeding day. These clauses are in the folowing words:-
			"'Resolved,-That a committee of five meabers be ap- pointed bythe Speaker for the purposr , firt, of invest- gating whether the President of the United States or any officer of the Government has by money, patronage, or other improper mens, sought to inflyence the passage of any las appertaining to the righis of any State or territorvl; and second, alse to inquire into and investigate whetier any
			fflicer or offices of the Government have, by combination or other ise, prevented or defeated, or attempted to prevent or defeat, the execution of any law or laws now upon the statute-book, and whether the President has faled or refused to compel the execution of any law thereof.'
			"bI confine myself exdcusively to theso two branches o-f the resolution, because the portions of it which follow relat to alleged abasesin the Post-offioe, Navy-yards, public buildings, and other public works of the United States. In such cases inquiries are highly proper In themselves, and belong equatly to the Senate and House, as incident to their legislatve duties, and being necessaryto enable them to dis- cover and provide appropriate legislative remedies for any a.buse which may be ascertained. Although the terms of the latter portion of the resolution ure extremely va,ue and
			generl, yet ay sole purpose in advertig to them ac present is to make the broad line of distinction betwveen the accu- satory and the remedial clauses of this; resolution. The H-ouse of Representatives po!sseeres no powver under the Constitution over the first oracquisatory portion of time reso lution, except as an impeaching body, while over the last, in common with the Sanate, their authority as a legislative body is fully and cheerfuUly admitted,
			" It is solely in reference to the first or Impeaching power that I presume to make a few observations. Except in this single case, the Constitution has invested the House of Representatives with no powYer, no jurisdiction, no,
			supremaey whatever over the President. In al other respects he is quite as independent of them as they are of him.. As aco-ordlng:te branchroftheGoverozment he istheir equal Indeed heis t onlydirectrepresenttive onearth or the people of all and can!' Of the sovereign, States. To them, and them alone, is he reaponsIble, while acting within the sphere of his constltionMl idutty, and not inany manner to the House of Representatives.
			pThe people have thought proper to invest him with the mosteonourable, resnsibe asndd cgnied officep n the world, and the individ however unworthy, now holding this exalted position wil take care, so far as in him lis that their rights and prerogatives shat never be violatedenc his person, but shall pass to his succeszors unimpaired by the adotion ofadangerousprecedent. Hewiill defend them to the -las extremity against any unconstitutional attempt come from what quarter It may,to abridge tue constitutoina rights of the Executive, and render him{ sbs erviet to any human power except themselves.
			th" The people have not confined the P zredent to exercise
			th Exective duties. They have also conferred upon him a large meame of legshlative discretion. No i can become a law without his approval, sa rrE0SC the ople of the Uniwt States, unless it sha pass aft havc by a majority of two-third of both Honses. In his legislative capacity he might, in commor with the Senate and the House, institute inquiry to ascrtain any facts which ought to influence his judgment in approving or vetoing any BIll. This partici- pating in the performance of legislative duties between co- ordinate branches of the Government ought to nrspire the conduct of all of them In their reation toward each other with mutoal forbearance and rspect; at least, each has a right to demand justice of the other. The cause of complaint Is that the constitutitonal rights and immunities of the Exe- cutive have been violated In the person of the President. The trial of an impeachment of the Presldent before the Senate, on charge-s preferred and prosecuted against him by the House of Representatives, would be en imposci s ectac e forthe world. In the result,net only hisfremova rem the Presidential office would be involved, but, what is of infi- nitey greater importance to himself, his character both in the eyes of the present and of future generations might poe. dibly be tarnished. The disgrace cast upon him would In some degree be reflected upon the character of the American people who elected him. Hence the precautions adopt-ed
			y the Constitution to secare a fair tril On stuh a tri
			It declares that the Chief Justice shall preside. This was doubtless because the framers of the Constitution believed it to he possible that the Vice-President might be biassed by the fact that, in case of the removal of the President from office, the same shal devolve on the Vice-President. The preliminary proceedings in the House in case of charges which may involve impeachment have beet well and wiselY settled by long. practice upon principles of qual itustice both to the accused and to the people.
			" The precedent established in the ease of Judge Peck, Missouri, in 1831, after a careful review of all the former pretcedents, will, I venture to predlict, stand the test of time.
			n at case Luke Edward Lawless, the acuc ser, presented a petition to the House in which he set forth minutely and specificaly his causes of complaint. He prayed that the conduct and proceadings in this behalf of the said Judge
			reck may be inquired into by your heon body, and such deciion made thereon as to your wisdom and justice shal seemgproper.
			"Tis petition was referred to thoJutdiciary Committee. Such has ever been deemed the appropriate committee to makte a simlar investigation. It is a standing committee, supposed to be appointed without reference to any special clase, and at al times is presumed to bel compose of the most eminent lawyers in the House from different portions of the country, whiose acquaintance with judicial proceedlings and whese habits of Investigation qualfy them peculiarly for the task. No tribunal, from their position and character, could in the nature of things be more impartial. In the case of Judge Peek the witnesses were selected by the com- mittee itself, with a view to ascertain the troth of the charge. They were cross-examined by him, and everything was conducted in such a manner as to afford him no reason- able cause of complaint.
			"oIn view of this precedent, and, what is of far greater importance, In view of the constitution and prinacples of eteral jeastico, In what manner has the President of the United States been treated by the House of Representa- tives? Mr. John Covode, a representativo from Pennsyl- vania, Is the accuser of the President. Instead of folowing the wise precedents of former times, and especially that in the case of Judge Peek, and referring the accusation to the Committee on Judicisry, the House have made my accuser one of my judges.
			"To make the accuser the judge is a violation of the principles of universa justice, and Is condemned bY the practice of all civilized nations. Every freeman mus revolt at such a spectacle. I amn to appear before Mr. Covode, either personally or by a substi- tute, to cross-examine the witnesses which ho may produces before himself to sustain his own accusations against me, and perhaps even this poor boon may be denied to the President. And what is the nature of the investiga- tion which hie resolution proposes to institute? Itis as vague and general as the English language affordls words in which to make It. The committee Is to inquire, not into any spe- cific charge or charges, hut whether the President has, by ' money, patronage, or other improper means, sought to in- fluence,' not the action of any indlividual member or mem- bers of Congress, but ' the action of the entire body of Congress itself,' or any committee thereof. The Presi- dent might have had some glimmering of the nature of the offences to be investigated had his accuser pointed to the act or acts of Congress which he sought to pass or to defeat by the employmnent of 'money, patronage, or other improper means.' But the accusation is bounded by no such limits ; it extends to the whole circle of legisation, to interference ' for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State or territory.' And what law does not appertain to the rights of some State or territory ? And what law or laws has the President failed to execoLte ? These might coally have been pointed out had any such existed.
			*liad lr. Lawless asked an inquiry to be made by the House whether Judge Peck, in general terms, had not vio- lated his judicial duties, without specification of any partl- cular act, I do not belteve there would have been a single vote in that body in favour of the inquiry. Since the timo of the Star Chamber and of general warrants thero bas been no such proceeding in England The House of Representatives, the high impeaching power of the country, without consenting to hear a word of explanation, have endorsed this acensation against the President, and made it their own act. They even refuse to permit a member to inqire of the President's aecuser what were the spe-
			hlal charges against him. Thns, in this preliminary accusation of ' high crimes and misdemeanours' against a co-ordinate branch of the Government under the impeaching power, the House refused to hear a single suggestion even in regard to the cor- rect mode of proceeding; but, without a moment's delay, passed accusatory resolutions under the pressure of the pre- vious question. In the institntion of a prosecution for any offence against the most humble citizen-and I claim for myself no greater rights than he enisys-the Constitution of the UJnited States and of the several States require that he shal be informed, in the very beginning, of the nature and
			cause of the accsaton against him, in order to enable him to prepare for his defence. There are other principles which Imight enumerate, not less sacred, presenting an impenetrable shield to protect every citizen falsely charged with a criminal offence. These have been violated in the prosecution instited by the House of Representatives against theGovernment. ShaU the President alone be deprived of the protection of these great principles which prevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrates the gloom of despotism 2 Shall the Executive alone be deprived of the rights which aU his felow-citizens enjoy ? The whole proceeding against him justifies the fears of those wise and great men who, before the Constitu- tion was adopted by the States, apprehended that the ten- dency of the Government was to the aggrandizement of the Legislative at the expense of theExecutive andJudicial De- partments.
			"I again declare emphaticaUy that I make this protest for no reason personal to myself, and I do it with perfect respect for the House of Representatives, in which I had the honour of serving for five successive terms. I have lived long in this goodly land, and have enjoyed all the offices and honours which my country could bestow. Amid all the political storms through which I have passed, the present Is the first attempt which has ever been made, to my knowledge, to assail my personal or political integ- rity ; and this has been done as the time is approaching w,hen I shaU voluntarily retire from tho service of my country. I feel roudly conscious that there Is no public act of my life which wil not bear the strictest scrutiny. I defy al investigation. Nothing but the basest per ury can sully my good name. I do not fear even thts, because I cherish an humble confidence that the gracious Being who has hitherto defended and protected me against the shafts of falsehood and malice wiU not desert me now when I have become ' old and gray-beaded.' I can declaro before God and my country that no human being, with an excep- tion scarcely worthy of notlce, has at any period of my life dared to approach me with a corrupt or dishonourable pro- nosition; and, untI recent developments, it had never mtered into my imagination that any person, even in the storm of exasperated political excitement, would charge me, in the most remote degree, with having made such a propo- sition to any human being. I may now, however, exclaim, in the language of complaint employed by my first and greatest predecessor, that I have been abused ' in such ex- aggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a Nero, to a notorious defaulter, or even to a common pickpocket.'
			" I do, therefore, for the reasons stated, and in the name of the people of the several States, solemnly protest against these proceedings of the House of Representatives; because they are in violation of the rights of a co-ordinate Executive branch of the Government, and subversive of its constitu- tional independence- because they are calculated to foster a band of interested parasites and informers, ever ready for their own advantage to swear before ex parte committees to pretended private conversations between the President and themselves, incapable, from their nature, of being disproved, thus furnishing ma- terial for harassing him, degrading him in the eyes of the country, and eventually, should he be a weak or timid man, rendering him subservient to improper influences in order to avoid such persecutions and annoyances; because they tend to destroy that harmonious action for the com- mon good which ought to be maintained, and which I sin- cerely desire to cherish between the co-ordinate branches of the Government; and finally, because, if unresisted they would establish a precedent dnngerons and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be astacbed. "JAMES BUCHANAN.
			" Washington, March 28."
			A large fire broke out in Independence, Mobile, on the night of the 29th ult., which consumed nearly the whole south side of the city. The Independence Hotel, two drug stores, 10 or 12 business houses, and a number of dwellings were destroyed. The probable loss is about $150,000.
			The examination of the Chinanan charged with the murders on board the sloop Spray was continued at Jersey City. Severed witnesses testified as to the aloop leaving New York for Gusildford on the 15th nt., and parting w;ith otherivessels off Norwalk, Connecticut, irt w;hih harbour it ins upposed she
			anchored {or the night. Others, who saw tho sloop returning through Hurl Gate the following Satur- day, stated that only the prisoner Jackalow was seen on board. The' particulars of the findine of the sloop off Barnegat aed the stories told by the prisoner were repeatedL In "he afternoon several other articles were taken from the cabin, on which were stains of blood. The case was to be c-ncluded on the 31st.
			The Ariel, which had arrived at New York from Aspinwall, brings later news from the seat of war in -ew Granada. The State forces had defeated the armies of Carri.lo, the leader of the revolution in Cauca, in several engagements. Tn a combat which took place on the 22d of February, lios- qulera,'s troops, under General Obando, gained a victory over the Federal chieftain's men, killing their commander, General Plies, and 300 of them. Mosquera is now " master of the situation."
			Intelligence from California to the 9th uilt. was received bythe Overland Mlail. Much excitement existed regarding a Bil under consideration in the Legislature, granting to a company the right to construct a sea-wall along the water front of San Francisco. There were indications that the Bill ap- propriating $60,000 to the first companywhich should construct a telegraphic line from San Francisco to the Mississippi would pass.
			A despatch of the 29th, from New Orleans, says:-
			" Governor Honstou, not receiving the Government m2i- tary aid as expected, has ordered Colonel Johnson to imume- diately raise a large force of rangers and drive the Indians from the northern frontier. He takes no step against Mexico pending the ratification of a treaty."
			A deapatch from WVashington of the 30th says
			"Petitionsfrom all parts of New York are pouring in, praying that the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada mav be amended or rescinded. Hostility to it is daily growing more bitter, so ruinous is it to the interests of WesternNow York. Mr. Hatch's reporb will not only be strongly con- demnatory of the treaty, bet will urge that it be abrogated at the earliest possible day. President Buchanan wilt lay the report immediately before Congress, in answer to the resolution introduced by the Hon. Alfred Ely, calling upon him to communicate to the House, if, in his opinion, not Incompatible with 'he public inte- rests, al the information in his possession relative to the practical working of the treaty, whether the Provincial Government of Canada has not, through its Legislature, violated the spirit of the said treaty; what has been the prac- tical effect of the third clause of the treaty upon the interests of the respective countries; what measures, if any, had been taken to procure correct information tonching the practicel operation and effect of the third clause of 'he treaty upon the interests of American citizens, and whether, in his opinion, the said third article could not, with advan- tage to American Interests, be either amended or rescinded. This course of MIr. Ely brings up the whole question, and when opportunity offers he wllc discuss it at length before the House. It Is said Canada has increased the tariff on goods not named in the free list tUl It amounts to prohibi- tion. The evil is great, and needs prompt correction
			" The documents sent in to the Senate to-day by the President embrace the instructions of the Navy Department to Captain Jarvis. Under date of July 27, 1S5S, he is in- formed that the ship of w;ar Savannah has beeen repared for service in the home squadron, and he is directed to proceed with her to San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua.

			" The foUowing letter from the Secretary to CaDtain Jar- vis had not reached him at the time of the capture of the Milramon steamers :-
			t "'Navy Department, March 13.
			" Slr,-With a view to afford the protection due to our citizens at Vera Cruz, the President has directed the Hon. R. M'Lane, should a hostile force approach that place, and he should consider the American citizens there in danger from its operations, to request the commanding officer of the 'United States' vessels of war on that coast to land such forces as may be needed and can be spared from indispen- sable duties, and to employ them for the protection of our citizens whose persons or property he may believe to be in danger. Should Mr. M'Lane, therefore, make of you, as senior commauding officer, the request which his mstres- tions autlorize him to do, you ii promptly comply with it. Statements having been made which lead to the belief that arrangements are making by what is known as tho Mliramon Government of Mexico to establish a blockade at Vera Cruz and other ports on the Gulf of Mexico, the President has dlecided that no such blockade wfi be recog- nised by the United States. You are therefore directed to einploy the naval force under your command to afford Ame- rican vessels free ingress and ogress at all Mexican ports, and fully to protect them.'

			AGITATION AGAINST THE ALIT-TAX.-A speci
			meeting of the Ipswich Farmers' Club wns convened on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of organizing, if possible, a campaign against the malt-tax. lo fewer than seveni resolutions were proposed and adopted, the speakers being all tenant farmers, or persons engaged in agricultursi pur- suits. A great variety of arguments were urged against the continuance of the tax, it being contended that it operated injurionsly on the morals and comforts of the labor ing classes, that it serlously curtailedthe consumption of barley and impeded the operations of the agriculturist by preventing the use of malt for stack-feeding purposes, that it was unfair to reduce dutles on foreign wines and spirits, and still to subject the national beverage-beer-to heavy taxation, and that it would he unjust, as recently proposed, to compel the britisht naltster to pay his duty within a linited period wbile foreign malt was to be allowed to remain In bonl. The meeting pronounced 'he tax injurious to British farmers, as producers of barley and meat, and declared it unjust and in- defensible under the present free-trade system. It Vws also resolved that those parts of the budget of hlr. Gladstone re- lating to the admission of French wlnes and foreign malt, unaccompanied by any reduction in the duty levied on mialt produce at home, weere most uniust to the producer o' British barley and the consumer of BriMtsh beer. Several of the speakers counselled the commencement of an organ- ized agitation on the subject, and a commitiee vas ap- pointed to consider the practicablity of establishing am Anti-Malt-tax Assoclation. A suggestion was made that the proposed society sbould not be merely a local effort, bat that It should have its head-qunrters in the metro- polis, and endeavour to enlist the sympathies of al" classes of the public it ws- stated that Sir Fitzroy Kelly, MP., proposes to submit to or three resolutions on the qnestion to the House of Commons, and yesterday a deputation of members of the dub nitsed upon the hon. and earned gentleman to expres the views ofeiss meeting, and generally tD afford him information ana assistance. The meeting rerolved to connnunicate itS viewa to every member of the H e of Commons, and a ansecrin- tion was commenced to defray the cxpenWes Incident to tbe movement. The progress made in the formation of the
			proposed association wiU be reported in a few days; at,rL- from the tones ssumed on the subiect by the axrcultur,% press and ot'ner circmmstances, it sem-s probable ths. a strenuous cffort will be made to keep the question-r,hieh Is one of especial interest to the eastem counties, &amp;3, they prodrxe the best malting btley-hbelorgthe Duble,

			(E1OI 0UR OWN CORRESMpoynE-.)
			EAMS, TUEDAY, APRI 10, 6 P.m.
			As I mentioned yesterday, the Patrie publishes, at the head of its first page, a paragraph purport. ng; to contradict its own repeated statement, that it wan England that got, up the Carlist " demon- stration" In Spaln and the popular rising in SicllY. The paragraph, -which Is desicrbed as a "cote MuniE from the Home Department," is to this effect .-
			" On the occasion of the attempts at insenection which have taken place in Spain and Sicily, two journals, the PaYs ndPafrie, contain against unelghbouring Power (puiszance veisine) Imputations which are to be regretted These jour- nas ought all the less to have accepted them that, as they themselves admit, they are devoid of all authenticity."
			It has been hinteds that this communique was drawn up by the Emperor's own hand. I do not believe it was. His Majesty would not have made use of the cold, aupercilious expression, " puissance vo,W7ne" when speaking of a friendly allied nation, the first to recognize him as Emperor of the French and the first to do him honour as a neighbour. Neither would the Emperor have merely observed of the wretched libel in question that it was " devoid of all authenticity ;" he would have said 5t devoid of aU foundation." " Devoid of all au- thenticity" means that the statement given in the congenial columnna of the Pairie and Paays was merely informal, but it does not say it was untrue; it would imply that the charge was real, though the proofs to establish it are incomplete. In fact, the phrase resembles the Scotch verdict "Not proven."
			The Pavs and Patrie are so accustomed to be cou- tradicted and snubbed by authority that little for- bearance would, of course, be observed towards them; but depend upon it we owe the " puissance voisine, and the " denuges de toute authenticiM" to some subordinate offEcial, who thinks he best pleases his superiors by an air of supercliousness. - Now, from whatever quarter the article was furnished- that which charged the English Government, and a Government of which Lord Palmerston is the head, with getting up a Carlist insurrection in Spain-it is certain that it must have had its imrprima- tur from the Press Department of the Home-office. At the head of that department is a cumulating gentleman, once aformidable protester againstImpe- rial regi?nes, hut now Couancillor of State, Director of the Press, Director of the Pat ne, and, it is said, the Ceniseitutionnel, chronicler of a MIinisterial review, Imperial areA i-&amp;roclsw-ier, &amp;c. Ln his department it would appear that the articles of the Limayrac class are wfritten, and, when not actuallv concocted
			there, are in al cases submitted to the visa of the Director. WVith the multifarious functions which suo complicated a functionary has to go through, it is not surprising that mistakes should occur; but it -naust be an annoyance to the Emuperor and his Miinister that the egregious blunder of the Pat ne and CnLstiftutio nel-the Pays is too insignificant for notice-should at once beq fathered on high authoritv by the public, who are not aware of the private machinery which produces them. It Is the opinion of men of high official position and of authority in these matters that the " Direction de la Presse," &amp;c., in its present form is a nuisance and an excrescence on the Home-office which it would be as well to cut off altogether.
			General Lamoricire, writing to a friend in Paris from Rome, speaks very hopefully of the prospect of affairs. He says, "IWith the assistance of God, and our own diligence, I hope soon to have Roman Zouaves."
			The French troops continue to evacuate Lom- bardy. The 4th Division, commanded by General de Failly, is expected In France on Thursday next. The 3d, commanded by General Bazaine, is to be quartered in Paris. General Ulrich's Division wiUl come next. The Ist and 5th Divisions wil be the last to quit Italy. They will occupy Savoy and Nice. It is understood that Marshal Vaillant quittedMilan on Sunday last. All the letters received from the army of Italy state that the troops are delighted at returning to France. They are heartily sick of Italy and of the Italians.
			According to a now arrangement concluded be- tween the French Government and the Germanic Confederation the journey from Paris to Vienna will henceforth be accomplished by railway in 36 hours, while it at present requires 72 hours. The distance from Paris to Stuttgard will be performed in 16 hours, from Stuttgard to Munich in eight hours, and from Munich to Vienna in 12 hours. It is ex- pected that in two years from the present period the journey irom Paris to St. Petersburg will be per- formed in three days. It requires seven days at present.
			I have received the following letter
			'PESTH, AP= 5.
			*There has been another grand anti-Austrian demonstra- tlon in this city,but fortunately it has not occasioned blood- shed. Yesterday hf. For5nyak, one of the two students who died of wounds Inflicted by the Austrian soldiery on the 15th of last month, vas interred in the Herepes Cemetery, and an immense crowd of all classes, from the Festltics, the T?odmaniczkys, and the great nobles, down to the poorest tradesmen, attended the funeral of the poor young man. Some people calculate that there were at least 25,000 or 40,000 persons in the procession. What is certain Is, that the number vas Immense; and the windows of all the houses along which the c0r147e passed, especially those in the Uri-uteza, Nador-uteza, and Furdo-ntizc, were crowded vith spectators, chiefly ladies. In addition to the people, too, there was a long file of carriages. If the cere- mony passed off without disturbance of any kind, no credit is due to the Austnianfunctionaries, for theydidtheir utmost to excite one. More than one superintendent of police tauntingly addressed to the students who headed the pro- cession such observations as these:-' Don't you think that another row would be desirable? Just attempt one!' I 'What ! yoe turn out In such vast numbers, and dare do nothing? You really are not brave!' In spite, however, of the violent bravado of these people-bravado which the students treated with contempt-tbe higher authorities were in trepidation until the whole affair was over. They kept the troops under arms in the barracks, and, in addition they made an atte.mpt to render the demonstration Insigai ficant, by giving out that the funeral would not take place until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, whereas it really did so at 4; but the people, knowing how tr!cky the :authoritles are, were on foot betlmes.
			" There, is no probabillty that anything like the 200,000,0006d. which the Vienaese Government wants to borrow wlll be subscribed. In Hungary nobody has offered anything, except a few great companies and certain person- ages who dared not refuse. The Government intended to compel municipalities and localities to take portions of the loan, as it did with the famous ' voluntar one somo years back, and it sent orders to its functionaries to make prepa- ratlons for the pTurpose. Bat these gentlemen reported nlmost unanimously tbat from the dreadful distress of the populations no money could possibly be wrung from them . and, moreover, that from the Irritation they feel against the Government any attempt of the kind would most likely oc- casion sanguinary outbreaks. I have reason to believe that similar communications have been mado by the func- tionaries of other provinces as well as those of Hungary.
			" A grand vocal and instrumental concert, given by ladies of rank for the relief of the starving population of Croatla, came off n few days back In thle NKational Theatre of Pesth. It attracted an Immense auditory, and excited unbounded enthusiasm. The young Countesses Zichy, Batthyany, and Orezywero greatly applauded; but It was the Countess Nako Gyertyanffy. who, by playing national airs on the piano, ex- cited most enthusiasm."
			The oldest inhabitants in Paris remark that Easter Monday was seldom so joyously celebrated by the Parisian population, but particularly by the opera- tives in the Faubourg St. Antoine, as it was yester- day. There was not a hackney coach on a stand nor a vacant seat in an omnibus to be found. The gingerbread fair, at the spot where the Barriere du Trdne formerly stood, wad so crowded that the Ei:mperor, who drove through it w;ithout an escort, on his wfay to Vincenlnes, found it difficult to pass. iBeing recognillzed by the people, ho wsas loudly .,heered.
			The weather has not improved. Last night was cold, the thermometer having fallen two degrees during the day. Rain fell free S to 12 this mnorn- ing ; we then enjoyed a gleam of sunshine until 2 when half-melted snow or sleet fell for an hour. The peach and apricot trees In the neighbourhood of Paris are in blossom, and it is feared they will suffer from the extraordinary changes of the weather, particularly as this afternoon the sky has the ap pearance of approaching frost.

			SARDNIA.
			(O3 OIM OWNi CORRESPONDEN.)
			TURIN, ApRIL S.
			The Garibaldi incident of last Friday in the House of Deputies, and the harsh and flippant tone adopted by Count Cavour towards him, have left in m,en's minds an impression bordering on dismay. "NWice is sacrificed," people murmur; " and not one word is to be said about it." Cavour must feel tolerably strong in his own and the King's popu- larity to entertain any hope as to his chances of weathering the coming storm. Savoy and Nice had been the propitiatory victims originally offered to France for the redemption of Lombardy and Venice. That France should have all her reward when hardly half her share of the bargain is fulfilled may be hard enougeh to bear. But the loss of Savoy, and even that of Nice, wTould not be half as dis- tressing to the Italians as the terrible breach in their constitutional liberties and the inroad on their national independence. If Cavour en-aged, at Plombieres or elsawhere, at any time to part
			eith those provinces to Frauce, he should, at least, have distinctly and inviolably stipulated, that the rights of the people concerned, and of the whole nation as represented in Parliament, should beo reserved. He felt himself that he had, as a Plenipotentiary, taken more authority upon him- self than a constitutional State ever allow,s to a dliplomatist. Accustomed to the exercise of very absolute power within the Cabinet, in which he fre- quently takes two, and even three portfolios upon his own shoulders,-to sway at his own discretion the mind of the brave and generous but some- what easy and indolent lg,-to rouse and to lull at his pleasire, to browbeat sometimes and even bully his Parliament, Cavour never stopped to consider the nature of a promise which bound him to the sale or barter of rational beings, and gave himself as little conceru about it as if they were mere dumb cattle.
			It is a long way, perhaps he reflected, from Turin to Venice, or even Vienna; the incidents of the war he began miight be many and various, and, like that courtly scholar who had undertaken to finish the education of his Sovereign's pet donkey, he very naturally reasoned that before the time agreed upon had elapsed either he or the King, or at aUl events the donkey, would surely die. But the war broke offtoo abruptly; the bargain was looked upon as norn aveaa, and the political schemer breathed freely. The fox, however, should never presume to have outvitted the lion. The Emperor INapo- leon, who saw from the beginning his best share of tho prey escapinghim in Central Italy, who hurried on the Peace of Villafranca goaded by the downfall of his hopes in that quarter-vho beheld, by the complication of events, by the instinct of the people, and by his very manceuvres, that very share of the prey falling to the humble friend who had cheated him out of it, now put forth his heavy paw, broke the maeshes of the net in which he had been caught, and offered to Count Cavour the choice between renunciation of Central Italy or cession of Savoy and Nice.
			Cavour took the latter alternative, and 'thought that the indeDendence and freedom of 12,000,000 Italians would reconcile his people to the loss of 600,000 decidedly Gallic discontented Savoyards, and of 130,000 somewhat mongrel, though certainly loyal and well-disposed Kizzards.
			So it might have turned out if the afifair had been properly managed, if at least the appearance of principle had been saved. There is hardlv an Italian able to explain to me how it was that Count
			,avour wasbetrayed into that shameless declaration, "that the King's Government had never dreamt of giving up Savoy or Nice ," how it was that he afterwards promised that " nothing should or could be done without the vote of the people and the con- sent of Parliament." There is no compromise be- tween principle and expediency, and it was even better either to avow that Sardinia was acting under irresistible coercion, or to plead the great gain to the Italian cause, in consideration of which it was worth while to strain a point or two and break the statutes of the realm than to involve one's-self in a maze of deceits which, after all, imposed upon no man, and added to the loss of two provinces and the violation of the national liberties, the blot on the King's fair name, and the ruin of his Minister's well-earned reputation.
			Isut now consummatum est, and wise men do not re- pine at the irrevocable past. The cruel mockery of an appeal to the popular suffrage will be hurried on in Savoy and Nice. Parliament, if it have a chance to speak at all, will only have to deliver a funeral oration. Garibaldi himself will be too wise not to " let the dead bury their dead;" and Europe will hardly go over a transaction by which none of the parties concerned declare themselves aggrieved.
			Cavour's conduct in all this matter is not praised by any man; but there are those who attempt to oeplain it-those who fancy they can get an Insight initsvast and distant bearings. "France," they say, "is the only ally of Piedmont; in France itself Italy can reckon only upon one man-that man, the ESmperor Napoleon. It wzas he alone who vwished for the wvar; he wvho dragged the reluctant nation after him against Austria; he who wrenched L:ombardy from the latter Power by might of arms, and the Central Provinces by a series of diplomatic feints and devices, by a whole pack of unutterable lies. Napoleon has set his mind on the deliverance of Italy-of the vhole of Italy. His vast mind comprehends at one sweep the vastness and variety of the obstacles he has to contend with. He knows the means by which the great end is to be attained. He must needs bo allowed to rork in his own -way. Already, in spite of the curses of friends and foes, he has triumphantly acquitted himself of a great part of his own task. For the attainment of the final object he must use Franco as a willing instrument. He cared never a rush himself for Savoy and Nice: it was a sop wherewith he gratified the vain ambition, the childish greediness of the French nation. For the sake of those poor ' dupes' (now he has given them a taste of conquest) Napoleon could easily lead the French armies to the Rhine, to the Danube,
			across the Channel, wherever the enemies of the Ita-- lian cause may have their head-auarters. Savoy and Nice he must have-nay, he must have them in his own way, that way which best may flatter the French nation by giving it a high notion of his dexterity, of his imperiousness, of his omnipotence,-that way which best may wound the pride of Europe, and be resented as a most unprovoked, unjustifiable out- rage. Hence must Cavour not only yield to him, but connive at, make shift, and quibble with him-above all things, boldly and shockingly lie with him. It is part and parcel of the scheme, and ' la parole nous est donnee paour d&amp;quiser nioS pensies.' The Pied- montese constitution is in danger ; but who would not let even that perish that Italy may live ?"
			This, be it understcod, is not my way of reason. ing; it is the apology I hear urged forward daily by Count Cavour's partisans when this hateful subject of Nice and Savoy is mooted. That the new Italian kingdom is in the hands of France no man would undertake to deny. Cavour's policy finds no sup- port beyond the Alps, except in England-a Power that shrinks from active interference in conti nental matters. Were there anything like political wisdom presiding over the Council of the European Powers, it might, perhaps, not be impossible to in- duce. if not Cavour, at least some other Sardinian statesman, to borrow a leaf out of the book of old Savoy history, and bring this kingdom to join the array of a European coalition against France. There are not a few patriotS here who are satisfied neither with Napoleon nor with his fellow-plotter at Plom- bicres. French policy is, to a great extent, forced upon the Italians as an incubus not to be shaken off.
			go over from France to Austria would sound
			simply unnatural and monstrous; to give back; the earnings of the last 10 months, or even to renounce the hope to which past successes have given rise, would be sheer madness. Rather Etand by and fall with Prance ! But let only a glimpse of light be made on the other quar- ter; let it only be supposed, for one moment, that Austria is stil to be persuaded to part with Venice, or at least with the line of the Mlncio, in considera- tion of the help the Itallans might give Europe,
			while wreaking their own vengeance on the man. who betrayed them at Villafranca, and in cold blood wrenched the Westen Passes of the Alps, 50 miles of Mediterranean shore, and some of their most loyalfeUow-subjctsandbravestfightingmen,
			let there be such a loophole opened, and we shall hear then the real mind of the Italians as to the merits of their " magnanimous ally."
			These are not thoughts to be uttered in a tone above a man's breath. Piedmont and Italy are in the toils of France, and there is no practical good in the eupposition that Austria may ever be made to hear reason. It is quite certain, nevertheless, that the Italians see themselves in a false position, with a kingdom frontierless on both sides, at the mercy of two colossal Powers, vwith a constitution broken at the outset, with their faith shaken as to the value of men and men's words, heartily sick of the French,
			unwiling to turn to the Austrians, and yet unable, as of old, to seek in themselves that strong determi- nation which alone, under any difficulties, can work out the real emancipation of a nation.
			Yet even this is progress. Twelve millions of briving, thinking, aspirina Italians is in itself a new, a great, a consoling phenomenon. The national embryo is formed; the events that are rapidly maturgin the south may give it rapid and unex- pectedly important development. The blood shed in Rome and Sicily, the wholesale proscriptions from the Papal and Neapolitan States, the appalLing emigration from the Venetian and Trentine pro- vinces, a migratlon the want of wihich even all the pu-blic and private charity of the Lombards is hardly any longer able to meet,-aU tends to a crisis of which cold reason cannot foresee the probable issue. Neither France nor Austria, certainly, would willingly lend a hand to the enfranchisement of Italy; but there is a force of events stronger than either of those Powers, stronger than both of them:-

			THE PAPAL STATES.
			The following letter is dated Rome, 3d inst. :-
			" General Lanoricicre arrived in Rome on Sunday after. noon, and had a private audience of the Pope yesterday morning. The General had already inspected the Papal army and the garrisons in the Marches, and he expressed his approbation of their organization to his IIoliness and to Cardinal Antonelli. The General has consented to accept the command of the Papal troops, but he will not receive orders from tho War-office, where overybody is completely ignorant of the science of war. Three French officers of the 40th Eegiment of the Line have been imprisoned in the Castle of St. Angelo by order of General Goyon. This severe measure has been caused by the improper conduct of those persons towards one of their comrades, who, on the 19th of March, was ordered to execute orders given by the Commander-in-Chief. They insulted their brother officer, and afterwards refused to apologize, though recommended to do so by their Colonel. M. Caraffa, secretary of the Duike CesarSni, who was arrested in consequence of letters on polStical subjects being found in his house, has received a passport, with orders to quit the Roman States. Several persons who vere arrested in consequence of the riot on the 19th have been set at ilberty. Several members of the Roman nobility mosb devoted to the Holy See have just purchased corn to the value of 40,000 Roman crowns to distribute, a' a loss of three half-crowns the rubbio, among the more indigent of the operative olasses. The following aro the names of various Princes, Kings, and Emperors who have been excommunicated more or less solemnly by preceding Popes :-John XII excom- municated Otho I., Emperor of Germany; Gregory V., King Robert, for having contracted an SlUegitimate marriage. Nicholas II. excommunicated Gerard, Count of Galicia; Gregory VII., Henry IV.; Urban Ir., King Philip of France, because he had carried off the wife of the Count d'Anjou and would not restore her; Pascal I., the Emperor HenryV.; Innocent IL, King Roger, of Sicily; Celestin II., Aiphonzo, King of Castile; Alexander IIL, the Emperor Frederick Barbhrossa; Celestin II., Duke Leopold, of Austria; Innocent IIL, Philip Augustns of France.

			SVITZERLAND.
			The followlng is the circular note addressed by the Swiss Confederation to the eight Powers repre- sented at the Congress of Vienna and to Sardinia:
			" Berno, April 5.
			"Since the future position of Savoy towards the COo federation has become the subject of diplomatic discussion the CouncUl of the Swiss Confederation has adhered firmly to the axiom that, according to the international guaranteed rights upon the question, nothing can be decided withont the positive co-operation of Switzerland. This view and the grounds thereof have been fnUlly developed in the note which the Council of the Confederation had the honour of ad- dressing, under date of the 19th of March last, to the high guaranteeing Powers of the treaties of Vienna. In the notes which have hitherto been exchanged with France and Sardinia the Council of the Swiss Confederation bas insisted upon the absolute necessity of a Congress of the Powers with a view, with the acknowledged participation of Switzerland, to consider the pending question, and to arrive at a solution responding to international principles and European interests. The Council of the Confederation was the morn justified in expecting a f3vourable acceptance of Its proposition as In the second article of the treaty of union of the 24th of March of this present year between France and Sardinia, at Turin, an understanding with the Powers represented at the Congress of Vienna on the one hand, and with the Swiss Confederation on the other, is dis- tinctly provlded. This voluntary engagement is offered to Swltzerland as a sure gnaranteo that this important quess
			tion wil receive a solution corre3gonding with the In- terests of Switzerland.
			" The path which the Council of tbe Swiss Confederation bas to folow to attain thls object is pointed out to It at the conclusion of the 4th article of the aboveoquoted proto- col, which was decreed by the Powers of the Congress at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 15th of November, lSIS.
			"The passage runs verblatim thus:-
			" EDes (ces Confirences des Puissances) n7auront lieu qn'A 1a suite d'une invitation formello de Ia part de ceux de ces Etats que les dites afraires concerneralent, et sous la rcserve expresse de leur droit d'y participer directement ou par leurs pl6nipotentlaires.'
			" The CouncU of theSwiss Confederation thus finds itself in a position to address a decidedappeal to the great Powers, that It will please them to convoke a Conference in the sense of the above-cited article so as to bring to a solution the pending conflict which has already assumed a European. Importance, in the interests of international law, as also in the interests of social order in Europe. As regards the place and time for such Conference, it is wiling to leave them to the wise judgment of the great Powers; and, with- ount taking any initiative In this respect, it simply expresses the wish that the Congress may meet with the least possible delay, as a speedy solution of the questlon, owing to the increaslng alarm felt in Switzerland, has become urgent. Hereunto the express condition is attached, that Swvitzerland herself shaU be admitted to participate in the discussions.
			" FinaUy, the Council of the Confederation must firmly insist that, until the decisions of the Conference are settled, the status quo is to be maintained unaltered in the neu- tralized provinces of Savoy, and that no occupation, civil or mlUitary, shal talke place. To this point the Confede- rate Assembly attached the greatest importance in Its sitting of the 4th of April. Doubtless, the maintenance of the status quo is not only in the in'terests of Switzerland, but in those of Europe in general, and the Federal Council is therefore entitled to expect that its present request will receive the approval and strong support of the great Powers to its full extent.
			" While the Swiss Federal Council has the honour ear- nestly to press its request and wishes on the considera- tion of the great Powers, anticipating a speedy and favour- able response thereto, It takes advantage of tho opportunity to subscribe itself,!kc.2'
			The following note has been addressed by MI. de Schleinitz, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Prussia, to M. de Kamptz, Prussian Envoy at Borne:-
			" Berlin, March 30.
			" Sir,-I have had tho honour to receivo the circular note, dated March 19, which his Excellency the President of the Hlelvetic Confederation; through your intermedium, bas addressed to us, as also to the other Powers represented at the Congress of Vienna, claiming their Intervention in favour of the rights which Switzerland can make valid as re- gards the neutralization of certain districts of Savoy, rights
			which the Federal Government thlnks are jeopardized by the cession of Savoy to France.
			" I need not tell you, Sir, that the steps taken by the Federal Government and the situation which caused It at- tract in the highest degree the serious attention of the Cabinet of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent.
			" Starting from the principle that It concerns a question which equally interests all the Powers that signed the act of the Congress of Vienna, the Pruassan Cabinetwvll endeavour to bring about an understanding between the Powers and Switzerland as to the means best suited to obviate any- thing that might encroach upon the independence or ner- trality of the Helvetic Confederation.
			" I beg of you, Sir, to read this despatch to and to le3ve a copy, should he desire one, w,ith his Excelency the Presldent of the Helvetic Confederation.
			11SCHLEINIT."
			The following letter has been addressed by Air. Baris, fhe British represontative, to the Swiss Federal Council:-
			"Berne, Aprll 5.
			"I have the honour to announce to you that in reply to the despatch which I addressed to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, wherein I spoke of the critical situation of the question of the neutralized territory of Savoy, his Excel- lency exprcess himself in these terms :-' That the quer- tion which concerns the Incorporation of Savoy with France, and which touches so nearly upon the interests of Switzer- land, winl be taken into duo consideration by the great Powers of Europe.'
			Under date of the 6th of April, Count Cavour, the Sardinian Minister of Foreign Afairs, has ad- dressed the following communication to JI. Tourte, the Swiss Envoy at Turin:-
			" Turin, April Gth.
			"Slr,-I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of two notes you have addressed to me under the respective dates of tho Ist and 5th inst.
			" Responding to the wishbe you have expressed, I lose no time in informing you that, conformable to tho treaty of the 21th of March, France will not tal;e possession of the pro- vinces of Savoy until the populations shall have given their vote and the Parliament has ratified the treaty.
			" The Sardinian authorities will, consequently, continue to govern the country.

			SgHrLLIA'G ART UNIONS.
			TO THD EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Slr,-I venturo to hope you will grant a small space in your columns to a letter I have written to Lord Shaftesbury on a subject I think of considerable public importance, together ith a copy of his reply.
			Your obedient servant.
			EGERTON ELLESMERE.
			'I my (tear Lord Sshattesbury,--1 enclose an advertisement from a lanihester paper of a new Art Union, called the Art Union of Great Britain, o, which yoa and other noble lords are stated to be vice-presidents.
			"I have so much respect for yonr opinion that I should be inclined to distrust my own judgment when it seems In opposition to yours, bat 1 cannot but think that the sane- tion of your name has been obtained to this scheme with- out its aim and obiects being properly explained to you. I am not opposed to and have frequently subscribed to Art Unions in various places. They do not encourago, perhaps, a very high style of art; but, no doubt, it is better there ;hoold he a general diffusion, though it be of second-rate productions, rather than only a few first-rate specimens in the exclusive possesslon of the wealthy.
			"Ijtherto, how ever, Art Unions have been so condueted that the gambling element, though not entirely absent, has been rendered tolerably innocuous. Each share was, and in many is stll, a guinea, givi a a certain right to a print of some sort, and a chance of a picture; which a man who eould afford to pay a guinea for his chance was likely to be able not only to enjoy hut to retain.
			"But in this new sohemo the shares are to be only Is., expressly in order to attract the working classes, while the prizes are to range from 1501. downwards. Now I don't for an instant assert that there Is not many a working man who is not as able to appreciate a good picture as any noble- man of the land; but it is perfectly absurd to suppose that a man, earning-say 18s. a-week, who suddenly be- comes the possessor of a picture worth 1001., can retain it, much as he may admire it. It must inevitably be sold, probably for two-thirds of its alleged value, and wiU of course be bought, not by another working man, but by one of the usual picture-buying class (so displacing, I may add, in the market the works of some other artist). The whole thing, then, results in a roundabout but not the less pernicious or unmitigated system of lotteries, which the working classes are not yet familiar with, but which if suffered to spread will shortly do untold harm. And the evil iS spreading. Besides this A rt Union there is another shilling one at Manchester, another at Liverpool, others, I believe, at Glasgow and Birmingham. It was stated that the 1001. price at the Manchester one was won by a female ;ervant at a Scotch town. WaTho can tell how many of her class have been incited by her eood fortune to invest their money In thes speculations ? Bow long will it be bafore she turns her prize into money, if for no ether reason, from sheer Inabllity to find a place to put it in ?
			"I make not the slightest Imputation On the good faith or good intentiOns of the promoters of these speculatIons. t1 believe them to be un3aware o.. the evil they are eon- tributing to disseminate. It is impoasible, however, to deny that, besides their inherent gambling character, there is no security in their arrangements against positive fraud. Thero is no guarantee that the number of shares sold may not bo much understated, a3 the numbering is avowedly fallacious.
			It might, perbaps, be a good way of counteracting the evil I have indicated for the Legislature to pass an Act to prohibit Art Unions from offering prizes of more than one hundred times the value of their shares. Thus, in a shilling Art Union there should be no prize above the value of 51. But I offer this merely as a suggestion. I hope I have said enough to explain whyl venture to ask youwhether a scheme like the Art UTnion of Great Britain really meets with your approval or not. "Verv faithfullv vours.
			, - lorquay, &amp;prii, i dw."
			'EGERTON ELLJESERE.
			" My dear llesmere,-I have wrilten to the secretary (of the Art Union in question) to withdraw my name. No one told me that it was a lottery. I believed it to be a sort of factory bazaar, such as we had at Bolton for the operatives. . . . . . " Yours trulv.

			THE LATE Mr. JrisGcm G. SmIOms.-It is with much regret that we record this day the decease of one of the most accomplished gentlemen and useful pnbio servants of the age, in the person of Mr. Jelinger Charles Symons, one of Her MAjesty's Inspectors of Schools, who died a few days since, of a rapid decline, at his residence at Great Malvern, Woreestershire, in the 51st year of his age. rerhaps, with the single exception of Canon 3Moseley, of Brlstol, there was no one whose name was more widely known than Mr. Symons in connexion with the great educational and reformatory movement which has left its impress so stamped upon tho middle of the 19th century. The son of a country clergy- man, who held at one timo the living of aage, ,fr. Symons was born in 1809, and received his educa- tion at Corpus Cnristi Colleme, Cambridge, where he rraduated B.A, in 1831. Rie was called to the bar tt the Middle Temple in 1843, but soon began to combine with the more special duties of his profession a devotion to literary onestions of a socal1 character, and more especially to the statistics of crime, education, and other kindred topics. His writings soon attracted the attention of Her Majesty's Government, by whom he was appointed one of the inspectors of schools. The various pamphlets, lectures, speeches, &amp;c., and more elaborate treatises on educational and social subjects which he publshed between that date and the present year, f,ll upwards of six pages in the new catalogue of the British Museum. Mr. Symons Is also known and remembered for a controversy which he carried on against Dr. Whewell respecting the revolution of the moon on its axis, and for an interesting essay on the author. ship of Junius; and he wa3 the contributor of several light and amusing papers to tho pages of Once a Wece. Sir. Symons on one occasion oftered himself as a cand idate for senatorial honounr, having come forward in the Liberal interest for Strond, but vre are not ure vwhether he actually weit to the poll. He married in 1845 Angelina, daughter of Mr. Edward Kendall, late of Davy-park, and formerly Hligh Sheriff of Breclcnoclshire, by whom he has left a y-oung family. As we learn irom the Cousp Famiflks, Mr. ,ymens represented a younger branch of the house of Symens, of the IIatt, near Stratton, Cornwall, who came. over wvith William the Couqueror,though they subsequently returned to France. and a descendent of wzhom wias noml- nated among the first members of the illustrious Order of the Garter.

			TEEB BRITISh' MUSBPUMT
			A. FEW REASONS WHY THE BRlTISH MUSEUM
			SHOULD BE PRESERVED fL ITS ACIIENIT fiY- TEGRITY, AS BY LA.W ESTAETABrsHFD
			From the ttnh of te foundation of the British Museum, more than a century ago, ib has been a depository of objcts of n3turalhistory and of antiquitles of various kinds, united with books and manuscripts. As such it was institated, and the Act of Parliament (26th year of George IL) which gave it vitality declared that "the several collections, acdditions, and library, so received into the said generAl laboratory, shaU remain and be preserved therein, for public use to all posterity." In order to ensure this permanenceand to control the progress of the great national institution thus founded, trustees wvere appointed by the Act; some repre- sentln the chief public offices of the State in the person of Its Righ functionaries, and these, with the oeception of the Archbishop of Canterbury, were necessarily therefore, trustees only for the neried during which theY held offiice;- others wfere appointed ns the representatives of liberal bene- factors, to whose munificenco the British Musaum, in fact, mainly owved its origin.
			By a fresh enactment, these trustees were to bs the dle- tore of 15 more to be added to their number, and one in addiion was to be nominated by the Crown.
			So unwieldy a body eventuaUy had to be curtailed for the purposes of regular business, to transact which an improved Act, resulting from Royal Commission, directed the nomination by tbe trustees of 15 of their number, who were to act as a standing committee. These, in addition to the threeprincipal trustees-viz., the Archbishop of Canter- bury, the Lord-Chancellor, and the 3peak-er of the House of Commons, were to unudertake in facs the real administra- tion of the Museum.
			The century during which the Muscum has existed h3s been one unparalleled in respect of the gigantic progress which scientitic research hbus given to natural history ; while the increased wealth of the nation, and the advance in the cultivation of public taste, have during that period commu- nicated a great stimulus to the collection in the national Museum of objects connected with the purposes for which it was instituted. The natural history collections have in- creased to what are in fact several departments, each vying with and many surpassing the fine*t collections of their kind in other parts of the world. The hooks have expanded to a library highly woerthy of this coenutry, audthe manuscripts, the prints, and the antiquities are of equal ampDortance.
			The trustees have w atched this rapid progress of the col- lections u:der their care wvith a constant anxiety to meet the fresh requirements for space whieh thatprogressde- manded by gradual but continual accessions of ground con- tiguous to the Museum.
			Until recently the enlargements thus contemplated stoadDly progre=ssed. A chzk, however, was given to them by the premise of space within the Museu'm walls which wvas enltertained at least by those trustees whio represent natural history, on the occasion of MEr. Panizzi proposing his admirable schemne for converting the quladrangle of the Miuseum into w hat should he at onces a noble re.ading-room and a most comprehensivo library. By the carrying out of this scheme, which has been so eminently successful, a space was, it was hoped, to be created for the accesonto the library for the next half-century, and also that some of the large rooms now occupied by the old library were to have been devoted to the reception of other collections. This hope has not, however, been fulfilled.
			About the same time that the new library and rcadlnz- room were in the courso of erection, the question was raised, whether the collections of natural objects should not be separated from those devoted to the works of man ? Had this proposition cuerely contemplated the segregation of the Murseum into distinct parts, or into buildings contiguous to one another and Ito it, no naturalist could have oppose i the sunggestion. Indeed, thcse of the trustees who especialy take nn Interest an its natural history departments have always desired so to extend the building nor'hwards as to give to natural history a separate part of the luseum, though at the same time one in juxtaposition with the resc. But for the last four years no steps whatever have been tasken to carry out the recommendation of this committee;- it having been unmderstood that some great change w.as im- paending, and that nothing could be done in the way of as- commodation, adaptation, or improvement, until the deci- sion of the Government and the Parliameut twas obtained as to this intended operation. The miangement of the different departments of the Museum is assigned to distinot com- mittees of the trustees; and it is an important fact that the Committee for Natural History has always been unanimous in the opinion that it is of the utmost importance, with a viewto preserve the popular regard for, no less than to facilitate the study of, the collections of natural history, that those collections should not be removed from Bloomsbury. That they should be separated from the halls and galleries devoted to art need never necessitate their detachment from the great national library. It was under the influence of a similar conviction that in the year lS5S a very consider- able body of men of science .addressed to the Chancellor of t,he Exchequer the following document, embodying the opinions which had been unanimously advocated by the Natural History Committee of the Trustees:
			"S MEMOOOAL OF THlE PROMtOTERS AD CULTIVATORcS OF
			SCIENCE ON TIIE SIJBECT OF THE PRtOPOSZD SEVER- ANCE FRONI TIE BRITisH MusEust OF IrS NArTU1As. HISTORY COLLECTIONS; AVDDRESSED TO HIER MAJES- TY'S GOVERN\MENT.
			" The Report of the Rbyal Commission appointed to inquire into the best site for a National Gallery, and recent discussions in Parliament, having led to the contemplation of breaking up the British Museum by severing from it the Natural History Collections, we, the undersigned, pro- moters and cultivators of natural knowledge, beg to record our strong objections to such remeve], and for the following reasons:-
			"I. The British Museum, when established by Act of Parliament in 1755, was essentiaUy a Natural History Col- lection, the enlightened views of its founder, Sir Hans Sloane, being that it should ' be rendered as useful ns possible, as well towards satisfying the desire of the curious as for the improvement, knowlcdge, and information of all persons.'
			" H. The object of Sir Hans Sloane has been so satisFac- torily carried out that, aecordin5 to the Report of the last Royal Commission which inquired into the whole state of the Museum (1818), 'the evidence of men of the highest anthority in science was referred to with great satisfaction to show that the Natural History Collections were, as a whole. equal, if not superior to any in the world.'
			" IIL Whie we are avware that much greater space is re- quired to provide for the reception of antiquities and ancient scnlpture (chiefly on the ground floor), it has beenzscer. tained by the trustees that, when additional buildings shali be called for, they an be extended northwards in halls re- quiring little embeJlishment, and, according to a plan laid before the trustees by Mr. Smlirke, involving a considerably less expenditnre than that wvhich must ba incurred by a transference of tho3e collections to any other spot, and the consequent erection of an entirely new edifice. On this point we beg to quote the following resolnuions adopted by the trnstees of the British Museum, composing the standing committee, as ptinted in a return to the Honse of Commons dated the 4th of February, iSIS:-
			.. The committee having had under their consi4eration thS report of the principal Ibr3rian, dated 10th ot November, 1857, resolveL-
			" '1. That it appears from sach repars that there ls a great deficiency of spase at prosent for the proper oehiblilon of the different collectione in the different departments of the bluseum, and that there ie no vacant opaoo now belongins to the trLstcees which vwil be sufficient to srovide for such deficiency.
			2. That in provldlng an adequsat spson for that purpose it is vcre
			desirble to ontsemplate the tut-are ean progressive, n3 well us the actual and immediate, requlremoats of tbh BrItiah tuoenumL
			2 I S. That it appsase to the trustees that the best mode of provide ingfor ouch preset and future requiremeats wil be byadoptties the plan sebmitted by MIr. Smtirke for the purbhase of land to the north of the Museum, as contaecod in the report of the principal librarien.
			' "4. That in the opinton of the trustees, even if the Increase of the coltletlono whtoh uso under their caro should at eome fature time make it nesessary to trausfer any of those collections to some other place, the land of which the purchaee is now recommouded must alwaye be of great and peculiar value to the Museum.
			5 ' s. That suoh pt3n, together with the present resolutmoo, chill oe laid before Her Maiesty's Ministers, with the vlew of requesting their concurrence the:ein, and their recommendation thereof to the con- uideration ofParliament.'
			" IV. Presuming that few persons will be found to ad- vocate the removal of the grsnd masses of ancient art from their present position, so it is manifest that, if aU 'he Natu- ral History Collections be taken away, their transference wvi afford no placo for the classical works which now teem- poraritly encumber the principal falade, or crowd the crypta below ; for, as such massive objects must bh placed on the ground floor, so an extension of thebrsement is inevitable if the antiquities remain part of the Museum, and all that the Natural History Collections can require for their future de- velopment wiUl be an allotment of space above sach exten- sion of the ground floor.
			"We would also observe that the prolongatlon of the present building northwards, on the abovementioned plan, besides being much less costly than the formation of an en- tirely new building, will put a stop to all controversies re- specting the approprlate site; and the style of architecture to be appled to a new bailding.
			"V. In referenco to other suggestions that have been vaguely thrown out of the breaking up of the Natural Hiis tory Collections of thenationinte severalparts, by trans. ferriug, c.gr., the minerals, to the Government School of Mrines; the stuffedc animals to the Zoological Society; the insects and shells to the Licn ean Society, iso,, wre have first to observe that not any of the above institutions, two of which are only voluntary associations of individuals pos- sesses th space or means for the reception and display o such constituent perle of the great national series of u3tra- tions of nature; and, further, that aS the chief cod and aim of natural history is to demonstrate tho harmony which pervadesthe whole, and the unity of principlewhich be- speaks the unity of the creative cause, it is essential that the diffterent classes of natral objects should ho preser in jurtapocMon under the roof of one great buildinp
			"VI. We further strongly object to the propos trans- ference, because those engaged in the study of natural history have in the British iMuseum the paramount ad- vantage of consulting every work which can aid their re- searches; while a removal of the collections would either Involve a conjoint transference of a very large portion of the national library, or necessitate a very cxpensive pur- chase of a special natural history llbrary.
			" VII. While such aro among the prominent reasons agalnst tho removal of the Natural Histery CoUcetions from the site where they have been established for upwards of a century in the centre of London, we beg to add the expres. sion of our opidon, that such removal, particularly if to any situation distant from that centre, would be viewed by the mass of the inhabitants with extreme disfavour, it being a well-known fact that by far the greater number of visitors to tho Museum conslsts of those who frequent the halls con- taining the lNatural History Collections; while it is obvious that many of those persons who come from the densely Peopled districts of the eastern, northern, and southern Parts of London would feel it very inconvenient to resort to any distant locality.
			"bPor these reasons, as based on scientifio advantages
			the convenience and instruction of the people and the' saving of a large sum to the nation, we earnestly hope that the Natural History Collections may not bo interfered with, but be aLlowed to remain asociated with the many other branches of human. knowlodge which are so admirably re- presented In this great national establishment.
			" Her Majesty's Govermnent, we trast. wil never yield
			to the argument that, because In some countries the pro-. ducts of nature and art are exhibitedl in distinct establish- ments, therefore the like separation should be copied here. Let us, on the contrary, rejoice in the fact that we have realized what no other liigdom can boast of, end that such vast and harmoniously-related accurauIatlen of knowiedge is gathered together around a library, iluastrating each dle- partment of this noble museum.

			This docament, sined by so mnany distinguished men of science, including the Presidents of the chief scientific societies, was, Indeed, in the course of the autumnn of 1S5S, folowed by another, signed by eight leading naturalists three of whom had given their names to the previous memo rial. They asked for a reorganizatiou of the Nntural History Collections, aud with that a eLstinct adjuinistratirn of them. But, thoush thoy adverted to the then prevalent report, that the collections were to be transferred to 'another locallty,' the prayer of their memorial might in all essential respecte be fully complied with if the collec- tions were to remain where they are.
			"Recently a special general me-ting of the trustees vwa called to receive a report prepared by a sub-co nlitteo appointed to escert-an the relative expense of erectlug stuch building. as would eilbrace all that the eminent Superln tendent of the NAturel History Department consldered requiite for the diferent collections under his supervielon. The comnarlson was instituted between the expense of add- nDg to tfe present Aluseum to the extent of fide acres, and the cast of crecting a new muecum of similar extent on the only easily obtained "round w hich is situated on the south- western extremity of the laud at Kensington-gore, pur- chased by the Royal Commissioners of the Exhibition of LSI.
			"It has been recently stated in the Hlones of Common t that on that occasion, when 17 trusteess were present, the vote in favour of the removal of the Natural History Col- leations in Kensington was carried by a majarity of one only; and, as it was further stated that six Cabinet Minis- ters voted In that majority, it folows that the trustees, who are reaUy charged with the management of the Museum, and who may be asserted to have the Interests of the collec. tions most vividly present to their minds, constituted tho minority. It was, in fact, made a question of expenditure as balanced against the tree interests of science.
			M3embers of the Governmentprobably navytllini more of the relative importance to the country which 1.50,0001., or even 200,0001., may represent than of tho removal to a suburban district of the departments of Natural History. But the trustees who voted in the minority certainly repre- sented the feelings of men of science, and also, we believe, of a large metropolitan public, when they considered that a central position in London, propinquity to the great na- tional library, and the maintenance in the eye of the publin in the middle, as it were, of their daily pathl, of our noble colections of natural history, was of more iuportance for that public than the sum of money to which the interests of science were to be postponed.
			"But even the argument drawn from economy, vhich is the mun argument that has been ostensibly put forward, loses much of its importance when criticaUy investigated.
			"It is doubtless true that the pur.haso of land covered with houses at Bloomsbury must involve a larger outlay than the acquisition of a similar extent of grass land at Kensington; but, on the other hand, it is to be borne in mind that the purchnas of tho hitter and the cost of the neow building must both be paid for at onco or in the ensuing three or four years, whereas the extension hitherto contemplated by the trustees around the Mfuseum involves only a gradual acquisition of the ground, and consequently an expenditure extending over many years. The design for sucl as extension and for the bui3dings contemplated in it wou-ld, indeed, bo formed on a complete and comprehem-ive plan, but all that wonld he necessary for the present towards carrying that plan out wvould consist in the securing tho ultimato reversion of the land, and in the purchase for immediate requirements of a comparatively smail number of leases. The fortunate cir- cumstance that the land required is all the property of one nobleman would doubtless render the ultimate acquisition of the reversion of it by the British Museum a simple negotiation.
			"Furthermore, the extpense of removal and the risk of niury to the colectlons, no less than the years that must nsue during which no relief can ho afforded to the existing establishment-years during7 which the f*c~ade must remain
			eneunmbered, as it now is, with the antiquities of Halicar-
			nasusn,-are no light arguments against the project of break- ing up the establishment. When to these considerations is added the additonal expense involved in the formation of a s;ientific library-to say nothing of the costliness of the facade of a new building,-assuredly the gradual though systematic extension of tho British Museum northwards for the natural history, an,d wrestward for the antiquities, the nuinterrupted exhibition to the publoc of the collections ven while that extension is going forward, and thepro- found coavietion on the part of so many men of scienco that the welraro of science is involved in this extension, aro arguments to which an economy of a few tens of thousands Is no answer.
			'1Undoubtedly the multitudes who inhabit the more densely populated regions of the metropolis-so large a frac- tion of the British nation-would share in the disappoint- ment of scientific men at the removal of tbesNatural History Collections from a spot so near to the centre of the great metropolitan orea, to the western extremity of the Kensing- ton grounds, wvhere the entrance to the new musearm would be nearly half a mile beyond the existing South Kensington or Brompton Museum.
			"The complaint that the British Mufsenm presents now a confused medley of heterogeueous collections, even if it were just, would be a very different thing from declaring the advisabilityof separatingthoase coDections by thewhole length of the radius of lbondon. But the public, whose interests are in fact most deeply concerned, will probably prefer the middle course, an, wiU concur with the sentiments abovo expressed in favour of separation without removal,-of a distinct administrative seParation of the thr-ee great series of colections, the Natural History, the Antiquarian, and tbe Bibliographical, so that cach may form a department entire in itself, but conti"uous to the others, thc great Readlng- room and Library Formlnt the nucleus and centre of union for tho whole. The Briash Muceum will then still remain the rich storehouse of knowledge, to be read in books and to be illustrated by colections, which has hitherto made it an anique Institution, of which every Xnglishman fools heanay he proud, and to which every foreign traveller bends his steps, as giving him at once a general view of the intel- ligence, enterprise, and practical sense of thin nation.

			FRBIAR BACON.$
			If any one were asked v who was the greatest phi- losopher of the middle ages, the reply would pro- bably be Thomas Aquinas, "theangelie doctor." And the reply might be allowed to pass, in the sense that he was the greatest mnster in that peculiar line of thought for w hich the middle ages are distin_uished. In a more absolute Eense, however, there was a philosopher living in the same century who was infi- nitely superior to the angel of the shools, and who vwas, perhaps, the greatest genius that flourished betwieen tho fall and the revivel of letters-Roger Bacon, "the wonderful doctor." The fate of the doctor
			lass been as wonderful as his name. as a thinker, heI was several centuries before his time; he despised 1 the jangling of the schools; and it was not to be expected that a generation which saw in Aquinas the perfect glory of the human intellect should see in Friar Bacon much more than the unlawful wisdom of a magician. He naturaUy failed of winning the unhesitatin,g applause of con- temporaries against whose modes of thought his
			philosophy was an incessant protest. Nor did he I fare much better with succeeding generations. By the time that it was possible to appreciate his phi-
			losophy in this country and to see how he towered ! above] all his contemporaries Roger Bacon was in.' every sense of the word obsolete. The greater and; better part of his works existed only in manuscript; ! his manuscripts were written in a dead language; and what a poor Friar had consigned to adead lan- guage amid the darkness of the 13th century wasnot likely to have much living relationship with the ferment of the 17(th. It thus followed that he was as much underrated in an onlightened age as he had been in a dark one. To the age in which he lived his words were foolishness; to the age
			that afterwards came, and was able to un-I derstand him, his words were truisms. The man who was as truly the forerunner and BaDtist of modern thought as WVycliffe was of Protestant faith, and in whose writings we have as clear an exhibition ot English feeling as in Chauccr we have the well of English undefiled, is scarcely known in popular esteem but as the hero of the fable of the brazen head that spoke. i
			In lauding Friar Bacon as the vreatest man of his age, the full significance of this fact, that lie failed to impress either his contemporaries or his succes- sar3 with a sense of his superiority must not be forgotten as going in the balance against him. It was more than a misfortune; it was a de- fect. Little as we can now sympathize with the learned subtleties of Aquinas, yet we can under- stand the graudeur of the mind that in perfect accord with the tendencies of the age could control and direct these, leaving his mark upon them for ever. WVe may, from the height of our v-isdom, laugh at the scholastic philosophy, but there is no denying the good which it effected in an age of credulity and superstition. It was a healthy assertion of the rights of reason in tho province of faith. When men were fast slippiog into the most absurd' mysticism and bending with the most abject sub- mission before the voice of authority it was a great thing to assert, even in extravagant fashion, that reason had some claims, and that the human mind had some little power. NVhat if it were true that: human reason could really never discover how many , angels might dance on the point of a needle? N\That: if it were true that reason could never really justify the doctrine of Transubstautiation, or explain the mystery of the Trinity? Still, the vigorous attempt to render our beliefs rational, to malke the syllogismus of Aristotle square with the prerogatives of St.
			Peter, to make the greatest of heathen philosophers' cross-examine the chief of the Apostles, was of im-
			uense moment, and the hero in wliom this medi-eval movement culminated is worthy of our veneration. As we turn over the pages of Roger Bacon we find how little sympathy he had in this, the great intel-! lectual movement of his age. To some extent, in- i deed, he does rationalize. For example, in the 41st chapter of the OpVs Te,-linm, now for! the first time published, he enters into an' argument to prove that the world is not
			intinitelv extended. He plays upon the subtle- I ties which logicians so well understand-proving that infinite lines, which ought to be equal to each other, are less or greater than each other, until at
			last we arrive at the monstrous conclusion that the I line which is less is really the greater, and that the part is more than the whole. Therefore there is no such thing as infinite distance, and the world is not infinite. But this is not usually Roger Bacon's method. He worshipped observation and fact more
			than reason and authority. he is always appealing to facts; he is always discussing evidence; he is too busy writh the an s-it ? to think of the cur sit ? The age was not prepared for such a philosophy. The age accepted its facts implicitly, jast as It accepted its faith. If reason was admitted into court, it was for the purpose of explaining and justifying, not of questioning the authorized creed and the accredited facts. Friar Bacon did not in any way ally himself with this movement and turn it to account. He started a new and Dremature movement, than which nothinEg could be more alien to the -pirit of the timues. The faculty of observation is ot.e that must necessarily be developed in poetry and art before it can be tuirned to the account of science. The popular mind must take an interest in facts before it cares to explain them. The de- scriptions of the poet and the imitations of the painter must habituate a people to accurate obser- vation of nature before a philosopher can excite much sympathy in insistinz upon the importance of fact. floux was Friar Baron situated in this re- spect? He wlho was the lherald of English science came a century before hiin w-ho was the herald of English poetry. Chaucr'r is the first of our poets in whom we see thu close obscrver ard tbe faithful painter-the man of fact, who would deseend to tell us of the wart on a miller's nose, and trust to the aeccuracy of his description as a sure source of amusement. It is by these observatiors for the purposes of fancy that a people are educated to ap- preciate facts and to study nature. Now, in Friar Bacon's time nature was not studied and facts were not appreciated. WVhat poetry there was belonged to the lyrical kind, and what representation of natu- ral objects architecture encouraged was symbolic rather than real; so that wlhen the great philosopher of the 13th century insisted upon fact and experiment in anticipation of his great namesalke of a liter age, his words fell lifeleFs on the ears of a people wvho had not yet learued to dwall uipon facts evenin ima, nation. The temper of the centiury was exhi- bited not merelv in tih' absence of descriptive poetry and naturalistic art-it was palpable in the secrecy with which it Lvas the custom to shroud important facts. One miigt invent a powerful argument or
			sfuggest a subtle quiestion, and aU Europe was inte-I rested in the theme-the whole world might know the result. To mnake a newv discovery, however, was a difHerent alh,ir. There was a propertv in facto, and knowledge was a sacred thing. Friar Bacon was bound by the rules of his order not to divu,lge his knowledge, and he had to get a dispensa- tion from the Pope before he could venture to pub- lish his worLs. or communicate his information even to the oly FFather. When he set himself to record what he knew, evern then he had to conceal his more precious facts in an anagram. WVhat was tho use of appealing to facts if facts were to be secret? WVhat could nature do for the philo- sopher if her treasures were to be concealed? Friar Bacon, as a philosopher, insisted on the value of facts, and, as a 5inorite, consented to the con- cealment of his knowledgo. He was bound hand and foot. He was in a false position. He went too far for his age, and he did not go far enough for his fame.
			Whilo Friar Bacon had so little real hold upon the age in which he lived, it is not easy to pronounlce positively as to his indluence on succeeding genera- tions. Directly, indeed, his influence appears to have been sufficiently slight. Indirectly, however, it has been suggested that our debt to him is enormous. The resembLance between him and his greater name- sake is so striking- that the question has been raised whether the latter may not have received a strong though unacknowledged impulso from brother Roger. It was Mr. Hallam vwho started this line of nquiry, and it has been followed up by other wrnters who are not indisposed to add to the list of enormities committed by " the brightest wisest, meanest of mankind," the crime of plagiarism. Even if the Chancellor bad been acquainted with the writings of the Friar, and had borrowed largely from them, he wouild have merit onoug-h to satisfy the most ardent of his admirers. His was a mind of sucl wealth that an accusatiorn of plagiarism brought against him may bh treated with not less sncitTerence than the similar charge advanced against Shakspeare because lie derived the plots of his dramas

			from Italian novels. Any ono who would reall
			wound the reputation of Lord Bacon by an indict- ment of this kind must go deeper, ard explain away how the author of the Noeutm (OrgatuLr/; bore eO Close a resemblance in mental character not less than philosophical method to his monkish namesake. We find in both the same encyclopmcdic tendencies, the same craving for facts, the same curiosity in experi- ments, the same belief in thetriumphs hereafter to be achieved by adhering to the safo line of truth, the same rashness in admitting facts that are doubtful, the same sense of the marvellous in combination with a regard for matter of fact, often, too, the same turns of expression and the same habits of iUustration. For expression iallam has quoted the celebrated phrase " prmrogstivni scientiarum," as firstused by Friar Bacon, and has given apassage beginningwith the words " Duo aunt modi cognoscendi scilicet, per
			.rgnmentum et experimentum," in which we hear distinctly the Baconian ring. We will add a sen- tence from one of the works now publisbed for the first time (Opus Tertium, cap. XXVL), in which the sort of appeal to the imagination which the illustra- tion makes is of the true Baconian order :-" Sed considerare debemus quod verba habent maximam potestatem; et ominia miracula facta a principio mundi fere facta sunt per verba." On the whole, the resemblances between the two Bacons are too start- ling to be passe-I over as mere coincidences ; while, on the other hand, they are so numerous and extend to such traits of character that one cannot satisfa- torily account for them by the theory of plagiarism. The most tempting of all theories is that of the transmigration of souls-Bacon the Friar and Bacon the ChanceUor being only avatars of one and the same personage. Place the Chancellor In the 13th century, and he would have flattered the Pope, he would have complained of the ignorance of the learned,he would have scoffed at the schools, he would have discoursed onburning glasses, onsaltpetre, and the philosopher's egg, he would have discovered the camera, and he would have dis-,uised his information in intricate anaorams. Pla&amp; the Friar in the 17th century, and he would have glorified the British Solomon; he would have urged on the advancement of learning, he would have described with aU detail a new scientific method, and he might have died from the effects of a cold caught in stutfing a fowl with snow. Lord Bacon, in the 11th centuiry, sneered at the syllogism, and scouted the scholastic philosophy. Friar Bacon had not got quite so far, but he wished that aU the translations of Aristote were burned, and that his contemporaries would, in their study of the Greek philosopher, discard the follies of interpreters and commentators. In view of the happy results to flow from the pursuit of science in the right direction, the Friar became not less enthusiastic than his illustrious namesake. He pre- dicted a time when the Church of God should be purged from fraud and contention, when justice should reign and prosper, when the Greeks and the Latins should be reconciled, vrhen the Tartars should be converted, when the Saracens should be destroyed, and when all should become one fold under one shepherd.
			Among the very valuable series of publications for which wo are indebted to the Master of the Rolls, and which is offered to the world at a price that, considering the sumptuousness of the paper, print, and binding, must ba considered fabulous- namely, Ss. 6d. a volume-there is not one that wll be more eagerly welcomed than the present collec- tion of Roger Bacon's inedited works. Bacon was invited by Pope Clement IV., who had heard of his wisdom, to make an exposition of his system. This he did in three works, which are severally known as the Opus dIajus, the Opus .MfiUTus, and the Opus Ter- tiem. The first of these works w,as published about a century ago, and it is from this laborious treatise, which, beginning with grammar and mathematics, goes on to discuss the principles of geography, chro nology, astronomy, meteorology, arithmetic, music, hydrography, and optics, that our beat idea of the philosopher is derived. Scarcely had he finished this work and despatched it by a trusty messenger to Rome, wvhen Bacon, fearful that he had not ex- pressed himself with sufficient clearness, or that his book might be lost in its journey, set himself to compose a second treatise, called the Opus Minus, now for the first time printed. Unfortunately, the only manuscript of it in existence is but a frag- ment, and the transcriber was utterly incompetent to his task, so that the remains which are now given to the world are not a little mutilated. The loss, however, is not so great as if the work had been a substantive treatise. It was intended by the author to be a sort of abstract of bis larger work, contain- ing here and there additional or explanatory matter. In the same year he produced the Opus Terfiutm, in- tended as a preamble to the two previous works. Mr. Brewer, who has been charged with the preparation of the two latter w, orks, and who has supplied us with a very interestina biblio-
			g-apoacaL pretace, has ptaced this preamble, in spite of its title, first in the volume. Preliminary in its nature, the account which it affords of Bacon's trials and difficulties, the sums he expended in pro- secuting his studies, and the straits to which he was put in transcribing his work, is as valuable as it is amusing; and we may wefi be astonished to find that the energetic friar triumphed over every ob- stacle, and finished his three works (the largest, as published last century, extending to nearly 500 folio pages) in about a year and a-half. To these treatises MIr. Brewer has added the fragment of an encyclo- pmdic work which the friar afterwards projected, which is here entitled the Coomnendium Philosophice, and which was intended to embrace the whole science of the period, from grammar to agriculture, and from medicine to morals.
			These curious works give us most interesting glimpses into the philosophy of the Mliddle Ages. a nd they will greatly heighten the reputation of the genius who stands forth in such solitary gran- deur from out the epoch of Aquinas. It is im- possible to read a page of this man's writings without feeling that we are in the power of a mind that differs from the other minds of that period as a flowing river from a rolling cloud. In general the scholastic philosophers have interests far re- moved from ours, speak a language that is incom- prehensible to us, and seem to be lost in some strange cloudland where we have no desire to follow them. Roger Bacon's language is singular for its clearness and its force. lHe writes very bad Latin, it is true, but it is not nearly so bad as the current Latin of the time; it is not harsh nor crabbed, and to an Englishman it has the meri' of being familiar. It is, in fact, the idiom of modern English expressed in Latin words. The student of English literature, who would understand by what sort of compromise between Latin and Anglo-Norman the English lan- guage was at length formed, the vocables being for the most part Saxon, should read sueh a work as this, in whicb, the vocables being chiefly Latin, we see a similar compromise effected by a philosopher who, writing in the universal language of Christen- dom, wvas ovidently thinking in his mother tongue. Expressing himself with the directnessand force of our modern dialects, Friar Bacon takes a modern reader by the practical character of his thought, and by his contempt for the intelectual pursuits of the men by whom he was surrounded. A most learned man himself, perhaps the most learned of his time, he complained bitterly of the smattering of knowledge which in his day was called science, of the jangling of the schools, of the foDly of the preachers, of the universal ignorance of Greek, of Arabic, of Hebrew, and of other lan- -,uages with which wise men erero content, and wvhich was even defended on the ground that these were the languages of infidels, of magicians, and of Jews. There are not five men in Latin Christendom, he says, who are acquainted with the Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic Grammar. There are only two perfect mathematicians, he says, elsewhere, and there are only two other tolerable ones. The sub- ject of optics, he says to the Pope, is totally unknown to the generality of men. It is a science that has not hitherto been read at Paris or among the Latins, except twice at Oxford in England; and there are not three persons acquainted with its power. NVe havo already alluded to the inconsistency of the man who could write iu this way, who could complain of the universal ignorance, who could appeal to facts and experiments, treating his know- ledge and his facts as secrets which it would be well notto divulge to too many persons. Addressing the Pope on the subject of magic, he says that he has expounded his views at greater length in a parti- cular chapter of a previons work, " where I have touched upon the great secrets of nature which are not to be indiscriminately divulged to al] men."
			Notwithstanding his acquirements, which placed him high above his contemporaries, the Franciscan Friar was essentially a humble man. When he condemns the ignoranco of the men by whom he is surrounded, and when he announces in the most dogmatic way the fewness of the number who on any one subject are equally learned with himself, hI, no doubt, praises his own proficiency, but as
			we read on vwe discover that he had a far higher object-an anxiety to protest against the ignor- ance which was common and to enforcea the claims of a superior knowledge which none knew so well as he how to appreciate. In one remarkable passage of the Tertium Opus, after de- scribing the difficulties in the face of which he edu- cated himself, and after stating that from the time he had learned his alphabet he had devoted 40 years to science and languages, he says that, in three, or at the moat, in six months, he could impart all he knew to an industrious man of good memory. pro- vided he had previously compiled certain'tables of analysis which his pupil should follow from the first, and consult from time to time. This period of time would be required to learn the sciences, but for the acquisition of the languages a much more limited space would suffice. In three days he could teach a docile pupil Hebrew so that he might be able to understand whatever had been written on the sacred text. In three more days he wvould instruct the same wonderful pupil in Greek, so that he would read and under- stand whatever pertains not only to theology, but also to philosophy and the Latin lan- g^uage. In a wveek he would teach geometry, and in another week arithmetic. Assertions such as these seem to indicate either that the author had not much to impart to any pupil, or that he was boasting unwisely. We are inclined, however, to put a different interpretation on them, and to accept them as genuine evidences of the writer's simnpli- city-the confession of a great mind that, after all his toil, the knowledge he had acquired was but a very little thing.
			Contrasted with this true modesty was tho false modestv of bending implicitly to authority which was characteristic of the age, and from which he was in a great measure free. He was not, indeed, entirely emancipated from the superstitions of his epoch, hut it is very pleasant to see how fearlessly he resists authority and claims for himself the right of discovering and asserting truth though aU the world, and all the fathers and all the saints were against him. It was no objection, he said, to his teaching that he advanced novelties. All novelties are at first suspicious, and the saints are not always right. Aaron and liriam resisted Moses, and yet they were saints. All the saints and wise men condemned Jerome's translation of the Bible, and said that he had falsified and corrupted the Scriptures. Even St. Augustine said many bit- ter things of him. Yet Jerome's translation pre- vailed in the end. St. Gregory wanted people to burn theirbooks. The theologians atParis condemned and excommunicated the writings of Aristotle. Such is human frailty that even the saints are not porfect. Therefore, if the fathers do not approve of philosophy-" non miror. cunm aliud tempubs fiait tzunc, et aliuzd 1u7C est." Cor,ceive of a friar of the 13th century uttering such a remark as that ! The fathers-the saints, might speak for themselves; but this is another time of day. The passage which we have thus paraphrased is in the Opzus Tertium (cap. IX.) and the work is full of such bursts which have a simplicity and raciness in the original Latin that no translation can adequately render. For perhaps the most characteristic passage in the whole volume we may refer the reader to tbe close of the 13th chapter of the same work, in which the Friar sounds the trumpet in favour of experimental philo- sophy, and of one who had given great attention to it, Peter de Maharncuria. After descanting on burning-glassem so powerful that a whole army of Tartars and Saracens might be destroyed by them, he says that this is no doubt strange, but there are many things even more won- derful that are revealed by the same science. Only very few persons can devote themselves to the science on account of the expense attending the ex- periments. There is hut one man, indeed, known to the Friar who has seriously laboured in it; and he-having no interest in speechifying and word fights-turns to wiser occupations, and there rests his mind. And, so, what others blindly strive to Eee, he sees clearly, because he is a master of experiment (propter h4c quod est domznus experimentorum); and in this way he knows by experience (scit per experienstiamn) natural philo- sophy and medicine and alchemy, and indeed every- thing, whether in heaven above or in the earth be- neath. Nay, he woald be ashamed if any common person-if a rustic-knew of the country more than he does. And then the Friar enters into greater detail, and states all the objects of know- ledge in which the master of experiments took his chief delight. All these objects are summed up under the name of natural science, and it is this that he describes as true wisdom when he contrasts it with the discussions of the schools and the orations
			or sne puspit, in words whic sound so strangely in the flourishing era of scholasticism, " ipse ?Wn curat de sermoribus et plc(qnis vcrboarw,, sed perscqztitur opera sapientice, et in illis quiescit." In that sentence lies the whole of the Baconian philosophy, and read- ing such expressions, one is tempted to ask whether the Friar is not as much a Baconian as the Chan- ceUor. Indeed, if Lord Macaulay's view of Francis Bacon's contributions to philosophy be correct, Rloger Bacon was not much outdone by his successor and namesake. Macaulay has maintained with can- siderable ingenuity that Bacon's analysis of the in- ductive process was of very little use, for we all go through the process unconsclously-the most ignorant man being a'ole by an inductive method to arrive at the conclusion when he is il that mince- pies have done the mischief. We do not think that this position is tenable, butthe fact that it has been advanced by such an authority-the fact that Lord Bacon's claim to our admiration and gratitude has been placed on the sole ground that he saw the ad- vantage of prosecuting physical science, and urged the importance of careful observation-will show, to some extent, the value of Roger Bacon's philosophy and the force of his character, who in the 13th cen- tury followed the same instinct, taucht the same doctrine, ancd foresaw the same splendid results.

			COURT O BANKRUPTCY, Basing7lvUstcrat, ApriU IL
			_ L - EN RE SRY WATTS.
			(Before Mr. CoInmfiev oOrwnvmI
			Xne bankrupt was a draper at Northampton. sis at- counts, prepared by Messrs. Paul and Turner, commenced November, 1858, with a surplus of 9S41., and closed with debts 14,03.; assets about 7,0001.
			It appeared, from the bankurapt's examination by Mr. HAID WICK, that two years ago he commenced selling goods by auction. The sales took place at towns a little distance from Northampton. If goods were not sold at one place they were taken to another. There was no fixed reserve price. Tried to get the heat price he could. Three-fourths of the goods mlght be new stock.
			Re-examined by Mr. I&amp;ws.-The bankrupt said that respectable ladies visited the sales. They preferred buying at a sale. Commenced by getting rid oE old stock, and gradually mixed new stock with it. If an insufficient bid were made he (bankrupt) was there to see that no sale was effected. Endeavoured to realize a profit. Sometimes there was a small loss, but that was always covered by subsequent profits. As a general rule the goods were sold at cost price.
			The bankrupt then passed his examinatlon.

			IMIDDLESEX SESSIOYVS, ApKZ 1L
			A gsreat -nu-mber of oases, in' whtoh the prisoners for the chloef part pleaded guilty, were disposed of by the two C;ourts. Those who were old offenders were sentenced either to psns.l servitude or lengthened terms of imprison- toent, The committal of juvenile offenders this semion was unusually large, and in every case where it was hpracticable the Court passed a sentenco which wouldl send tha prisoner to some reformatory institution, the County Industrial School, or to Parkhnrst.
			John Sewell, 40, described as a stablemain, but who badl been a master livery atablekseeper, -was indicted for feloni- ously embezzling the several sums of 31. Sc,, .51. 10s. 6d., 51. 14s., and aiso other sums, amounting in the aggregate to nearly 2001.
			Mr. Metcalfe prosecuted, instructed by Mr. Wontner; and Mr. F. H. Lewis was cou-nsel for the prisoner.
			It appeared that the prlsoner formerly was the proprielor of some liv-ery stables in Glocester.mews North, but, having fallen into difficulties, which he could not meet, the sheriff eventually went in under an executIon for over I65., which the prosecutor, a corn dealer in raoed-street, Paddingion, between whom endl tho prisoner there had boon some busi- nesa transactions, paid out; and as the prisoner, af ter molting a compromise even, could not go on, the prosecutor bought the business, part of the consideration being the amount paid under the execution. The Droscsutor, under the agree- men't, took possession of the prisoner's stables and working stock, to which he considerably addedI on his own acouDnt, .an a further agreement was entered into by which the pri- soner became the servant of the prosecutor, at a salary of 11.2s.perwek, n aditonso hathewould receive as
			spee. of the business the prosecuto' evn;ta ho. was to render a just, true,ad cuat c count of all orders received and executed, and of all moneys received from customers to the sole account of the prosecu- tor. After that the prosecutor found all the mleans re- quired to carry on the business, provided additional herses and brosighams, corn, &amp;c., and mnade out his own bills, which he gave, in some, instances, to the prisoner to receive the mone, ad, f curs. h wa toaccuntto him when he reeive th moey.Theprione, hwevr,made out other
			out n te nme f Swdl. Tesematershaving come to the prosecutor's k-nowledge the prisoner was questioned about them, and he admitted come particular instances men- tioned, and afterwards acknow,ledged that he had received money for which he had not accounted to Mr. Booth since the business clban"ed hands to the amount of 2001. at least. WVhen askecd wKsat he had done with the money he said he had been !advancing loans to friends, and the rest hehad spent in "gay life" with women. It should be statedI tha.t the prosecutor paid the sheriff out and took to the business in February, 1859, since which time the pri- soner had been his paid servant.
			Mr. LEwis, in cross-examination, put some questions upon his instructions with the view, apparently, of eliciting from the prosecutor that the agreement for a service was a mere blind ; that the prisoner remained a principal not- withstanding, and that there were matters between them
			whc utified his receiving and detaining this money for himusel.Every one of these questions met with a direct negative from the prosecutor, whoso evidence was given with the utmost clearness, who producedI his account books and papers, and the prisoner's own receipts for Isis wages from the date of the agreement.
			Mr. LEWirs said he had cross-examinedl according to the instructions the prisoner had furnished the attornoy with
			but after the evidence of the prosecutor, which couild not be, as he considered, In the least impugned, he should simply cay if the jury belleved It, and he could not see the least reason why they shouldl not, they would convict, the pri- soner; If they did net, or doubted it, they would scguit. His instructions bad entirely failed.

			Tepoeutor,hkin answer to the Court, stated that up to the prezent time his actual lees of mioney received by the prisoner was 1S861. Sc. 4d., as far as he ha~d ascertained.
			The AssSsrNTr JUDGE said the offence of emnbezzlement w2s at all times a serious one, but this case was net only of a seirious description, bult it had beon scandalously aggra- vated by the defence the prisoner hadl given instructions to be set up. N ot content with plundering a man who hadl been most kind to him, he made the most atrocouos asper- sions upon hima for which there was not the least founda- tiona. The sentence upon him was three years' penal ser- vitude.

			WYhen originally heard Mr. Kent deposed to the fact of his having d'scounted the bill upon the faith of her de- claration that the was a widow, and added that he had since received informuationthat shewas a married woman. As heivas not prepared with any evidence to support this asser tion, the prisoner was remanded for a week on her own recognizances, to give him an opportunity of strengthening his case.
			Mr. Kent, however, now aslked for a further remand, upon the Lround that he had not yet succeeded in providing himself with the requisite proof, although he still hoped to do so.
			Mr. Lewis, for the prisoner, strongly objected to this course, asserting that she had only been given into custody as a ruse, and that immediately after her leaving the court on the previous occasion sho was arrested and held in cus- tody for three days at Whitecross-street until her friends found a sum of 301. odd in her behalf.
			Mr. Kent persisted in asserting that he had a bondfide case, but
			Sir R. OAnDEw said that there was nothing whatever before the Court to support the charge, and
			The prisoner (who indignantly repudiated the assertion that she was not a widow) was therefore discharged.
			The LonD Ms.yop requested the acknowledgment of 2Ss. from " B. and W. S."

			GUiLDTIALL.-A-n Ridley, a little girl, whose age was stated to be 11 years, was charged with the following offence:-
			Mrs. Squires, the wife of a coal porter, living at No. 11, Blackhorse-coart, Fleet-street, said,-About half-past 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon I saw the prisoner sitting on my doorstep. She had something under her shawl, and on seeing me she went away, at the same time shaking her hand to a chld who was there asifwishinghergood-by. Shortly afterwards the landlady brought a litble girl down, who had been stripped of her clothing, upon which I said it must have been done by the girl I saw, and I immediately went in search of the prisoner, andfond herin Shoe-lane. I gave her into custody.
			Alderman HA.LE.-Had she the clothes in her possession when you found her ?
			Inspector Howard.-No, Sir. She had pawned them, and the tickets were found upon her.
			Alderman HALE (in great surprise).-Pawned them Is the pawnbroker present ?
			Inspector Howard.-Yes, Sir.
			Mfrs. Byrne, of 2, Bouverie-street, the mother of the child who was robbed of her clothing, said.-My child is only four years old, and it appears the prisoner took her from my door and inveigled her into a watercloset at the house of the last witness, and there stripped her of her

			Alderman iALs.-Thi' is rather a mysterious case. Eow far is Blackhorse-court from Bouverie-street9
			Inspector Eoward.-It is near the Farringdon-stroet end of Fleet-street.
			Alderman HALE.-I can hardly understand how a little girl like the prisoner conld get the chUd so far, and across a great thoroughfare like Fleet-street.
			Inspeetor lEoward.-Although the child is only four years
			of age she iS Intelligent, and has more the manner and quick- ness of an old woman In describing what took place. At the station I ask-ed her if she would know the girl again who robbed her, and she was about to say sbe did not think she should, when her eye caught sight of the prisoner, and she instantly exclaimed, " Oh, yes ; that is the girL"
			Thomas Cartland said,-IamUassistant toMr. Payne, pawn- broker of Shoe-lane. I have been with him about eight years. I produce a child's cotton frock, pledged for ls.
			Alderman 1,ALE.-Dld you take in this pledge?
			MWtess. -I did, Sir; but I did not write the tickets. Alderman HIALE.-Wlom did you take It of?
			Witness.-A girl who appeared bigger than the prisoner.
			Alderman HLE.-It was only yesterday afternoon. You must sorely recollect if it was the prisoner.
			*Witness.-I think the prisoner is the same girl; but I certainly thought she was bigger.
			Alderman LEs.s-What addressdld she givo? Witness.-Dean-street, Fetter-lane, Sir.
			Inspector Howard.-I understand, Sir, that they ner-er oven asked. the girl her address, but put down the first they could think of, and when the mother of the child who was robbed went to Mr. Payne's to see the clothes that were in pledge they refused to show them, and were very insolent to both her and the eonstable who was with her.
			Alderman HALE.-Where is the worted jacket? Witness.-We did not have it, Sir.
			Insoector Howard.-The prisoner says she wrapped the frock'and the jacket in her apron and pledged them all in one parceL Other pawnbrokers in the neighbourhoed give nS every facilty in similar cases, but this Is not the first time that Mr. Payne's people have bebaved in this way.
			Witness.-As soon as the constable came we showed him the frock; but we were annoyed because they seemed to doubt our word.
			Alderman HALE.-And they seem to have had good reason for doubting your word.
			Policeman 33G.-When I called at Air. Payne's, Sir, this witness wvas very impertinent to me.
			Alderman BALE.-As far as the pawnbroker ig con- cerned, I think this is a case in whicl, he should be sum- moned by the police for unlawfually taking in a pledge of a child under 16 years of age.
			Inspector Howard.-That shall be done, Sir.
			Cartland.-I can assure you, Sir, it is quite a mnistake, as it occurred in the hurry of business. We took in over 400 pledges yesterday.
			Inspector Howard.-Tho prisoner has given about five addresses, not one of which is correct, and we cannot find out anything about her,
			Springate (the gaoler).-I have seen her with other girls *of the same age hanging about the Mansion-house, to see tho prisoners go away in the van.
			Aldersman HALE.-Very well; I will remand her for further inquiry, so that I may deal with her at the hearing oft the snummons against the pawnbroker.

			Evidence was gone into which 'went to show that the prlsoner had been several months in the service of the prose- cutor as maid-of-all.work. On Wednesday, the 4th inst., he missed the money, &amp;e., alluded to, and without loss of time gave information to the police. The inspector promptly took steps to make the robbery known far and near, and he at length received Intelligence that a man named John Wailer was in custody at Waltham Abbey, at which place he had been taken up on suspicion of having improperly come bv a noto for 100Z. and other moneys which were found in hig possession. The note had been brought up by the chief officer from the place named, and lt was identified by the prosecutor as being his. It was farther shown that the man Waler had repressnbed himself to be the husband of the paisener, and thatbe hwas therefore a frequent visitor at the house, at which he had often by permission slept;- he had not, however, been near the place since the cash, &amp;;o.,
			The prisoner, on being asked what she had to say, replled -I know nothing at all about the robbery.
			Inspector Dafter said that the man WaUler was formerlyv e ice-constable In the S divilon and he (the inoretar)
			ded, that the charge would, no doubt, be completely esta- blished, in the event of a few days being allowed in order that he might bring up the male prisoner.
			Mr. BnosuGnIToo remanded the prisoner till Wednesday next.

Air.ey, R.C.B., Quartermaster-General; Major-General. yre, com- xnandant of the garrison, and a number Df other officers, was occupied until late on Tuesday evening in making a complete inspection of the fortifications and other works of defence connected with the garrison of Chatham. Imme- diately aftez the close of the inspection his Royal Highness made a complete circuit of the garrison with the view of examining the several localities best adapted for the erec- tion of works of defence for the protection of the garrison. His Royal Eighness also inspected the fortifications erected In the neighbourhood of the dockyard, which the Govern- ment has decided on considerably extendiag by the formation of additional batteries and works of de- fence on St. Mary's Island, for the protection of that portion of the dockyard and garrison open to an attack from the sea. After spending several hours in the ex- amination of the garrison defences, his Royal Highness, accompanied by the officers above enumerated, almost imme- diately proceeded through Chatham and Rochester, and inspected the lfne of country between the Thames and the Medway, where it is proposed that fortifications shall be erected, and in the neighbourhood of which the Govern- ment has recently purchased a considerable district, for the purposes of a long range rifle practising ground for the troops belonging lo Chatham garrison, who are to be hutted near the spot during the time they are nadergoing their tn- strtction. His Royal Highness returned to Chatham gar. rIson about 7 o'clock on Tneaday evening, and remained that night at Government-house, the official cesidence of General Eyre, a distinguished party of officers meeting his Royal HIghness at dinner.
			His Royal Highness the Dfke of Cambridge yesterday paid a visit of inspection to Sheerness. At 10 40 a.m. a Royal salute from all the ships in commission was fired as his Royal Highness passed down the river Medway on board the Commander-in-Chief's steam-tender Wildfire, under command of Master-Commander George Brockman. A guard of honour, composed of part of the Norfolk Militia Artillery received his Royal Highness on landing at the Ordnance-camber. His Royal Highness and staff pro.
			ceeded to the residenee of the Commander-in-Chief, Vice- Admiral of the Red Edward Harvey. The entire sea defences, fortifications, &amp;c., were first inspected by his Royal Highness and scientific officers, accompanied by Major-General Eyre, Commandant of Chatham Garrison; Deputy-Adit.-Gen. Bingham, Royal Artil- lery; Col. Nedham, Royal Artillery, Commandant of Sheerness Garrison ; Col. Montague, of Sheerness, Royal Engineers; Col. Laird and Capt. Boothby, of the Forfar and Lincardine Militia Artillery, and the entire staff of the garrison. The Forfar and theNorfolk Militia Regiments of Artillery were then Inspected on parade by his Royal High- ness, after which they were inspected on the centre seaward battery at heavy gun drill. The soldiers' bartacks and officers' quarters were minutely inspected by his Royal Highness. The principal objects of inspection by his Royal Highness and staff officers were the batteries seaward, and the general fortifications surrounding the fort, arsenal, &amp;c.
			The examination of candidates for direct commissions by the Council of Mllitary Education commenced yesterday before Major-General Rnmley, the Vice-President. and otEer members of the Council. There were above 100 can-

			The whole of the troops in Woolwich garrison having been granted a general holyday since the morning of Friday La.t (Good Friday), the usual field exercises and drills were recommenced yesterday morning. The four batteries form. ing the garrison reserve of 'he 4th field brigade of Artilery, were yesterday served with 10 rounds of blank ammunition, and assembled ou the review ground In command of Colonel Dick, when they were inspected and put through a course of active field exercises in the presence of General Sir Richard Dacres, commanding the garrison and staff. After the exercises the General proceeded to an Inspection of the stables and barrack quarters. The battalion of Royal Aarines was likewise marched to Woolwich-common in command of Colonel Hopkins, C.B., Aide-de-Camp' to Her Majesty, and went through a course of company drill.
			The chartered East India troopship Windsor Cas'le, 1,250 tons, Capt. Peare, w;hich arrived at Gravesend on Tuesday from Bombay, having on board a large number of soldiers who have been sent home from the various cavalry and infsntry regiments serving in Bombay, disembarked her troops on Tuesday afternoon, when they were forwarded to Chatham, where they arrived on the same evening. The Windsor Castle sailed from Bombay on the 3d of January Isst, touched at St. Helena on the 26th of February, and sailed three days after, the passage to the Thames occulpy- ing 99 days. The number of troops who embarked was 207.
			Yesterday morning upwards of 2,000 applicants for em- ployment again thronged the entrance to the Royal gun factories in Woolwich Arsenal, It having been announced that an additional number of artificers and labourers would be taken on in the department. An attempt was made to organize the Immense body into sectional columns or divi- sions of about 100 each, but the unruly desire which they exhibited to be foremost for examination rendered the attempt abortive. 250 or 300 were, therefore, hastily selec- ted and ordered for medical attestation, and the re- mainder were dismissed. As soon as the whole of the ma- chinery now in course of erection is in working condition the establishment wiUl be again increased to the full number intended to be added.
			The Iron paddle-wheel steam vesel Dover, late on service in the river Gambia, yesterday went down the Thames from Woolwich Dockyard cn an engineer'strial of her machinery, after thorough repairs, prior to being handed over to the Colonial Department.

			This now prosperous house is as forward as the rest in the prodaction of Easter novelty. The holyday burlesque, which Is on the subject of Lucrczia Borgia, has been written by Mr. Leicester Buckingham, who, while closely following the original story, has contrived to give it a happy conclun. sion. The piece is cast with the strength proper to the com- pany, Mr. Charles Young representing in his wonted gro- iesque style the Lair Lucrozia, lliss Wyndham appearing as a remarkably smart Gennaro, and Miss Ranoe looking formidable as the Duke. Thisinterchange of sex isaknown ex. pedientforthe provocatfonof mirth, andainthein.tance of MIr. Buckingham's burlesque Is less attended by verbal vulgarity than is commonly the case. The scenery and dresses are in excellent taste, and a higher tone is given to the work by the adoption of the music from Donizetti's opera. Miss Clara Morgan, one of the principal dancers at the Royal English Opera, has been engaged, and isthe principal fgure in an effective ballet that serves as an introduction to the pieace. Another new engat"ement is that of MIr. 2obinson, of Sadler's WeUs, who, with Miss Murray and Mir.

			UORRBSLE MiURDER AtT VENmIfi.-Another hor- rible marder has been commltted in this county. The peaceable town of Penrith was disturbed on Tuesday by the intelligence that a wounded man bad been found in a field at the end of Gilwilley-lane, by 31r. Rlchardson's servant. Thu man, who was a German, though much injured about the head, still breathed. Dr. Pearson was immediately sent for, but before he arrived the poor fellow had ceased to breathe. His body was conveyed to the Penrith Union Workhouse. It appears that the murdered man had been in Penrith for a day or two previous to his death, and that he had lod"ed at a common lodgin-house, kept by a person named �wales, above the Old Brewery. On the night pre- vious to his death he left Swales's hose, and took lodgings at another lodging-house at the Townhead, kept by a person named Honley. About 6 o'clock he went into the Grey Bull Inn, kept by Mr. Thomas Hyslop, where he had souse ale. After etaying some time there, he went out. He told Mr. Hyslop he was a gardener. He had also been in the shop of Mr. Dedlow, watchmaker, where he gave the samue account of himself, and said that he had left a wife anti three children in Neweastle-on-Tyne. He spoke Ger- man with ease. He returned to the Grey BnU in the even- ing, and had somo rum and ale mixed. A man named Tbemas Grey came in, andl they eat some timne together. When he left about ii o'clock he was a little the worse for drink. Ho told Mr. Hyslop that ho had with him a 51.-note and some gold, hut Mr. It-slop did not lee any money he bad, except about two shiUlngs in silver. When he went out he saki lie was geing to his lodgings to Swales's, but he went As if he was gers, to Iobertsbaw's He wvas last seen at tbe Townhead, between 11and 12 o'clock on Monday night, and was found at about S o'clock on Tues- day morning at the place above mentioned. Jt would seem that the Murderer had accnmp;nied his victim fromu the Townlbead across two fields, inl which cattle sleep on st,raw by night. It is probable they stayed for a while in this out-house, andl on Issuing forth early in the mowning, had gone about 50o yards in the di- rection of the Townhead, when, judging from some marks of blood on tlhe wall, A violent blow with some indstrumet hadl bee dealt out to the unfortinate man ; and a few yards further from the wAll the earth on the spot where the man's head had laid was saturated with blood. It appears lie had theni been dr.cged across to Panh
			corner, a distance of about five or sti yards. The stenes in the wall are marked with blood as are the loose stones around. One stone bad some hair upon it, as If it had beeu used over the head. The place where the poor man was found is one of the most lonely and unfrequenited by night. About 2s-. was found in his pocket. The police Immediately commnencedI a vigilant ssearch, and on Tuesday Afternoon Thomas Sowerby, alias Gray, an sueant in the employent hof Mr. Hetherington, of the Black Buall Tnn, Penritb, was arrested on suspicion of bedng concerned in the murder. He had been sent to Pat- terdale by his master with a load of straw earlY in the mowning. Mr. Superint-eodent Carson, on becoming ac. qusinted with circumstances which Aipeared to connect Sowerby with the offenceo, inimediately went off in pursuit, and succeeded in appreheudlag him in the! tap room at Mfr. Gelderd's hotel , at atterdabe. He Wus brought to Penrith, where ho remains in close custody. I

At Searle's a very spirit-ed race began with Mx. Playford's and Mr. Ireland's crews, till Mr. Potter steered right on to the former and put them ouLt of their course. Mr. Ireland's crew then began to take the second place, and led by balf their own length st Craven ; bat it was a desperate race between this party and Mr. Playford's to near the Crab-tree, where Mr. Ireland was just clear.

			Ta-E ACCiDENT IN SOUTWAR.-Some particu- lats have already been given of a very extraord:nary accident that took place one day last week at the Falcon dock, Southwark, when a man, named Thomas Belcher, who was about to unload a barge of bricks, was swept away with his horse and cart into the river in the pre- sence of a number of persons, who were unable, how- ever, to render any effectual assistance. Drags were, of course, procured almost immediately, but, in spite of the utmost exertions being made, no tidings or trace of either horse, cart, or man could be discovered. The river was carefully dragged during the whole week, both above and below bridge, but w,ithout any success, and it was thiought that the whole mass must have sunk into some deep ballast hole, of which there are a great number in the bed of the river between Blackfriars and Sonthwark bridges. The search continued, but without any effect, and it was the opinion of many persons accustomed to the river that the cart had been swept by the under-current of the tide to a considerable distance down the river, and that It was doubtful whetber it would ever be recovered. The master of Belcher, Mr. Chamberlayne, a carman, offered a reward for the discovery of the body, c., and on Sunday afternoon, while some men were engaged in dragging a considerable distance below London-bridge, the drags came in contact with souse heavy substance, which turned ont to be the missing cart and horse, the latter being still in the shafts,and aU the harness in its Sual place, and heappeared to have died almost without a struggle. It Is rather a curious circumstance that both the wheels were off the cart, and no trace of themn has since been discovered and it seems rather a difficult matter to account for this circumstance. The body of the unfortunate carter has not yet been found.
			POT-WxzroPrERs.-A "pot-waller," or "pot- wallopper," was one who had a right to boil a pot within the borouch, and if he had possessed this right for six months preceding an election, and had not been in the receipt of parovchial relief, hohad avote. Taunton waxs a pure pnot- walling borough, and one of the most corrupt in the king- domn. It is only very recently that the pot-wailers therei have been condunced that they are not entitled-as of right

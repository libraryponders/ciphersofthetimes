			I ST4TLSTIOS OF RRFBESBZV!1ATIONV.
			To THE EDITOR OF THE T=S.
			Slr,-Slnee my letter on tlls subject appeared In T7we 2'ineo Of Saturday last I hzve been asked to show the effeat of tho plan proposed therein orn the boroughs affeeted by the new Reform BilL
			The following table exhibits the dlalm to representation dedneed by adding together the population and the annual value of property, and dividing the product by 10,00 as the uit-
			BOEOuGoS Now RBT4NG Two BEsn;s wmc], WILL
			LOSF ON4 BY TEE NW RErFORM BILL.
			'1e tozoUwing gives the " claim" of the counties and boroughs to whioh it is proposed by the new .Reform Bill to give additional representatives:
			Taking this principlo as a guide, it appears that the new Reform BiU proposes to make the following alteration in the constituencies:-
			It takes away one of the two members now sent by 4 ooroughs whose representative claim or index number is 1; 13 whose number is 2; 6 whose number Is 3; and 2 whose number is 4. Total, 25 boroughs which lose 1 member each.
			It gives 2 members to 1 new borough wbose " claim" is 41: 1 whose claim is 14; and 2 whose claim is 12.
			It gives 2 additional members making 4 members, to 1 county whose claim Is 417.
			It gives 1 additlonal member, making 3 members each, to 2 counties whose claim Is from 72 to 99; 5 whose claim Is from 112 to 136 ; 4 whose cl&amp;im is from 15S to 189; and 1 (3onth Lancashire) whose claim is 330.
			In maldng these comparisons, it is desirzble to remember that of the 654 members in the House of Commons at this time the 253 county members represent an average popula- tlon of 71,000 each, and property of the annual value of 309,0001. each, showing a "representative claim" of 33 snob.
			The 401 borough members represent an average popula- tion of 23,000 each, and property of tho annual value of 123,0001., each, showing a " representative claim" of 14 each.
			The Reform Bill, so far as it goes, carries out with tole- rable exactitude, both in the reduction of the number of members and the appropriation of the new seats, the pri
			ciple of the " representative olaim." But it is difficult to find any reasonable ground or justification for limiting the application of the principle to so very small a range.
			Whie the new B3ll proposes to take one of the two members from 25 boroughs whose " claim" is from 1 to 4, It leaves still in the enjoyment of two members seven boroughs whose claim is only from 1 to 3, and two boroughs whose claim is only 4; and it omits to recognize the just right to a second member of Salford, whose claim is 42 (population, 85,000, and property 340,0001.).
			As it maybe satisfactory to Mr. BoviU and other mem. bers of the House of Commons to see the " claim" of the nine small boroughs now retmung two members each, be- fore referred to, and with whose prodigal proportion of Parliamentary power the Government have not ventured to propose any reduction, I append the list of those favoured constituencles:
			I veuturo to hope that your publication of these facts may tendto snmplify this complioated question, and that by the application of the same honest valuation of " represent- ative claims" In counties and boroughs, our legislators may arrive at the best means of enfranchising the people in pro- portion to their intelligence, and lay the foundation for an equitable adjustment of the representation.
			I am, Sir, your obedient servant.
			DAVID CHAD IWK.

			Timz TaRD C=lmA WAR.-Preparatione have com- menced at Hongkong and Shanghai in good earnest. The four vesels from Shanghai which are annoiuced as having sailed under sealed orders comprise Her Majesty's ship6 Sampson, Acteon, Dove, and gunboat AIgerine ;two of these vessels are well-known surveying vessels, and it is given on good authority that this small expedition is in- tended to reconnoitre In the Gulf of Pecheli and the mouth of the Peiho. and to take possession of some convenient slip of land which wll be serviceable to our troops. A statement is also crrent that they were despatched to can- ture isome trading junmks which had left Shanghai for tfio Poeiho, and supposed to he loaded with arms and ammuni- tion. Itis also stated that the Chinese Government are cast- Ing heavy guns, and using large quantities of American an- thracite coal for this purpose. Guns of the largest calibre have also boon imported from the United States. Her Majesty's ship Imperieuse, 51 guns, bearing the lag of Rear- Admiral Jones, O.B. second in command, left Hongkong for Shanghai on the E2d of February; she took up six boats, each capable of landing 100 men, a large number of tents, and a brldge or pier, which oould he made available for lauding troops over tho mud. She also had on board field- c arriages for mounting her 32-pounders, and a large quan- tity of ammunition and war stores. The British and French unaval commanders are engaged at Hongkong in chartering vessels and steamers, orgOanizing a Chinese coolie corps, and o3ther necessary measures. General Montauban, the French military Commander-in-Chief, had also arrived fromFrance and tho Quartermaster-General of the Britlsh Army. From these active operations it may be augured that it is intended to push the expedition north durlng tho present mouth, in perfect readiness for the deCision of Lord Elgin anrde
			hs French coleague, Baron Gres. The delay in thelr departure will consequently be a sotrce of great dis- appointment end anxiety. Nothing of a reinable natur
			haslbeen heard of the action or intentons of the Corrt of- Pekin, nor of omr Ambassador, Mr. Bruce, Ia ns rumonred that the Takn forts have been dismantled in order to strengthen those at Tien-tsin. There have been no further einforcements from India. The detachment of the 44th Qoueens Regiment, which was annonced In oua r d ast as havolg arrived at Singapore, has left that place for Hong kong, in Her Majesty's shlp Pearl, and transport Cressy. A portion of the 99th Rtegiment had arrived at Singapore from Calcutta in the Octavia, towed by the Reynard. The Samoom, with the tree s as originally embarked at Ports- mouthhaudalso any v, and proceeded on to Hongkong with the transports Mars, Octavia, and Jessaroine.

			STATE OP TBADB.
			EIRmMINO AI AFRIL 14-Tho trade of this town continues quiet. Within the last two or three days a few orders have been distributed ont account of the home trade, and in fancy goods there is more business doing than there has been of late. The shipping orders generally are small The merchants have given out very few for the last fort- night, and the advance in the rate of discount wvll havo an unfavourable effect upon that branch of trade here. The workpeople have made two or three days holyday this we ",- for the last threo days they have been working fn' tnom; but manufacturers' order-books arein the majority of instances so closely worked np that unless business ralles speedily the men will of necessity be upon short time. 'Up to this moment the pinch has only been slightly and partially felt. Tho advance of one farthing per lb. in the price of copper was altogether nnexpected,and wil havea prejudicial effectupon some branches. The closing meeting of the ironmasters of this district for the cmurent quarter was held at Dudley this afternoon, but the attend- ance was small and little buslness done in finished iron. Plrices of best brands do not appear, however, to have undergone any depreciation. The most favourable circnu- stance to be noticed In connexion with the series of trade meetings jest concluded has been the punctuality with which the quarter-day accounts have been paid all over the district, a fact which shows pretty conclusively that so far this year the large amount of trado done has been a legiti- mate one.
			BRAtDFORD, l4m,-Onr wool market has presented no neow feature during the pest week. Buyers still evince on unwillingness to operate to any extent, yet staplers adhere to the extreme current rates. The prospective accounts of the quality and quantity of the next clip ore not cheering. At the York weal market on the 12th inst. there were only a few fieoes shown, and consequently but little business
			mas done. Super hogs reached 23s. per stone. Nolls and shorts continue in good demand, and the tendency of prices is, if anything, rather against the purchaser. There is still going on a eteady and regular absorption of worsted yarns for the home trade, and, though not many fresh trans- actions have taken place since the date of our last report, spinners keep well engaged upon previous con- tracts. Purchasers of yarns for export are doing very little, there being a lassitude in commercial enterprise on the continent. Tho prices of worsted yarns are much the same as last week. In cotton yarns only a trifling amount of basiness has been done. The present period being be- tween the seasons manufacturers are working up their stooks, and decline to give further orders for these yarns until they themselves obtain new orders for goods. Rates, nevertheless remain eteady, except in thercase of singl
			yarns suitable for Coburgs, which yarns may be bought en somewhat easier terms.q The transactions in pieces have been only on a limited scale, and mainly for the purpose of perfecting aseortments. Stocks centinue light, and prices pretty firm . The return of ungenial weather is detrimental to the business of the home merchants by feausing spring goods to move off less quickily than they otherwise would do. Arrangements are beginning to be made for supplies of gvoods for the next winter, and fancies are much anquired for. Considerable orders for Wiassys are stated to have been already placed. Our trade generally has been quieter on account of the Easter, holydays than it prohably would have been had the week been an ordinary one.
			HALIFAX, 14Tss.-This has been a rather quiet week in the worsted trade. There has been only a small attendance of buyers, and orders are rather limited jUEst now. Spinnera and manufacturers, however, are mostly ii fuU work, and stocks are In a moderate compass. Yarns and wools are steady in price, yet the demand is not actually brisk. The heavy goods' trade Is dull, the chief demand being foz fancy productions. The carpet trade, take it in all its depart- ments, Is in fair condition, as Is also the woollen trade.
			IIUDDEESFIELD, 14TiL-The woollen and other manufacturers of this district are steadily employed, may of them being engaged in orders for both summer and autumn goods, but the trade both at the warehouses and in the public mnarket has been flat this week, The latter fact is, doubtless, in some degree attributabl to the occurrence of the Easter holydays. Fancy trouserings and black doe- bkina are in fa3ir seasonable demand, as are also Bedford and woollen cords, Wool continues very steady in price, and the local brokers are do'lng a fair businesis.
			LEEDS, 14TH.-There has been a moderate attendance of buyers in the cloth-haUs to-day; but purchases were made in only snall quantities, and the market uponthe whole was of a quiet character. At present there is a little lul Ln the demand generaly for the woollen manufactures of this dis- trlet. The rate of production, however, is going on nndi- minished, some few manufacturers being so busy as to keep their machinery running overtime. Stoeks on hand are not large, hat they are gradually accumulatirg. Doubtless, however, the woollen trade of the town and district is in a sound state, and the general opinion is that the falling off in the demand is of only a temporary character. Wools are steady in price and demand, and are without change since last week. The flax trade cautintes active, and prices are well maintained.
			LEICESTER, 14T-s-Thore has not been much doine in the hosiery trade this week, the annual Easter holydays having interrupted buslness. The market, however, con- tinues healthy, and trade is only retarded by the unsea- sonable weather. In the country districts the hosiery trade iS in a satisfactory condition, and the workpeople are for the most part well engaged. I~n yea-as there is no change in price. The wool-market continues firm, and there is no appearance of any diminutioni in price,
			MAiNCHESTER, 14Tsr.-The market closes very flat. The rise of discountg to 5 per cent. has not affected prices, because usay descriptions of goods are still well engaged and the supply Is scarces, but it hns had the effect of induc- ing extra caution, and thus restricting the amount of busi- noes. The India letters had tho effect of causing extra
			buieson Tuesday for that maarket, but the imputlse thus gientobsiness has nealy died away, and we have at the cls ofth week, a very dull and inanimate market. For ynsteeis a decline of j.d. par lb., or rather more hasbee experlued by buyers in numbers and qualities (or -which spinners are coming out of orders, and for cloths in similar circumstances manufecturers have been willng to take li~d. par piece less; but these are chiefly exceptional cases.

			NEWCASTLE-ON.TYNE, 14Trr-Trade has been much brisker this week in the Northern counties, and there have been large exports of coals and other materials oversea and coastwise since this day week. The followving are some of the quotations of coal freights for the spring tradei on our quayside :-Adeu, 561. ; Bombay, 4_51.; Calcutta, 471. ; Cey- lon, 481. ; Hongkong, 601. ; Singapore, 431.; New York (coals), 191. ; New York' (goods), 221.; Alexandria, 251.; Algiers, 22(. ; Carthagena (coals or coke), 15f.- Constanti- nople 201; Treste,241.

			oversea coa trade of the kinLgdom last mnhws182 In March, 1859, there were 1,83 empoe. O h total this year 1,068 were British, 27Fec,8 Danish, 110 Swedish endl Norwegian, 8Aein,3 Austrian, and 31 Prussian. A meeting of h auatrr
			of fire-bricks, fire-clay retorts, andl other articles of the fire- cloy has been held In the Ohambher of Commerce here this week-, to consider the queries that had, been sent to them by the Chamaber of Commerce in reference to the duties pro- posed to be levled under the French treaty upon articles of their manufacture. We alluded last week to the effect the treaty was likely to have upon the fire- brick, and earthenware trade of the district. The meetin considered that the following ought to be the
			dte-vis., on fire-bricks not exceedin a franc perl,00; on fire-clay retorts not more than half -a.-?ranc per lnealfoot; on sanitary pipes, 2.1 per cent, ad valorem ; and on fire-cloy half-a-franc per ton ; and that higher duties than those would serio ey Injure the trade, and on some articles would be almost prohibitory. Mr. Joseph Cowen, the chairman of the River Tyne Carmmissioners, andl Mr. Addison Potter were appointed to represent the trade in Plaris during the negotiatiens. At aspecial meeting of theChamber of Com- merce held here yesterday Mr. George Ridfley, MI.P., in the chair, it was resolvedl that Mfr. Allhsusen, chymical manu- facturer, and Mrx. Cowen he requested to consider them- selves as representatives of the Chamnber either In Londonx or Plaris, inx any negotiations which may take place in refer- once to Use treaty. Considerable dIscussion tool, place as to' the probable effect of the Chancellor of the Exrchequer's
			reslutin with respect to bills of lading on outward ship- ments;~ and It was the general opinion that unless the duty of lz. Gd. were modifie it would oporate most injurlemsly on exports of packages of smal value,.It was als cton- sidered that if the stamp duty of 5s. on charterparties were reduiced to 6d., or even to 3d., a considerable revenue would be raised; whereas at present the high duty Is seldom paid even on foreign voyages, and almost never on coasting ones. Mx. Ridley promised his attention to this.
			NOTTIN'GHAMI, l4rTc.-There has been less dloing this week In the lace trade, partly through the Easter holydays Interfering with the regular routine of business, and partly from the conLtinuance of cold weather, which pents manufacturers finishing that descriptionof goods wMnch ar
			uulyslale at this period of the year. There is a toler- abeMuins doing in plain and ",whip " Mechlias, hut foundation nets are in less requaest. The cotton fancy ~trade Is extremaely quiet. In the silk lace departmenLt there is no- thnnt oeotAeilno h ueii orefsga ture from the town, praying HerMajestytoextend herpstron- ago to the lace trade, stating that " many millions of pounds have been expended for the carrying on of the lace trade, in which in thisi locality, nearly 40,000 persons, chiefly females, are employed, and that, as the demand for the products of the manufacturers is especially influenced by fashion, and as since the summer of 1859 the use of Lleac by the upper clasess has gradually decreased, the result has been thaLt an unPrecedented number of failures have occurred, and the

			WOLVE1B}HAIPTON, 14rw-The resaUlt of the qnLG terly mestings of the members of the iron trade of this dis. '.ict fully confirms the previous statements of its quietn,,, and dullness which have for some weeks past appeared i3 this notice. At none of tho quarerly meetings of the trade slnca the eventfel period of the crisis two years ago ha- there been more decided duIlness There awe a few- probably hardly half-a-dozen-makers who are able to keep their works in fair operatlon; but the great majority am not inreceipt of orders snficientto keep tbeirmills and forges in anything like complete activity. The United State&amp;2 demand is very dull, and no branch of the export trade is at all active. Prices are undoubtedly weaker for mnufasc. tured iron, and the trade quotations find an interpretation favourable to buyers. In the local transactions for minerals and pig-iron little is doing, and a reduction in the price of pig-iron is now acknowledged by almost al partes in the trade. The low price at which pig-iron. is bought makes it a question whether its productio2u is profitable-a question on which confidence in the faithful discharge of monetary engagements hinges. I,t is, however, quite possible that the present dullness mayappear greaterthan itreally is, on account of the general expectation at the beginning of the year that a de. cided improvement woul'd be experienced by this time, and purchases were made with this impremsion, which bas in no degree been fulfilled. There is always a disp,sition on the part of those engaged in the iron trade to exaggerate any ground of hopeful anticipation, and probably the present dunlness Is In some degree the resalt ot a reaction from toc sanguino hopes. No one appea tolookfor much tmmex diate benefit from the new commnercia' treaty with France, In the local hardware trades there is a steady demand, althouigh in these branches also there is rather less activity, than in the early part of the year.

			TRADE OF TE PORT OF �SrWICE-I appear from official returs made up for the year ending March 31 that the trade of the port of Ipswich, which has for some time been In a depremsed state, continues to decline. Onl
			116 vessels entered inwards from foreign parts In the Inst2 months against 132 in the preceding year, and the en- trances coastwlse also feU off from 1,266 to 1,208. The clearances outwards declined from 709 to 094, and the Customs' duties received feU off from 25,7491. to 23,29 O, Of the latter decrease 4001. Is attributed to the reduction of duties recently carried into effect under the Bud-et of Mr. Gladstone. The local shipping interest suffers, no N'ubt, from the pressure of railway competition.

			MO2YA;dFJ BTE1and O1ITY?BBLILjGgyw.
			SATUnRDAY EVzssxo,.
			The English funds opened this morning at a re- action of an eighth, but subsequently became very fia. The first bargains in Consols for money were at 940 to i. An advance then occurred to 94i to -, and the final prices were 941 for money, and 94t- for the 9th of May. Bank Stock closed at 224 to 226; Reduced and New Three per Cents., 93 to i; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Five per Cents., lOS;j Rupee Five per Cents., 98, Five-and-a-lalf per Uents., 103k; India Bonds, Gs. discount to par-~ and Exchequer-bills, 6s. to 9s. premium.
			Tae demand for money to-day has been less active, but for long-dated bills high terms are stil demanded. In the Stock-Exchange the supply was abundant.
			There ha3 been rather more business in foreign stocks than is sual on a Saturday, and in some case3 a slight improvement has taken place. Turkish Six per Cents. were firm at 76 to 2 old, at 613 to i new. There were no transactions in Brazilian Scrip, and the price remains - discount. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 100 ; Four-and-a-..alf per Cents., 90X; Chilian Six per Cents., 102k; Por- tugueze, 43, 42i and i; for the account 42i; RusAian Four.and-&gt;aIalf per Cents., 97 ~ Three per CJents., 65; Spanish, for the accounlt, 46E'and i ,De- ferred, 35 ; Turkish Six per Cents., 76 and A; New Loan, 61k; and Venezuela Three per Cents., 26g.
			The last quotation from Paris this evening was 70f 9.oc., showring a fraction21 advance.
			- o goiU was tauen trom the Bank to-day.
			The aUegation current yesterday regarding the discount houses seems to have been confirmed. A correspondent observes " The report is of a cha- racter so extremely siUly that every one is wondering how it could find its way into the columns of The Times." Nevertheless, there is now no doubt as to ita correctness. That credence should have been refused to it is natural, because anything more ridi- culous or more censurable could hardly be found in commercialrecords. The firms in question feel aggrieved that the Bank of England-an establish- ment in the same way of business with themselves, znly on a very superior scale-will not supply them with means whenever they have gone beyond the;r own resources. The matter being precisely as if a butcher with inadequate capital were to undertake contracts for provisioning the army, and on finding himself unable to complete them should insist that the regular contractors, with whom in his vanity he had attempted to compete, should then accept his liabilities and allow him a profit for the privilege. lWhatever might be thought of such a claim, it was open to them to urge it by all recognized modes. They could appeal to the law courts if they con- eidered they had legal rights, or to public opinion if they rested their case solely cn its moral merits. All parties were ready for the discussion, and a judg- ment could soon have been arrived at, because, apart from the question whether bankers are to be allowed the freedom conceded to all other traders, or are to be compeled against their judgment to dis- count for customers whom they would rather avoid, ashort recapitulation of the events of 1857 and especaDy of the Circumstances connected with the suspension of the Bank Charter Act,as well as of the revelations in the subsequent winding up of faled houses, would rapidly have enabled the public to decide whether the title of the existing piscount establishments to favour is so strong and excep- tIonal that it should be allowed to override every ordinary commercial principle. But it appears that bo appeal either to law or reason-the onlv course ually considered open in England-w-aa not deemed desirable. For some time past, whenever, from political or other causes, there has been any little inconvenience in the money-market, such as the majority of reapectable men would endeavour by all legitimate means to smooth or mitigate, a certain set have occupied themselves in pretending
			'hat some dreadful pressure was coming on, and that all that was taking place, and all that was to be dreaded, could be traced to the determination of s.he Bank to discount for the public instead of for t,he bil brokers. These matters, however, although t.hey have repeatedly led to temporary per- plexity, have been too small to be worthy of much notice. It became necessary to at- tempt something on a grander scale, and the re- iults of the effort were yesterday brought to pub- lic cognizance. The discount houses, by realizations In one form or another, are affirmed to have scraped together a certain amount of bank-notes-some people say 2,000,0001. or 3,000,0001.-and to have ,ocked them up. This is usualy thought to be about the worst use to which bank-notes can be put, but they had an object, and that object must have been to produce inconvenience either to the Bank or the commercial community, or both, or the more aniable one of giving a turn to other capitalists by temporarily wvithdrawing from competition from them, and enabling them, for a little while at least, to get 5 per cant., or perhaps more. Which is the true Interpretation ? The first harmonizes with previous demonstrations, but is morally disagreeable; the uecond has a philanthropic character, but is not flat- tering as regards financial sagacity. Perhaps, sup- poing a design to produce embarrassment to be admitted, it wil be urged that the end was bene- ficent, since it was to enable the discount houses to resume a sway they may consider essential to the mercantile stability of Great Britain. But there is 31o greater evil in commerce than the liability to sudden and needless disturbances ; and are we to hold that the end justifies the means, and that we may do evil that good may come? The eople fwho have been frightened, and who have fad to pay 5 per cent., instead of 3, will hardly for tho moment appreciato that plea. Dloreover, the opinions and customs of society are against such proceedings, and where they have as- sumned an extreme form, they have even come under judicial reprobation. About two years back there was a case in New York State of a man who col-
			lected a great number of notes of a particular bank with the view of presenting them all at once, so as to bring the concern into difficulty. He had been assisted by others, and had incautiously mentioned that fact. The directors thereupon prosecuted him for conspiracy, and he was found guilty and sen- tenced. This shows the sensitiveness of public feel- Ing on such points, and, without assuming that in the present case there has been any combination or any purpose of specific injury, the warning may be accepted that it is dangerous to beHin a contest with establishments of public credit with any weapons other than those of law and argument. It is to be cknomwledged that any individual firm has a rihet to exercise supreme command over its own propertyI even though others maybe ruined by sudden caprices in connexion with it, and it must be inferred that In what has just been witnessed there has been no
			s-eprehensiblo concert. If MIessrs. A or B, for in-!
			tiance, like at any time to leek ulp a million or tvvoi of notes, wshen notes are vvorth o per cent., or even to burn them, no one, unless it be a relative, can have a right to interiere. All that can be hoped is that the next individual honse that may feel dis- posed to measure its resources against those of the Biank of England will bide its timue, and lay its plans o as to do the wrork effectually. The world at the present juncture cannot afford to be constantly excited by fear from some inscrutable operations, only to find at last that there is no mischief any- where, and that nothing has taken place beyond the fact of an eminent discount firm having placed its notes to fructify in its iron safe. It is true that the moment when the comminity were likely to be in- convenienced by an unprecedented pressure from 'he quarterly revenue payments, was not altogether
			Inopportune for commencing the struggle, but the' EFilure has been not the less complete, and it is evident that the final effort must be deferred until the occurrence of actual war, or sorae other calamity when the Government and the country, rather than see the Bank of England and every com- mercial interest crushed, may, perhaps, insist that each discount house shall be first served upon its own terms, and that the regular bankers and the public shall tben come in at the market rate.
			The Board of Inland Revenue have given the fol- lolainq explanations fin answer to some in(quiries refeniln" to the operation of the new Stamp Act:-
			" A bifi drawn a road remitkWd to this coentry is not liable to any stamp duty until it is negotiated within the kingdom or presented for payment.
			" If a bilU has bCen negotiated it has become liable to the duty which was payable at the time when it was first nego- tiated, and being at that time duly stamped it can become chargeable with no other duty either upon any further nego- tiation, or upon being presented for payment.
			"Bat where a bill which arrived in the kingdom before the recent Act Is retained without being negotiated, and therefore without being subject to any immedlate chargo of duty until after the passing of the Act 23 Victoria, chap. 15, it mnlt, upoJn the first negotiation of It, or if it be not nego- ulated upon beinz presented for psyment be stamped with the daty Elmp_ed by that Act."
			The bar silver brought by the Parana has been disposed of at 61id. per ounce, showing a decline of id. from the rate obtained for that by the steamer
			of the middle of last month. Silver has been de- clining for more than a fortnight, and last week large amounts were sold for shipment to Bombay
			Annexed is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week. 1-The shareholders of the Dundalk and Enniskillen have confirmed the provisional agree- ment for the lease of the Londonderry and Ennis- killen. The report of the Peebles states that the net revenue for the half-year ending in February was 2,9031., being an increase over the correspond- ing period of the previous year of 5561. The pro- posed dividend is at the rate of 4i per cent. per annum, leaving 531. to be added to the reserve, which will then amount to 1,1641. An amalgamation with the North British on tho basis of a 4A per cent. divi- dend is recommended. At the Jedlurgh meeting a dividend of 3 per cent. was agreed to. The report of the Fife and Kinross states that the revenue for tshe past half-year was about the same as in the cor- responding sih; months, but that since the period for which the accounts have been made up there has bean * considera'ole increase. By the opening of additional faCilities a fuller development of the revenue is anticipated. Wharnclie meetin Of the Metropolitan and Monkland lineshave been held to approve Bills now before Parliament. The smpplemental report of the New Brunswick and Canada states that, the English contractors having failed to fulfil the terms accepted by the company, an arrangement has been concluded with Canadian
			wauraceors tor ttie completion of the railway and for the issue of debentures to meet liabilities. The particulars of the new contract are set fortn in detail. The directors of the Great Southern of India announce that the works have been actively prosecuted, and that the first section from Nega- patam to Trichinopoly will probably be opened in the spring of next year. Permanent way ma- terials for 50 miles have been sent out, besides a considerable portion of the rolling-stock. The traffic Is expected to bo fully equal to the original calcula- tion. The accounts of the Grand Trunk of Canada for the past year show that 11,242,3681. had been re- ceived on capital account, and 11,462,8461. ex- pended, leaving a balance against the company of 220,4781. The excess of revenue over working expenses was 52,4901. The report of the Buffalo ard Lake Huron states that that the receipts in the half-year ending in January were 35,8361., and the expenditure 29,7551., leaving a balance of 6,0811. The necessary works to con- nect the railway with Goderich, and to im- prove the harbour are about to be let. The direc- tors regret that a reciprocity of business with the Western lines on the completion of the Grand Trunk system to Detroit has not been obtained. The Bahia and San Francisco report announces that ,he first section is so far completed as to enaale the opening of the line before the end of June. The works on the second section are proceeding as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the loss of several of the best mechanics through the severity of the wet season. The relations of the company with the Imperial and Provincial Governments continue satisfactory. At the Pernambuco meeting it was stated that the works are being carried on with vigour by the company's engineer. The traffic continues to improve, the receipts in the half-year ending the 31st of January being 8,5481., against 7,1911. in the corresponding period of 18a8-9. A tender has been
			ccepted to finish the second section of the line now' pproaching completion, and to construct the third and fourth sections. The capital account shows that 813,0961. has been received, and 748,9181. ex- pended, leaving a balance of 64.1781.
			The annual meeting of the Agra and United Ser- vice Bank was held to- day, Major McGregor in the chair, when the report announcing a dividend and bonus for the past year at the rate of 12 per cent. was adopted. Annexed is an abstract*-
			"The directors have much pleasure In laying before the proprietors the usual accounts for the 12 months ended the
			st of December last. After writing off any balances which were deemed irrecoverable, and making adequate provision for doubtful accounts, the directors have been enabled, from the profits of this period, to declare, free of income-tax, two half-yearly dividends at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum each, and to add to the last a bonus of 1t. per share, thus making the rettrn equivalent to 12 per cent. par annum. There remaining an available balance of SO,S021., the directors have placed 15,0001. thereof to credit of the reserve fund, thus increasing that fend to 190,0001., and have carried forward 12,3021. to credit of the present year. With the further sum of 3,0001. they have, with reference to clause 55 of the deed of settlement, opened a superannuation fend account, considering that provision for this eventual liability should be gradualy made by moderate appropriations from the yearly profits."
			The annexed information respecting the mining business of tho week is condensed from the Mining Journacl
			"The mining share-mark-et this weel. has leen dull and heavy, except for a few divldend mines that have been sought after for investment, and, consequently, have ad- vanced in price. With very few exceptions, progressive mines have been more thanusuaUy neglected, and have mostly receded. At Dolcoath Mine meeting the accounts showed a
			credit balance of 4,4041. ; a dividend of 3,5801. (101. per i share) was declared, and 8241. carried to the credit of next account. At the Wicldow Copper Mine meeting the accounts showed a net profit for the half-year ending March, of 13,4971. ; of that sum, 21 per cent. (3371.) was addedtotheindemnityfund against bad debts, and a dividend of 21. 5s. per share was declared, free of incomne-hax, leaving 1,9101. to be added to the surplus fund. At Wendron Consols Mine meeting the account showed a credit balance of 1,3871.; a dividend of 5121. (1)s. per sharel was declared, and a balance of 8751. carried to tho credit of the next account. At the Wheal Kitty (St. Agnes) meet- ing, the accounts showed a credit balance of 8151. ; a divi- dend of 5001. (2s. per share) was declared, and a balance of 3151. carried to the credit of the next account. At Moland Mine meeting the accounts showed a credit balance of 1931.; an estimated account of assets and liabilities showed a balanca of the former of 1SI.; a caU of is. per share was made. At South Wheal Seton meeting the accounts showed a debit balance of 5691. a call of 31. persharewas made. At Wheal Damisel meeting the accounts showed a debit balance of 3741. ; a call of 21. per share was made."

			RATL WAY TNTELLIGENUC.
			I&gt;,E.T,FRtE.
			The half-yearly meeting was held a' Peeble on Saturday, wrhen the report, an abstract of which has appeared in Thi aimes, recommending a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the preference shares, and 4A per cent. per annum on the ordinary chares, was adopted, with the ex- ception of that part of It which related to the question of amalgamation with the North BritIsh Railway company.
			The Wharnclif a meeting was then held to consider the BiU authorizing the proposed amalgamation.
			Sir G. G. MorooTGO y the chairman, stated that the North British Company had since the last meeting in- creased their offer to 4 per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares, and had subsequently made a further offer of 4; per cent. per annum, and they had agreed to pay the Parlia- mentary expenses of the amalgamation. He adverted to the probabUity of the company being injured by the pro- posed raUways to Symington and Innerleithen, and con- tended that under the amalgamation with the North British they would be in a better position than as au independent
			company.
			Mr. AaBUMOT opposd tho amnalgamation, and Itraed that the earnings of the Peebles line in the hat yea had ex- ceeded e per cent., with the prospact of increase. He contended that the proposal of the North British was still Inadequate, and that the seenrity was not eatisfactory.
			After some discussion a vote was taken, 'whenuvotes and proxies representing 47,1201. of capital In the company were recorded for tho motion, and 26,230l. against it. The mo- tion approving the Amalgamation BiUl was therefore lost, in consequence of three-fourths of the capital of the com- pany represented at the meeting not having voted in its favour.

			ROYAL SWEDISH.
			T1he report of tho English directors of this comnany states that the directors had, through their chairmsn in Sweden, again brought prominently before the King and the Government the claims of the company, as set forth in the memorial, pressing upon thcm the great importance to the country at large of granting the company some assistauco, either in the shapo of guarantee originally con- templated, or by pnrchasin- the property on the terms stipulated in the ohsrler. Althoush His Maleaty exxreased himself favourably inclined towards the dompany-S 1!e- posal, he was unable to give any assurance that it would be consldered equally urgent by the Diet, to whom the matter, as wel as all other questions relating to rdalways, would ultimatey have to be submitted, and wlth whom the decision would entirely rest. The direstors recast. X s6a6iat they see no immediate prospeot of their petition being complied with. Owing to the small surplus revenue atitso ommand, the Doet was reluctant to impose fresh taxes for the purohase of the line at present, but they hid determined during tho session to complete the leading State trunk lines, and espeeially the link of about 40 mniles between Catherlneholm, south of the Malar lake end HTiulo, se as to perfect the whole Government railway be- tween Stockholm and Gottenburg. The Diet had, however, in addition, granted powers to the Government to construct a branch line extending for about 1o English miles from the State line at Elalsberg to Orebro, where it would join that of this company. This junotion when made would bring the company's line in direct communication with the Govern- ment trunk line from Stockholm to Go%enburg, and conse- quently enhanco the value of theproperfreryconsiderably. The construction would, in all probability, occupy some two or three years, the directors Saw no alternative but to con- tinue to work the line as economically as possible, feeling satisfied that the time would come when the necessity of purchasing It would become apparent to the Government, so that the entire railway system of the country might be placed under one control. The directors bad the pleasure to state that beyond the overdue interest to the bond and share holders, tho company was entirely ree from debt, as well as from litigation of every Idnd. The net result of the traffic for the past year only showed a profit of about 1,100. The completion of the line between Arboga and Eoping, a distance of nine miles, had occupied the serious attention of the board, who were still convinced of the great advantages to be derived from finishing thoso works, especially as up- wards of 20,0001. had already been spent on them ; but from the position of the company, and the difficulties that stood In the way of raising the additional funds required- viz., 15,001. or 20,0001.-the board had been un- able as yet to take any atlve steps towards the accomplishment of this most desirable object. The working of the line had been carried on throughout tho year with regularity; the permanent way, until the recent severe weather, had been kept in good condition, and the roUling stock, though inadequate in engine Power to the ro- qulrements of the winter traffic, had also been well main- tained. The directors were anticipating the early re- turn of the 3,9441., remaining as the balance of the original caution-money in the hands of the Swedish Government, which they intend to appropriate either In erecting goods de. pats and other works found necessary by the dovelopment of the traffic on the line already opened, or, If the remaining sum could be raised, on the completion of the line between Arboga end Eoping. The directors remained without the mneans of making any payment on ccconnt of the interest due to the obligatlon and preference shareholders, or, indeed, to sugeest any equitrable plan by wihich those arrears couId he lquidated, and they have no alternative, therefore, but to ask the further forbearance of both. The traffic for the year 1859 amoanted to about 10,5001., and the expenses to 9,3451., leaving a balance of 1,155L It was expected that some considerable saNing might be effeoted by consolidating various offices and reduclig the expenses in every possible Wav.

			A FmAstru ScnEx.-On Friday afternoon, when a vast concourse of persons was assembled on the racecourse at Abergavenny, an accident oocurred which created a most painful interest. The Grand Stand is close to the bank of the river Usk, the waters of which were at this time swollen and rapid from the recent storms. At Abergavenny is ajoint counties pauper lunatic asylum, in which are about 800 patients, and on this afternoon a large number of the female lunatics were brought out to walk by the side of the river ouposite to the racecourse, and from which they would see something of the sport going on on the other side. Suddenly ono of the patients-a fine middle-aged woman-saw among the crowd on the opposito bank her husband, who Is a confectioner at Nlewport, and was hawk- ing his wares among the people. With a wild scream she ran down the bank and precipitated heraelf into the foaming torrent, and attention was drawn to her just as the horses were about to start for the Club Stakes. A scene of terror ensued such as cannot be described. The lunatics on the bank clung to each other and filed the air with their shrieks. The poor woman was carried rapidly down the stream, and battled wildly with its rapid witers, yelling for ald when her head came above water. The assembled crowd deserted the racing to rush to the river's bank, and shouted with dismay and excitement as each plunge seemed to be the last the victim would give. A man throw off his overolothing and dashed straight towards her amid tre- mendous cheers; but when ho reached the middle of the stream the strength of the current bore him away for some distance. In vain he turned and tried to ascend; he, too, became visibly exbausted, and It nowr seemed imminent that two human beings must perish untimely in the sight of a frantic crowd,who were utterly powerless to save them. The man, however, managed to gain the aide and held onto some overhanging bushe, while the body of the woman, who had ceased etruggling, and was now supposed to be dead, floated towards him. At this jnnct5re she sank, and the man, vwith a last effort, dived after her. The brief space when they were submerged appeared an age; but the brave fellowhad grasped the drowning woman's hair, and pulled her in towards the shore. The bank was steep; but they were both got out more dead than alive. A ringing cheer, such as one seldom hears, broke from the spectators on the Grand Stand on tho opposite bank, and most of them, with true English imperturbability, re- turned to the spot in time to witness the finlshof the race, in which, singular enounh, five out of the six horses and riders had met with accidents more or less severe. The usual restoratives were applied to tba persons thus almost miraculously savei from death, and they Loth recovered in a short time. A coUection wss made for the heroic fellow, and was most liberaUy resDondaed to. Nearly lo-, was con. trlbuted by those on the Grand Stand, and Lord Trodegar, who was acting as judge, undertook to levy contributions from his party and the gentry in carriages, making over 204 In alL

			Tnx Bu:RAnoN CoLLEY ExPLosioN.-..Tho coroner's inquest on the bodlea of the 76 men nnd lads kilUed in Bnrradon Colliery, Northumberland, on the 2d of Marcb, waS resumed on Wednesday, and was continued over Thursday and Friday and then adjourned untiE Wednesday next. Mr. E Dnnn, the Government inspeotor for Northumberland; Mr. Atkinson, the Go- vernment inspector for Durham; Mr. Mlorgan, nnder viewer at Pelten, Mr. G1. EUiott, the head viewer of Lady Londonderry's coiheies in the north, and several pit offi- cialshaveboon examined during the aittin8s. Mr. Elliott in his evidence, gavo the result of his observationsc in the mine after the explosion, which he carefully- examined in the company of Mr. Foster and other eminent viewers. The conclusion that he had CDme to from a close observation of the pit was that the cause of the two exploslons and loss of life was a fall of stone in the north return, which had prevented the foul air from passing down the return to the furnace and out of the pit, and thus throwing the gas generated In the plt back up a board where a pitman named Maddox was workdng, and which fired at his naked candle. Mlr. Morgan, an old-fashioned pitman of 50 years' experience, and the first person who ever used the Davy lamp, gave it us his opinion thatthe ventilation of tha pit was weaks and sluggish; in fact, that there was too much gas-the goaven or broken acting as reservoirs-
			and too little air in the mlne. Mr. Dunn and MIr. Atkinson gave lengthened reports of measurements and experiments made in the pit after the explosion. 3Ir. Dann could not bring himself to doubt that the evidence of Es
			many of the coal workmen was correct as to the dangerous state of the air in the mine before the explosion, and he was clearly of opinion that the explosion had orlpinated in the viclnity of Maddox's-board, In consequence of the vealknes and instability of the air, end the joint ac cumulatIon of gas from the goaves and also from the whole coal workings especially in case of the door in the far broken being neg- lected. Riaving expressed au opinion astoethelImmediate origin of the explosion-viz., the weskness end instability of the air c hent, end the exstence of foul geaves In a position the natural outlet of wshich was towardls the naked lights of the workxmen, he felt imperatively called upon to specify what, in his oplnion, had occasioned the weakness end istability of the air current. They were :-1, imperfect areas of upeast-shaft and principal sir courses; 2, altitude of workings above the shaft level; 3, numerous splits and subdivisions to meet the difficult positions con- sequenb upon the worklng of pillars in questionable localities; 4, numerous doors, brattices, end regu- lating stoppings; 5, inattention to air couses in the waste; 6, want of a dumb drift; 7, objection to pumps in upeast-shaft; 8, impolicy of working south side pllars in the midst of ventilation; 9, objection to coal working going on in return air from foul goaves; 10, neglect of the use of safety lamps when the air was weakand loaded; 11 smallness of intake main, zolleyway, arches, 6c.
			Dk Ainson, after 8lvingavery full detail of the general ventslatson of the mine, and the tests that he and Mr. Dunn and other gentlemen applied to it waS of opinion that the explosionhad arisen from leaving open adoor, knownas Thlrlvwellrs door, which, by keeplng open for half-an-hour, he, Mr.Atkinson,said other gentlemen withhlm, brought gasm into the workings where naaked lights had been used atthetimeof the explosion. He imputed the explevon more to thi door than to any other cause he had been able to conceive, including any inadequacy in the quantities of the air. The danger would be increased by no trapper ld being placed at that door. He did not agree with the theory that a falU of stone in the return had beon the sole canEs of the exploslon. The subscrlptlon on behalf of the families of the sufferers has reached the handsome sum Of 5,1191U 19s, 8hd,

			LONDON, MONDAY, APRL 16, 1800.
			The Bishop of Loya-oc- has addressed to the laity of the metropolitan diocess a Pastoral Letter upon a point on which the appeal is certainly re- quired, though it cannot be said the Church has failed in its duty. That point, as the Bisnop explains, is in general terms " Church Extension." though what he is speciaUy called on to advocate is the London Diocesan Church Building Society. When the public, familiar as they are with large operations, ample revenues, and round sums, hear what this Society has received from a diocess of two millions and a-half of souls during this year of activity and abun- dance, they wiU conclude there must be something to explain, and that the intervention of a Bishop waas not an expedient above the occasion. The So- ciety has received from landowners, we presume towards the building of churches on their own ground, 2,3301. ; in the form of annual subscrip- tions, 2881.; donations, 6931. ; ditto for specified objects, 9761.; collections in churches, 5841.; total, 4,8711. That is all which the Society, with this high-sounding title, this grand design, and these splendid auspices, has coUected from the religious edifices of the largest, wealthiest, and, as we are daily told, the most Christian cityin the world. Why, many a ginshop in Seven Dials would soon be in the Gazette if it did not receive more for its own share from the drinking or smoking members of the community. Compared with the wants of London the total is infinitesimaL It is superfluous to analyze such poverty. Nobody peeps into a beggar's waUet, and when the whole sum is beneath notice it does not signify much that the heart and core of this revenue, its annual subscriptions, are 2881. That is about the sum that wiU be given at the approaching picture sales for one of the least known, least finished, and least characteristic works of any lately deceased painter in watercolours, and is much less than the cost of many a wedding trousseau. No wonder the good Bishop anticipates the objection that the Society is hardly worth the trouble, or that some other way
			i'ght be suggested for doing the thing better. It certainly is a failure, and there must be something amiss ; otherwise, of course, -we should not have this appeaL But, not to seem to aggravate this failure, or make it mean more than it doLs, it is necessary at once to observe that this Society only does a small proportion of the work, most of which is done either without it altogether or with very small aid from it. During the four years of Dr. TArr's episcopate he has con- secra'ted 29 new churches; that is at the rate of more than seven a-year. This he considers to meet the wants of at most 90,000 persons, whereas the probable increase of population in the diocess has been 140,000. Even supposing, then, that Roman Catholics and Dissenters have been as active as the Church, it will folow that altogether we have only just kept pace with the increase of population, and have left the enormous arrears without a remedy. Most of our metropolitan readers wil feel that they do not require any statistics, or Society reports, for information on this point. They know something of the London churches and the London people, and they know ho;v these stand the one to the other. The truth is, no average hits the case ; and, were the reports and returns ever so flattering, it would only mean that churches are abundant here, wanting there, and that the wealthy, or they who live in good houses, take care to provide themselves with churches. Wherever there have been built two or three hundred houses, with a rental of 301. a-year, there a church will answer as a pecuniary specula- tion, and, once projected, will probably be built on a handsome scale and design. But there wil still be wanting tho Church of the Poor.
			The Bishop appeals very earnestly to the claims which the poor have on those who lRve by their labour; claims substantially the same as those
			which have fringed gentlemen's parks with pic- turesquely-constructed cottages, and made the vil- lage church an almost necessary comaplement of the landscape. Employers have only to hunt out their men in aley and court, and they wiU find families as Interesting, and as much in naed of re- ligion, as that at the pretty lodge or the model farm. All this is strIctly and sternly true. The relations of property and labour are the same everywhere, and were logic the rulo of life there would be no need for Pastoral Letters. But the simple fact that things are not as they ought to be, and that the Diocess of London is not in the same state as the rural districts of the favourite countie3, sends us back to inquire how this comes to pass. We must not expect that all people wiU act byTule of Three. If they act differ- ently it is because the circumstances are different, and it becomes us then to adapt our plans to those circumstances. Vain is it, we grieve to say, to raise up moral visions in a crowded and dingy metropolis. The squire and his lively sons, the lady and her kind daughters, the pastor and the parsonage, and aU the rest that, barring a few ruffles and an occasional hitch, goes on so smoothly on the estate of a great proprieter,-all have a secret and a charm of their own. The chief secret of the whole consists in a warm mutual interest, and distinctly defined social relations. Power, authority, influence, dependence, order,-in a word, nature itself, blend all into one family, in which the landlord or the clergyman feels a real and natural interest in the people, only second to that he has for his own wife Anil Ahi11rAn
			Far different is the relation between em- ployer and employed, or landlord and tenant, when the one party knows not even the faces, names, or localities of the other, and only regards them as dishonest and degraded beings, practising every art of conspiracy and im- posture to evade lawful claims on their labour or their purse. Far different when the employed are only a class, changing their masters, their habitations, and, too often, their companions, from year to year, if not oftener. Unfortunately, the hackneyed phrase of the philanthropist who appeals-to us for the " masses" is too true to the fact. There are masses that we have to deal with ; rude masses; uninviting masses; human nature in oceans and swamps, rather than rivers and lakes. It is a great Dismal Swamp of human existence for which the Bishop pleads. This is the true scene of modern martyrdom. A colony at the Antipodes, a Northern County, the Punjab, Jamaica, Central Africa, and British Columbia, afl have their charms for this or that temperament or period of life. There is scarcely any position that may not be sweetened with matrimony and 1,0001. a-year. Even the Parliamentary curate's stipend of 801. is wealth and happiness to a young bachelor who can ride colts, or has good health. Suffering and death themselves may be made attractive by picturesque circumstances and the prospect of a weUl written biography. You will not live to lose the manners of society, or return home to be detected in Feejee provincialisnms. Far otherwise is it to the man who devotes himself to the pastoral duties of a clergyman, or even a good neighbour in a poor and populous metropolitan district. He sacrifices everything,-fortune, health, connexions, manners, tone, aspect, cheer- fulness, wit, the whole exterior,-ay, more than the exterior, of the English gentleman. When the Apostle wished himself accursed for the Jews he could not have imagined an earthly lot in which the sacrifice could be so nearly con- summated. The man who spends his days among the London poor, and his nights for them, may acquire the odour of sanctity, but he will lose that of society. Even among the saints he can hardly expect to shine so bright or cut so good a figure as the man who has ministered in handsome churches and splendid drawing-rooms to the wants of a 'West-end congregation.
			All experience shows that a population of this sort, and in this condition, cannot be dealt with as the simple folk within sight or sound of a village church, or even the small knot of gentry and tradespeople in a country town. In those vast metropolitan parishes,-three exceeding 35,000 says the Bishop; four more exceeding 30,000; five more exceeding 25,000; six more exceeding 20,000, and so on,-altogether sixty-six parishes exceeding 10,000, we have a chaos of social elements, a dead level of conditions, a mere undeveloped mine of moral qualities. This is not the case for individual agencies, marvellous and even miraculous as they have proved in some emergencies. Ordinary men cannot breast such waves, and even extraordinary men may fal. The Bishop hails missionary enterprise, but hopes more from any scheme for subdividing parishes into manageable districts. The latter is the work to be promoted by the Diocesan Church Building Society. Of course, there must be both churches and clergy- men, and we hope eventually to see them adjusted one to the other. But, as there are not churches, or the churches that are, so we are told, are but ill- attended; as clergy engaged in this hard service require mutual help and countenance; as the spiritual war is, in fact, the invasion of an enemy's territory, we cannot help thinking the Bishop would get more sympathy, more money, and more men for a well devised missionary work, framed to the scale of the whole metropolis, than for more " churches," in the vulgar sense of the word. The hand- some church, on a costly site, with its actual or threatened tower, its permanent endowment, and its staff of petty officers, is the Church's three- decker, on which we spend so much, and so often find to be useless. What we really want Is the flotila of gunboats, to push into lanes and alleys. We want something more locomotive than church and steeple; more winning even than reredoses and copes; sweeter than church bells; and more penetrating than either the feet or the eloquence of dignified rectors. If the Church does not adapt her means to the end, and make it a " day of " little things," Dissenters and even Roman CatholiEcs will. In fact, this is what they are doing; and this it is that enables them to make up for their immense disadvantages in social rank and position.

			T'he application of anithmetic to political or moral problems has not hitherto been attended with any great success. The great LAPFLCE has, indeed, calculated the exact period at which belief in Christianity would cease by estimating the degree in which. the probability of the truth of testimony is diminished by the lapse of time, and calculating the period when, ac- cording to this formula, that probability would become infinitely small. M. ApAGo calculated precisely the greater probability of an inno- cent man being convicted if a jury were not required to be unanimous, and Ifr. GaDnsTo.m suoceeded in proving, to his own satisfaction at least, that the probability of a transmission of the Apostolical succession to a Bishop of the present day was as eight thousand to one. We never heard of anybody who was convinced by any of these calcu- lations, not, indeed, because they were in them- selves incorrect, but because the cdatoa on which they are framed are to the last degree arbitrary and conventionaL Who can estimate by the same formula by which We measure time and sp3ce the effect of time in diminishing the probability of truth ? Cauas may even occur in which the exact contrary would be the result. On what asUInption are we to calculate the pro.
			bability of guilt and innocence in the accused, coupled with the probability of a true or false deci- sion in the jury? And how vain must be any attempt to estimate by figures the probability or improbabi- lity of the due and proper performance of a solemn religious rite ! It was, we presume, from a sense of the inapplicability of figure3 to such reasonings that Mlr. C-NNIXG sneered at the absurdity of requir- ing every borough to return its member by the Rule of Three. But he might have gone yet further, and observed, not merely that the e-xact weight which each borough ought to have in the constitu- tion was not to be ascertained by the Rule of Three, but also that it was a barren and profitless waste of ingenuitY to seek to ascertain it at aU with any great precision.
			The question of enfranchisement and dlsfran- chisement would be simple indeed, could it be treated in the same way as in America, -where the niumber of members returned to Congress varies in proportion to the population, as ascertained by the last census, the proportion being at this moment as one to a population of 75,O00. WVe do not quarrel with this institution in America, not because we believe it to have produced any remarkably good effects, but because we believe it to have been perfectly un- avoidablo. The Constitution of America is really a treaty between a number of sovereign and inde- pendent States, by which they agree to intrust certain strictly defined and clearly enumerated powers to a single Central Government, in which they are aU to be represented. It is the fashion to talk of the Senate, to which each State sends two re- presentatives, as being in an especial manner the re- presentative of the federal principle, but it must never be forgotten that the House of Representa- tives in Congress was also composed on federal principles. In the formation of the Senate the larger States made a great concession to the smaUer. New York was content to count for no more than Rhode Island, and Virginia for no more than New Jersey. In the House of Assembly this inequality had to be redressed. The House was still a federal council, but a federal council in which each of the States claimed to be represented according to its interest in the confederacy, and the test of that interest and the measure of the amount of the representation were taken to be population. No arrangement could be more reasonable, or, indeed, more inevitable. But the English House of Commons is not the represent- ative of the interests of a number of sovereign States confederated together for specific purposes carefully enumerated in a written compact. The House of Commons is the representative Chamber of a nation, one and undivided. Each member of the House is, as soon as he is elected, a member for the whole of the United Kingdom and every part of it. There is nothing federal in his appointment, and for this simple reason all the reasoning in favour of electoral districts derived from the analogy of America falls entirely to the ground. That is the best electoral district, not which is most nearly equal to other electoral districts, but which returns the best member to Parliament. In comparison with this one consideration, all other merits are trivial and unimportant. A great deal of inequality may be better tolerated than a smaU amount of inefficiency. Our first care should be that the electoral district secures the object of its institution ; any attempt to remove the jealousies of other electoral districts should be strictly subordinated to this primary object.
			vvitn tnese remarks we would call the atten- tion of our readers to two letters which have appeared in our columns, addressed to us by Mr. DAVID CifADWICK. Mr. CnIADwIcx is not content that our Parliament should be repre- sented according to the rules of arithmetic. So far from thinking that symbolical reasoning is unsuit- able to such a subject, he seeks for some more accurate and powerful notation to express his thoughts, and may be congratulated as the inventor of a science which we can denominate by no other name than that of Parliamentary algebra. To estimate with precision the amount of representa- tive power which each borough and county ought to possess, Mr. DAVID CHADWICK would take two elements,-the amount of the population in 1851, and the annual value of the property assessed to the Poor-rate. These he adds together, people and pounds, and then, assuming ten thousand as the unit, and dividing the sum of these numbers by ten thousand, he elicits what he calls a mean or composite number, which is "a clear
			and fair index of the right of each county and "borough to representation." Thus he deduces, that if the value of each English and Welsh member of Parliament is taken to be twenty tour, the valuo in Scotland will be twenty nine, and in Ireland seventeen, and he ap- plies this test to tlhe Ministerial Reform Bill, which seems, on the whole, to come out better than might have been expected from a measure sub- mitted to conditions with which it was never in- tended to comply. We have already given our reason for thinking this scheme of Mr. DAVID CHADWICK a very superfluous piece of ingenuity. Provided that every interest and every class of opi- nion which commands the assent of any considerable number of persons be fairly represented in Parlia- ment, we see nothing to be gained by this attempt at an accuracy and precision which is in the first place unattainable ; in the second, cannot be retained Hf acquired; and, in the third place, would answer, so far as we can see, no really useful purpose. What better ilius- tration can we have of the inaccuracy of the data upon which the calculation is to be founded than the fact, that in this progressive country we are directed to assume that the census of 1851 gives a correct return of the relative numbers of the population in 1860, unless it be the assumption that the valuation for the purposes of the Poor- rate, notoriously made on principles the most discordant from each other, will give us a correct account of the relative value of real property throughout the country ? But, even if this were so, how long would it remain so ? Suppose that we had-which we have not-the means of making the calculation exact for the present year, how long will it be before trade and emigration, and railways, and physical dis- coveries, and caprice and fashion alter the balance which has been struck ? Are we to have a periodical revision, after the fashion of America, after every census, or after every fresh assessment to the Poor-rate ? Are we to have a fresh Reform Bill every year, or are we to devise, as in America, some self-acting machinerybywhichthe balance shall adjust itself ? Even so we shall not have arrived at accuracy, for the importance of a place depends not wholly either on the number of its population or the value of the real property it contains, but also in a great degree on the personal property of its inhabitants. Of this the scheme takes no notice, and we therefore feel justified in saying that it aims at an accuracy far greater than the subject requires, and fails to attain the accuracy at which it aims.

			Unusual interest attaches under present circum- stances to the "sixth" and last "Report of the " PosrAAs=-Gm,znu on the Post-office." That deparbnent is just now on its defence, and has even charged itself wvith a qpedal investigation of its own defects. It will, perhaps, favour the public hereafter with a special Report, but, in the mean- time, here is its annual manifesto,-an official dodument directly recommended to us as furnish-
			ing information mora correct than is to be picked up from current stories or unfounded attacks. We turn, therefore, with some curiosity to see wvhat can be said. The charges brought against the de- partment are now generally understood. It is alleged that the chief office is defective in accommodation
			that its servants are inadequately remunerated; that the service, as a niaural consequence, is im- perfectly performed, and, especiaUy in the case of newspapers, grudgingly rendered; and that all this occurs because the diversion of a very large portion of the proper revenue of the office to the national Exchequer has led to parsimony and stint in the service itself. Let us see what the Report tells us in these particulars.
			In the yearlS59 the public paid forthePost-office service the sum of 3,448,0741. The actual cost of that service was 2,312,1141., so that a net profit or surplus remained of 1,135,9601. Here, then, is the first great fact. Cheap as postage has been made, it nevertheless yields a very large gain, and, as far as the Post-offico itself is concerned, it is plain that the department could afford either to do its work for two-thirds of the present charge or to increase by one-third the accommodation furnished to the public. Upwards of a million a-year is paid by the pablic to the Post-office which is not expended on Post-office service, but which is paid over as a disposable sur- plus to the account of the national reve- nue. The MIoney Order Department alone yields a clear profit of all but 30,0001. a-year. It is clear, therefore, that if the service of the Post- office is in any way stinted, it is not for lack of funds or insufficiency of charges. The postage duties are some 50 per cent. higher than they need be for the mere payment of Post-office expenses, and unless, therefore, it is assnmed that the Ex- chequer has a preferential claim upon these returns, there is so much clear margin for liberality and improvement.
			We next come to the rate of salaries current in the establishment, and to the general condition of the servants employed in it. Here the Report, excepting in one particular, is not very satisfactory. WVe are, indeed, assured that the wages of letter- carriers are sufficient; that thero is no ground for the impressions current on this subject ; that men of good eharacter and ability can always be found to undertake the work on such terms, and thatthe delinquencies so rife in the department arise, not from inderpayment, but from the temptations which, in so large a body of men, must always find victims. We are even warned against circulating any reports of a contrary tendency, and are re- minded of the responsibility which rests upon us in this respect. The PosT3nsTFR-GLNx-1uA " would "appeal to the good feeling of those who conduct "the public press to be very cautious in promul- " gating reports which may tend to render these "officers discontented and restless, and to produce "those evils whieh, happily, have hitherto existed " only in imagination." We can oDly reply that we have not the slightest desire to prejudge the matter. From the informiation we have acquired we doubt very much whether the discontents prevailing in the establishment are either so partial or so groundless as the Report assumes; but on this head we say no more at present. WVe close at once with the particular offer to which we referred as decidedly satis- factory. We are told that the department is always ready to enlighten any respectable applicant on these subjects, and that " if the information so "obtained be not considered satisfactory, there is "always the resource of a Parliamentary inquiry." That is precisely the resource we have suggested. Let there be a Parliamentary inquiry by all means, and let the system stand or fall by the
			rpncnlt:
			As the PosTmsTi:a-G txAT,M ho-wever, has made an appeal to us, we now make one to him; and we address ourselves, not to his " good feeling" merely, but to his sense of justice and public duty. Whatever may be the case with the Post-office ser- vants, the evils complained of by newspapere are certainly not confined " to the imagination alone." Our grievances are very real and palpable. We complain that we have been graduaUy deprived of aU our ancient rights, until at length it is designed to exclude us from the use of the letter-box alto- gether. We say that, step by step, and year after year, a design has been pursued of effacing our distinctive character, of treating us simply as so much printed matter, and thrusting us out of the category of letters, to find a place in that of books and parcels. The Re- port before us consistently carries out this idea by classing " newspapers and books " under a distinct head, and suggesting a doubt whether we do not bring rather a loss than a profit to the office. Against this system, in the intercst of the public no less than our own, we once more aprotest. We protest against the principle which would con- fuse a daily periodical with an ordinary printed book. WVe protest against a system which ignores a plain and imperative public want. Ever since the foundation of a free press was laid in the first " newsletters" these publications have been car- ried and delivered by the post, not merely like other letters, but with special privileges of their own. They had the right, in virtue of their impressed stamps alone, not only of transmission, but of retransmission. They had, in fact, the free run of the post, and were preferred to ordinary letters in the treatment they received. All this has now been changed. By one enactment after another we have been limitedcin weight, subjected to extra taxation, and curtailed of our rights of retransmission. Finally, if Sir RowLxim HILI's views are carried out, we
			shall be no longer recognized as newspapers at all. | We shall be regarded only as so many bundles of print, to be carried and delivered, according to weight, along with ordinary books and parcels. Now, we ask why this should be done � Nobody pretends that the press has degenerated, or that it is a less eligible instrument of public instruction than it was in times past. Nobody can maintain that the public cares less for newspapers than it did, or that it is less solcitous about early intelligence. On the contrary, we are perpetually told that the free circulation of inteUi- gence by the agency of newspapers is most desirable, and taxes have been abolished for the express fur- therance of this very purpose. Why, then, is the public to be deprived in this matter of the advan- tages of a national establishment like the Post- office ? The answer is plain, though by no means satisfactory. We are to be turned out of the letter-box because it will otherwise be too small for its contents. The Post
			office has not grown with the age, and it finds its work too much for it. It cannot do what it used to do, and although, as we have shown, it has ample funds for purposes of expansion, although the increase of its proper revenue has grown with the increase of correspondence, it still remains unequal to its duties, aud is now deliberately pre- paring to repudiate them rather than incur the expense of becoming equal to its work. We say that these principles are bad, and that the revenue resulting from such a system is revenue raised by most injudicious taxation. Government undertakes a great national duty, and makes a great profit by it. To this profit there can be no objection, but it should surely be a prelimi- nary condition that the duty is first well per- formed. As it is, the action of the press, so loudly and universally extoUed, is to be fettered, in order that more saving may be effected in the adrministra- tion of a public establishment. This we believe to
			be doubly wrong. It is wrong because it curtails a privilege of confessed public utility, and it is wrong again because a more liberal administration would be reDaid by greater custom, and the profits in the end b3 as considerable as before.

			HEJR IAJESrrS TEBATRD.
			The new manager has commenced his first Ecasounith spirit, in the course of a singlo week hsving presented hi7
			subscribers with no less than three operas-Martha, La Farorita, and R Troratore. Trne, in the matter of decoration, scenery, and costume the same works have been glven elsewhere in a more generally im- posing style, the chorus woula bear reinforcement, and the orchestra, although a good many excellent players figure in its ranks, and two practised conductors (Mr. Benedict and Signor Arditl) successively direct the perfermances, is not so thoroughly efficient at all points as might be desirable; but these slight drawbacks are counter- balanced by declded attractions before the footlights, elther in tho shape of singers of eminence with whom the pabllc has only of recent years become ao quainted, or of others, who, whhUe eqtally celebrated abroad, are quite new to this country. Thefir3t representa. tion of La Favorita, besides bringing forward Signor Mongini, the new tenor of last year, in a pasrt which he had not Dreviously essayed in England, introduced Madame Borghl-Mamo and Signor Everardi, both of whom appeared for the first time. The name of the gentleman was littlelkown, exceptto those whomake themselves ecqualuted with all that goes on from year to year in the operatic world; but that of the lady was preceded by a reputatlon only, if indeed at -II, inferior to whatis awarded to talent of the highest distinction. In Paris and in other Continental towvns Madame Borghi-MIamo is recognized as a dramatic singer of the first class, her repertory comprising maost of the favourite parts of Alboni, together with some that Albonl has never attempted. Her voice is a "mero soprano" of wide compass and fine quality, her style of singing remarkable alike for propriety and depth of expres- sion, and her execution brilliant, if not always asfluent and refined as belongs to the Italian school in its perfection. In the first act of La -Farorita Madame Borghi-Mamo did
			net create a very marked sensation, but In the second, the duet where Leonora reproaches tho ling with his perfidy revealed qualities which at once awakened interest; and from that point to the end of the opera the impression produced by Madame Borghi-Mamo on the audience became more and more favourable. Tho slow movement of the aIr, "0 nio Fernando," was given with exquisite feeling, and showed, moreover, that among the acquirements of the new singer wva that very rare one, a " mezzavoce" well sustained and perfeotly in tune. The allkgro was an energetio and effective display, the return to the subject being preceded by an elaborate cadence, conceived in good taste and faultlessly accom- plished. In the last scene-comprisIng the duet which terminates with the death of the pardoned and repentant Leonora--Madame Borghi Alamo produced a sensible effect by tLe most legitimate means. Her appeal to Fernando, " 0 ciel! Fernando, il tu perdono Jo spero," was truly impassioned, wlthoat being in any sense exaggerated; and in the famous exclamation, where the theme is given first alternately and then by the two voices tn unison ("Vieui, aa ! vieni,") she rivalled Signor Mongin] in emphasis and power, emulating him al3s in that free em- ployment of the " terapo rubato" which it is not always easy for an orchestra to follow. Signor Mongini, who sang throughout the opera with more judicious reticence and a more nniform command of his physical means than on any previous occasion, winning and merlting unanimous sym- pathy by his very admirable delivery of the beautiful air, "Spirto gentil" (which was re-demanded and re- peated), fairly divided the honoars with his accomplished partner, and the curtain descended upon a great and unquestionable success. Signor Everardi, the new bary- tone, is a decided aconisition. His voice is flexible and of excellent quality, and he sings with tho ease and judgment of a practised naster. His expression, too, Is thoroughly
			good, always earnest, while never obtrcsve. Alphonso XI. plays a somewhat contemptible part in the opera ; nor Is his music, except in one scene (where the composer has allotted him an air the style of which is curiously at variance v.ith the sentiment of the situation), at aU calculated to exhibit tho art of the singer to advantage. Of this solitary chance, however, Signor Everardi avaUed himself with eminent ability ; and never, perhaps, was tho popular " A tanto amor" rendered with more genuine feeling. The voice well bahanced, the pianissifo admirably sns. tained, and the phrasing-in spite of a certain tremulous. ness, easily accounted for on such an occasion-always large and expressive, a more thoroughly artistic reoading could hardly be imagtned. Before, however, the powers of Signor Everardi can be fully and justly estimated he must be heard in a part more favourable to their display. Signor Vialetti gave due significance to the cbaracter of Baldas- eare, and sang the whole of his music with excellent effect, especially those passages in thejinale of the secondactwhero the indignant ecclesiastic launches the anathemas of the Church at the head of the Castilian Monarch.
			By her impersonation of Azucena, the gipsy, in Verdi's Trovatore, on Saturday night, Madame Borghi Mamo mere than confirmed the favourable opinions elicited on the occa. eion of her first appearance. Thero was nothing So strikingly new, in a vocal or histrionic seose, as to caU for a compari- son of her performance with that of either of her great predecessors in this country; but, while she cannot be cre- dited with the dramatic energy of Madame Viardot, or the faultless vocalization of Madamo Albonl, sho exhibits a eustoined excelence, the result of careful consideration and zealous endeavour, that leaves little or nothing to desire. Her Azucena is complete and satisfactory from whatever point of view regarded, and in singling out, as its grandest feature, the scene where the Gipsy-in mnsic as wild and declamatory as, in its way, it is picturesque- narrates to Maunrico the history of her wrongs and her re- venge, we merely suggest that where Signor Verdi has aimed at the highest expression, and laid on his colours with the boldest and most unflinching hand, Madame Borghl- Mnmo's performance attainms the culminatIng point. Iler delivery of the concluding words, when, after her frantlc confession, Azunena sinks, exhausted, on the conch, was singularly forcible. Perhaps, on the whole- vith one important exception-the Trovoto,'c has never been more effectively given. Mademoiselle Titiens was magn7il
			cent as Leonora, and frequently raised the audience to enthusiasm. Her " aria cVintrata.," as it is conventionally termed (the well-known "Tacea la notte ') vras one of the finest vocal displays with which she has hitherto delighted her English admirers, her share in the " Miserere" (as nsual, encored) admirably pathetic, the duet with Conte di Luna, when Leonora swallows the poison, instinct with vigour and passlon, and that with Maurico, in which the injust reproaches of her
			lover aro arrestea Dy the hand of death, in every respect truthful, dramatic, and impressivo. Signor Gioglini, too (whose recovery was probably accele- rated by the great success of Slgnor Mongini, his substitute in LZa Favorita, on the previous Thursday), sang in many iustances his very best, proving that, though somo slight traces of indisposition were stil occasionally evident, the printed apology issued on his behalf was altogether superfluous. His " Ah si ben mio," a perfect example of the cantabile style, was deservedly encODred,-and no- thing could well bo more exquLsite than his delivery of the beautiful phrase (" Ah che Ia mnorte I) which contrasts so melodiously with the sombro strains of tho " Miserere " and the exclamations of the distracted Leonora. The Conte di Luna of Signor Aldighierl was by no means on a level with the general ex- deUence of the rest, and tho impression produced on the audience was not seldom in an inverse ratio to the efforts of the singer, who cannot besaid to fdl for want of zeal, however that zeal may occasionally outrun discretion. Nevertheless, Signor Aldighierl is quite young enough to improve, and must learn to husband his means.
			After the opera the diverlisscmcnt of leur des Chlamps wvas performed, the consummnate dancing of diademoisello Pocchinl cres' 'ug a sensation unprecedented since the days wfhen the LZumleyanbaUlet was In its zenith, and Terpoichoro reigned supreme. For such an artist. as this lady it would ho s-urely judiious to provideesomething new, insteadof exhibit. ting her admirabletslentiuworn outobredseand patchesl. The house was thefufest of the season, and the Royal hex wan occupiedbv the Dnchess of Cambridge, the Princess Ir and other personsof distinction.

			TBB SCOTCH RzBFOIS BILL.-REPRESMNTATONr OFLANA1m;s uER.-Ageneral meeting of the justices of the peace, commissioners of supply, and electors of the county of Lanark, was held in Hamnilton on Friday last to consider the propriety of petitioning both Houses of Parliah. ment to grant a second member to that county in addition to the two new members already proposed to be given to Scotland by the Representation of the People (Scotland} Bill, now depending beforo Parliament. Tho chatr was occupied by the Right Hon. Lord Belbaven, convener of the county, and there was an influential attendanco of county gentlemen. Resolutions were unanimously passed to the effect that, considering the great importance of tho various s_ricaltural and commercial interests of Lanark- sbire, its vast population (200,000, exolusive of Glasgow and the other Parliamentary hurghs), its great wealth, and the amoumt of its tasation, it was justly entitlod to recciv, a second reuresentativo in the Honue of Commons ; and patitions to both Houses (to be intrusted to Lord Belhaven and Sir E. T. Colebrooke) were adopted. Sir E. Cole- brooke, member for the county, was present, and in a sbort speech e-pressed his concurrenco in the object of the meet. ing, at the same time holding out little hope, so far as he knew, that it would be gained at the present time, and stating that he would exercise his discretion, when the mat- t.r camue before the House. so as to secure their object, it p,s,ible, and yet not to endanger the safety of the Bill.

			THE BISHOP OF LONDON ON CHUBCH
			EXTENSION IN LONDON-0.
			ADDRESS TO TE LAITY OF LOTNDON.
			mlle Disnop or won&lt;ton Ms addressed the follow- ing pastoral letter to the laity of the metropolitan dioess:-
			"London-house, April, 1860,
			C,"Dear Brethreu,-I desire to bring under your notice the alms of the London Diocesan Church BuildingY Society. I am aware that the very name of church building Is almost apt at the present time to excite a prejudice with many, lice, in their impatience to find new ways of curing old evils, many have begun to think that the old-established remedies are useless. YouL are not to understand from its name that this society confines itself to the eretidon of the material house of God, though this, doubtless, is its iasin object. It might more appropriately be designated a paro- chial extension society. It strives in every way to extend and strengthen our parochial system, and a little considera- tion ought to convince us that without such extension, of which the buildlng of new churches is a necessary and ln- tegral part, we cannot hring spiritual privileges within the reach of the masses of our people.
			" The d,ocess of London contains, as nearly as can be cal- cuslated, 2,500,000 inhabitants. It Is divided into 433 parishes or parochial districts, and these are served by 855 clergy. Making foll allowance for that portion of our popula- tion which is connected with some body of Christians other than the Established Church. and consideriing the provision which such bodies have made for the instruction and pastoral superintendence of their own members, I maintain that there Is still a vast amount of spiritual destltution-that in to say, a vast multitude of sonic in this metropolis beyond the reach of religious ordinances, with no place supplied in which they may worship God, and no efficient arrangements made for their religions instruction In health and their con- solation in sickness or on the approach of death.
			" A-n arithmetical calculation of the relative proportions of churches, clergy, and people in the diocess by no means 8ves an accurate view of the magnitude of this evil. It is inseparable from the arrangements of our ancient parochial system that there musb be among us great inequalities. Many narishes are adequately, or more than adequately snpi, huttespefute of one district cannot by any arrangement be made properly to minister to the deficiences of another. The clergy of country parishes can be of no use to distant town populations, and in London itself the dis- tricts which are inhabited by the rich are many of them separated by miles from those parishes with an overwhelm- Ing population which have come to be inhabited almost ex- clusively by the poor. Again, while there is comparativelv no great difficulty in providing new churches in what are considered the richer districts, where the clergy are almost sure of a sufficient maintenance, there Is, on the other hand no possibility, without the greatest efforts, of procuring either churches, or endowments, or clergy for very poor places. It is especially to the wants of such places that I would now most earnestly beg your attention.
			" There are in this diocess three parisbes, with popula- tions exceeding 35,000, four with between 30,000 and 35,000, five with between 25n,000 and 30,000, six with between 320with,between 10,000 anfO hdb e 15,00,0ow, whatever diver-
			sityof pinon xist amng sa s tothedesrabeness of not carrying the snb,xiivisimononf old psarioshes too far, there is, I believe, hut one opinion, that such parishes as I have now mentioned ought to be subdivided. The parochial prin- Ciple is lost when we come to such multitudes. They can- not meet together in one house of God, nor be subieoted to one efficient system of pastoral superintendence or visita- tion. Moreover, the subdivlsion of overgrown into manage- able districts always leads to the multiplication of schools and diffuses more widely the advantages derived from dis- trict visiting, from provident soc'eties, dispensaries, and alt the other subsidiary parochial arrangements which every active clergyman strives to attach to the ministrations of his church.
			"I am perfectly aware how much must be done, by efforts of a directly missionary kind, before large neglected parishes can be brought into such a state as to be ready to receive the foU benefits of parochial subdivisdon. We re- ,oice at the efforts which are being made in the present day to facilitate such missionary work. The society for which l plead, supplying missionary curates asa temporary expedient to districts in process of formation, is nob behind other societies In recognizing and endeavouring to increase such agency. But temporary expedients, to be fully blessed, must be directed towards Eome permanent organization for which they are preparatory, and to which they are expected at last to give way. I feel myself, therefore, justified in pleading that no other effort, however important, ought to be ailowed to interfere with our great work of parochial ex- tension. The poor of London have a strong claim upon the rich to provide them with those blessings of regularly
			established permanent religious ordinances which all who I know the value of the Gospel of Christ so greatly prize. All
			who receive any portion of their income from the rent of I houses inhabited by the poor, or of the ground on which I such houses are built, are especially bonnd, in God's sight, to i do what they can to provide for the spiritual wants of their I tenants. Ail the rich, whoderivefromthelabour of thepoor so large an amount of tho enjoyments of life, are bound to pay back some portion of this debt by attending to the souls of the poor. In the country the claim of the labourer or poor
			tenant to have a church and schools and the ministrations of a I clergyman placed within his reach is allowed by his landlord or employer. Ought we not to considerthat the poor of Lon- don are, many of them, attracted from their country homes and induced to settle In the densely-peopled districts of the metropolis by the presence of the rich, for whom they
			labour, and whose dependents they are as truly, while I living unseen in their distant squalid homes in narrow streets I or neglected suburbs, as if they were the inhabitants of I pleasant cottages, clustering round their employer's park?I I would suggest that those who live in districts weU sup- plied w,ith Church ordinances should pay a visit of personal inspection to the poor neglected parishes, and consider w-ith themsselves what means can be adopted to make one district and another which is In need. A t the office of the London
			Diocesan Church Building Society all informationn, may be readily obtained upon the Important subject I of the present inadequate provision for supplying the spiritual necessities of the metropolis, and the mode in which new works, to remedy the existing evil may most effectively be undertaken. I beg to urge those who are not acquainted with the society to read its papers and personally to consult its officers, that they may understand
			ow great and pressing ia its work. The sums contributed to this societv durbs the nast vear have been as follows !-
			" This sum Is, of course, a very inadequate expression of what is really doing among us, as many noble examples are continually occurring of munificent donatiens to Individual objects not contributedthroughtheDlocesanSociety. Butno amount of separate private exertion can dispense with the necessity for a central faund. The great manjority of the schemes of parochial extension set on foot by private muni- ficence still require some addition from a public source. Without the encouragement which the grants from such a g'uish anford there ae districtssopoor and neglected andwith so little claim, except from their poverty,upon any of the rlch, that little can be honed from them unless such a society as cure undertakes the whole direction of the schemes in- tended to henefit them. The present state of the society's funds entirely precludes the possibility of its undertaking any extensive works of this description on Its own responi. bility. The whole .ggregate of what is done falls very short of what ought to be done, and I am justified in urging aU seriously to consider before God what are their duties in thIs matter.

			DUJ.S4-N, FRm.&amp;Y MoxnsaG, CHURCH EDucAnojj7 SOCrETY,
			The annual meeting of the society came off yester- day at the Rotunda, the Earl of Bandon preaiding. The proceedings opened -with the reading of the report-an unusually long document this year, but in tone and matter differing in no striking respect from its predecessorS. As ruight be anticipated, It commences vith an allsion to the "agitationa" created by the receipt of the memorable letter of the Primate recommending a compromise-a pro- position which the society sternly refuses to enter- tain, as being contrary to the principle of " no sar- render." The report says,-
			"While the committee cordlaUy concur in that part of the advice which his Grace gave to the patrons of such Churah ElucAion Schools as are languishing from want of support, to make prompt exertions to raise them from that depressed condition, it is with extreme and unfeigned regret they are obliged to dissent from the recommendation that any of the patrons of Church Education Schools, however circumstanced, should place them under the Board of National Education, so long as its rules with regard to religions instruction, so derogatory to the Word of God, remain essentially unchanged."
			And again,-
			" Your committee are persuaded that those patrons of Church Education Schools who have so distinctly, so repeat- edly, and so recently declared that their objection to the national system is one of principle and conscience, will not allow any plea of necessity, however urgent, to induce them to do violence to conscience by abandoning, in the educa- tion of the poor, the great princlple of the Protestant Be- formation respecting the use of Holy Scriptures, for the maintenance of which they have so long, so earnestly, and so faithfully contended."
			Of the operations of the society the report gives the following statistics:-
			" The number of schools in connexion wlth our society for the year ending the 31st of December, 159 vas 1,615, and that of the pupils attending them 78,487. bivided ac- cording to religious denominations the pupils maY be thu arransed:
			T'he gross Income of the soclety from all sources during the past year amounted to 41,9381. 17s. ld, showing an in- creas,e, of 2,1681. 2s. d over the receipts of the preceding
			In conClusion, the Committee emphatically renew tsheir solemn protest against the principle of the naBtional system, on the old ground of its imposing restrictions on the free sse of the ScriptureS; and the Primate's advice is again repudiated in this passag-
			"The solemn question has to be deoided, whether our Scriptural schools are to be maintained, or to be absorbed in the national system, and whether the ground of our pro- test against that system is to ba abandoned, under the pressure of either real or presnmed necessity."
			Subjoined is a brief abstract of the proceedings:- " The noble Chairmen said he felt some regret that some one botter quaUfied had not been selectel to occmpy the chair, particularly as the result of their proceedings was looked forward to with considerable interest throughout Ireland. Ho should state now that the Church Education Society maintained inviolate those great principles to which ithadnov adheredformoretbana quarter of acentury. It was 17 years since he had first advocated the claims of the society in the Haouse of Comnmons, and he still ad- hered to the cause which he then supported. Having re- ferred to the publication of the Lord Prmate's letter, as well as the other document in opposition to the course pur- sued by the society, the noble chairman said that his ight honi. friend Mr. Cardweli, who would nut havw ttday thing which he cdid not believe to be true, had, in his ' answer,' stated two things which were not correct. First, he defined the conditions on which the Government would give aid to schools in Ireland, and then proceeded to give an answer to a statement with regard to the convent schools. He said the rule the Government wished to adopt was that in schools supported by State aid the education given should be of so comprehensive a character as not to exclude pupils of any Chriatien denomination. Now, he (the chairman) could state that in the great county in which he resided there were 413 non-vested schools, and not one of them answered the description given by Mr. Cardwell. The whole thing then was a mockery and a delusion. (Cheers.) Statesmen came over to Ireland and saw the model school, on which no expense wasg spared, and they were led to believe that the schools throughout the country were of the samne description. Of the schools in Cork, to which be referred, only 15 wereof laypatronage; almostall the others were under the patronage of the priests; and how could a Protestant child, properly attend a school where the priest was patron and the minister a Rtoman Catholic ? (Cheers.) Air. Cardwell had further denied that the rule of the Board to which he alluded was infringed in the con- ventual schools, although admitting that, from the
			pecutlar character of those sehools, they wrere not attended by Protestant pupils to any appreciable extent. The system, then, was one-so far as these conventual schools were con- cerned-to exclude Protestants, and yet those schools re- ceivd Sateaid.(Chers Havng henstated the nature of the suggestions madee inthePrimate's lettaterthe speaker proceeded to say that if the society gave up the principles on which it was constituted, and fn accordance with which it had theretofore ,acted, the results would be disastrous. What were they asked to do? to hand over thei er schools to the National Beard. What was that in practical offset bnt to take money for the poor schools, and to hand over the rest of the money to the Roman Catholics to do as they pleased with it? (Hear, hear.) In the year 1826 there were nearly 2,000 schools in Ireland giving Scriptural edu- cation, but there was an interference with that system i
			1832. That was the first time the Parliament of England had ever sanctioned a system of public education without making it a sinc (psi non that the teaching of the Sacred Scriptures should be made a part of that educational system. The friends o Scriptural education, both in Parliament and outside, objected to that system, because it was evi- dently meant as a concession, to their disadvantage, to the Roman Catholio party. They objected to it for manyreasons, but on thatground more especially; and in the view which they took they had able and distinguished support. When the question was brought forward in the House of Lords in the year 1837, by the Bishop of Exeter, the late Duke of Wellington said that under the new system the clergy had not the power of going into the schools and teaching the Scriptures, and he objected that there was a pretence of using the Scriptures where they were, in fact not used. (Cheers.) In conclusion the noble chairman said that in Cork they were not prepared to strike their coloors, or to surrender their garrison. (Cheers.) The usefulness of their society in Cork had been greatly increased by the Ladies' Auxiliary Association. Owing to their exertions
			the local society had been enabled to esgage the services of an efficient inspector, which WaS considered of the greatest practical benefit. They had a large model school also, whlch shey fonld of the greatest possible advantage to the teachers, who, after a short training, became much improved in the system of communicating information. He (the chairman) wished much that Dr. Colhen and those who SUp- ported him had fnollowed the advice once given by a distinguished orator, who, although a Roman Catholic was entitled to their respect and admiration-be meant the ate Mr. Shiel. He said in the course of adbate on th
			Sibject of education in the House of Commons,-' I have beard much in the course of this discussion of the dogmas of theology. I do not profess to be conversant with them, but I sometimes read my Bible, in every page of which the lessens of mercy are so admirably inculcated. It occurs to me that if there be a sage a pas n which the charactero ofu Saviour is described in a peculiarly amiable manner, it is that in wbich ho Is represented as desiring his disciples not to forbid little children to come unto him. I can- not help thinking that if among the little group on whose heads He was invoked to lay His hands there had been the child of a Sadducee or a Samaritan, the God Of mercy and of love would not have put the little schismatic aside. Do not imitate the example of thoese by whom the children were rebuked. Suffer them to approach Him. Let them have accesa to the sources of pure morality, and that truth which is common to all Chrlstians. Do not CloSe the avenues of that knowledge which leads to happiness when time shaU be no more, and, instead of engaging in acrimonious contentions about ecclesiastical prerogatives and pretension; let us act on the principle contained in the Divine injunction, ' Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such Is the kingdom of Heaven." (Arinlause.)
			" Dr. TxNzcu, hon. secretary, then read the annuaIm report.
			a" The Right Hon. the Earl of CLA?rCARTY moved the doption of the report, and congratulated the meeting upon the evidence of increased finauacial prosperity contained In it. What the reuort set forth wa a re-affirmation of the
			rnil on which the society was founded. (Hear, beax.) Wecoulmdneot hut admiait that the Lord Primate's letter gave grounds ferevery layman's carefully reconsidering his views with regard to the society. He (Lord Cloncarty) would not claim for the Protestant Church an e-xcluLsive power in the direction of the education of the State; the time was gone p ast when such a claim could have been esta- blished by the burch. He hoped2 however, that the Church, notwithstandling the diminutionmi1 the number of the clergy who adhered to the principles of the society-he ho p d that the Church would still insist that scriptural education
			shiould he within the reach of every poor person In theI country. (Cheers.) He would never he silent where the honour of his God and Saviour was at stake, and he would therefore counsel them to persevere in the good course which they had theretofore so stedfastly followed. (Ap- plause.)
			" The Lord Bishop of Ossony and FERyS3 seconded the resolution, and in the course of a legtbened speech reviewed the history of the society, the objects which it vas foundedi to Promote, and the principles in accordauce with which it hoped to realise those objects. With regard to the question at issu between the Lord PrIeate and the supporters of the society, the speaker said that the arguments on both sides were doubtless Known to most of those present. and it would
			therefore be superfluous to reopen them, If there were 1 any up to that time unconvinced on one side or the other
			he (the Bishop of QOsory) would have little hope of bringing. conviction to his mind by anything which he could then cay. In fact, he could cay no more than what be had already written, andl he should therefore leave the question to the dliscussion which it had already undergone.
			The reolution was then Put and adopted nunanmously. "Th Rlb 1ev. the Lord Bishop of CAssIEL moved the -next resolu en, to the efrect that the society felt bound, in
			not only foolish but immoraL Every clergyman at his ordination made a solemn vow that he would, out of the Holy Strlptures, teach all committed to his care, whlle the course recommended in the Primate's letter involved a viola- tio, of that solemn vow. He (the Bishop of Cashel) conceivedl that f,i!ead of recommending that the poor schools of the society shoni2 be given over to the National Board, the Primate ought to bsave given a munificent contribntion to the soclety's funds, i,' thereby enabled them to carry on their poor schools. fle speake r frste4 git cousiderable length the charge of inefficdency brtghit egainAt tho nsetWs schools by the adherents of the National Board, and quoted largely from the reports of the Census and Education Comr missioners in support of his assertions.
			" Mr. RnnEBT Goanosi, D.I,., seconded the res-olution, which wzas adopted.
			"The Hon. and Rev. C. BfltSAflD moved, and Mr. RosIEST WARREN, Q.C., seconded the next resolution, whitch w;as as follow s:
			" *That, whllst we coutinue to thIk to duty o the State to o

			" The resolution was unanimously adopted.
			" The Rev. Mr. DEsw (Belfast) moved, and the Rev. Joe ALcocs seconded, the nominationi of the committee and officers for the ensuing year, which was agreed to.

			DR. LETHEBY'S ANNUAL RBPORT.
			The following is Dr. Lotheby's Annual Report on the Sanitary Condition of the City of London, just presented to the Hon. the Commissioners of Sewers:-
			"Gentlemen,-In submitting the tabulated returns of the sanitary statisties of the eity for the last 12 months, I have the satisfaction to state that they indicate a favourable condition of the public health.
			' The vital movements of the population may be ex- pressed in very few words. There have been 1,843 mar-h riages, 3,200 births, and 2,911 deaths-the mean PrOpOrtiOns for the last 10 yesrs being 1,740, 3,504, and 3,102 respeto tively. The marriages, therefore, have risen above the average, and the births and the deats have fallen below it;- and it is remarkableathat the increaseof marriages Is entirely i the central distrlets,where the births and the deaths havet hbeen so notablydmnshed. In the whole of the city the proportion of marriages in the year has been hut as one to0 20 adult males, and one to 22 adult females, or there have been 14 marriages to every 1,000 of the populaleon; the pro. ortion In England being but 8 to the 1,000, and in London axboutt 9 7.
			"The distributien of the births in the several distrcict
			has been as folowsi:-1,419 in the Eastern Union, the ave- rage being 1,467; 604 In the Western, to an averag,e of 790; a;nd 1,037 in the Central, to an average of 1,246. The pro= portion of males has been only a little above that of females, thenumnber of the formrer being 1,632, and of the latter 1,628, which is as 100-2 is to 100: In England generally it Is as 105 to 100. Again, the proporthen of births in the city to that of child-bearing women between the ages of 15 and 45 has been but as 9 to 100, whereas in the wholo of England It is as 14 to 100.
			"It is satisfactory to know that the number of deaths for the year is not only below the general average for the last decennial period, but it is even below the averrge for that time when the two cholera yeara of 1849 and 1854 are ex- cluded. Altogether the reduction of mortality has been to. the extent of rather more than 61 in the 1,000; but6the reduction has not been equal in the three districts, for it has amounted to only 13 per 1,000 in the Western division of the city, to 50 in the Eastern, and to 109 in the Central. A part of the large reduction in the last-named district Is no doubt due to a falling off in the number of the resident population, for if the death-rate is calculated according to the ce-nses returns of 1851, it will be found that while the mor- tality in the whole of the city has been atthe rate of 22-4 per 1,000 of the population in the Western division it has been as high as 27-3; in the 3astern, 26-5; and in the Central only 19-8. So that whUe 1 In 44 have died in the whole city, 1 in 36 have died in the Western districts - I in 39 in the Eastern; and only 1 in 56 in the Central. in all Eng- land the annual mortality is at the average rate of 22-3 per 1,000 of the population ; in country districts it is only 20; and in the large towns it is nearly 26. If, therefore, the city mortality is measured by these standards, it does not appear, on the whole, to be unsatisfactory ; and it certainly presents a very favourable contrast to the high death-rate of our large towns. This indeed wiU be more apparent hereafter, hut still it cannot be denied that there are
			istricts in the city where the mortality is excessive ; these, however, are the localtites of the poor, where other influ- ences besides dirt and overcrowding are at work; for, in spite of al our sanitary efforts, they stll show-as well in the sckness a the mortality returns-an undue proportion of those unwholesome influences whEich act so severely on a city lIfe; but this will be better seen when we examine the death-rate of the young, and the nature of the diseases which have caused it.
			"In the course of theyearthemortalityof children unader 15 years of age has been greater than suual-it has risen from a general average of 1,351 to 1,408; and the increase has been chiefly among children of less than five years of age. These indeed have died to the number of 1,230, instead of 1,182. Altogether it amounts to a little more than 42 per cent. of all the deaths. In the metropolisgeneraUy the pro. portion is somewhat less than 41 per cent. ; and in all Eng. Saud, where the proportion of infants is much larger than in the city, it is but 42. I have no means of determining very accurately the death-rate of children in the city, for I have no knowledge of the number living; but if we take the number (13,663) which was given at the last census, and which is rather more than a tenth of tho whole popula- tIon, it wiil appear that the death-rate of children under five years of age has been a little moro than 90 in the 1,000 ; in the rest of London it Is but 77, in all England it is about 68, and in the healthy districts of the country it is only 40.
			"Again, the mortality of children in the first year of their age has been very severe, for It has amounted to nearly one-fifth of aU the births; in fact, out of 3,260 ohildren born in the year, 608 have died. This is somewhat more than the average (3,501 and 574) for the last 10 years, and It amounts to nearly 19 per cent. of the infant life; in the Eastern and Western divisions of the city it has reached to 22 per cent., whereas in the rest of London, as in aU England, it is only from 15 to 15-5 per cent.
			"At more advanced periods of life the death-rate dimi- nishes, and the returns are more favourable. They are far better,indeed than elsewhere, for at from 15 to35 years of age the mortality is greatly below the average for the whole country. In the first decennial period It amounts to only 51 pera,000, and inthesecond to 7 3; the ratesin England forthe corresponding periods being 8-4 and 10 4. After this, how- ever, they atain decline and from the ages of 35 to 45 they amount to 145 per 1,000l; from 45 to 55, to 191; and fro
			55 to 65, to 35-5,-the rates in England fIor those periods being but 13, 17-6, and 30-. It Is manifest, therefore, that the greatest strain upon a city life is dering childhood and Loature age.
			deLt us now examine the distribution of the deaths amongdo the the 2,911 deaths in the year 1,509 were males, and 1,402 females. These are In the proportlon of 1,075 of the former to 1,000 of the latter; in the rest of L6ondon it is only as 1,028 to 1,000, and in all England it is 1,033. At the ages of from 15 to 45 the city proportion of deaths is as 1,180 males to 1,000 females; in the whole of
			ondon it is hot 1c10s to 1,000, and in England only 933. In the 20 years which follow (from 45 to 65) the males of the city die at the rate of 1,280 for every 1,000 females. In
			London, at these ages, the proportion is 1,077, and in Enugland 1,037; and lastly, at 65 and upwards the male deaths in the city are oniy 650 to the 1,000 femaleso while in London they are 752, and in England 88S. lt thus appears that there is an undueproporton of males,upon the death-roll, and that it swells the mortality at every age up to 65. In London the excess is arrested at 55, and in
			fengland it stops at 15. to rise again at from 45 to 65. The maximum mortality of males in the city is at from 35 to 65
			and then it reaches to a proportion of about 1,400 males to 1,000 females. In England the maximum i6 from 55 to 65, and it never exceeds 1,087 to the 1,000 females.
			"Lastly. If wo look at the mean age at death in the city the results are equally significant. In all England the expectancy of 3amans life at 20 is tof60years, in thecdty t is only to 51-5. At tho age of 45 the expectancy of life in England is to 68-3, but in the city it is only to 62; and at 65 years of age a man in the rest of England might expect to live to 76, whereas in the city he will reach to only 7 3, The mean lifetime of adult females in England is only about one year more than that of males, but in tho city it is, at different periods of life, from four to aix years greater, show- ing that theunwholesomelulluences operate mostoeverely On the males; indeed, the conclusion from all this is that the clreumatances of a city life are peculiarly trying, for they increase the death-rate from a normal standard of about 17 in the 1,000 to nearly 23; they double the mortality of the infant population, and shorten the period of adult life fro m an average age of 60 to 51. -
			L )alar, however, as tnls picture may seem to be, it Is far llghter than It once was, and is brighter than that which is stilt dravwn of the chief towns of England and the large cities of Earope. Ten years ago the annual mortalLtv of the city was rarely less than 25 In the 1,000, and we are told by the Registrar-General that the death-rate of our largo towns at the present time is little short of 26 in the 1,000. Our present condition is 19 per cent, better than that, and we owe it to the sanitary labours of the last ten years. Even five years ago the average mortality In the city Ws as high as 3,190 in the year; but in the course of the last fonr years, stnce the fruits of those labours have begun to ripen, the number has fallen to an average of 2,902, and It is no small thing to have brought about the saving of nearly 300 Lives Ln the year, and that, too, In the mfitdst of difficulties of no ordinary character. The chief towns of England, vith their high mortality, are not subject as va are to the unw,holesome influences of a eexcessive over-crnwding. Here the inhabitants aro so thronged to- gether that from 131 to 291 must find room upon an acre. No such condition of things exists in the large towns of England; for the density of their population Is rarely above 50 on tho acre, and yet their mortality ranges from 24 to 36 in the 1,000. We have reason, therefore, for con- gratulation that the sanitary state of the city is as good as it is, and that the untoward circumstances which commerce and industry have forced upon us aore kept so largely in check.
			"In Table IV. of the Appendix the chief causes of death are classified, and the returns are compared vwth thoes of the last four years, daring which time the particular causes have been duly registered. Yon will notlice that the deaths from violence have fallen from an average of 163 to 15, and those from bronchitis and pneumonia fzom 521 to 457. Tubercular diseases have also diminsed from a general average of 647 too 3; phthiss has falLen from 372 to 342; tahe3 and eerofula from 179 to 153;* and hydra. rephaLus from 96 to 88. But there ore ether diseases whEich rsve advanced. Teething and the convulsions of Infancy hb,vs risen from an average of 164 to 193; and the cymutic' exssQf afgiteusn ha~ve ingRejsgd aro oa2 average of,620 1,
			665. his has beencaused by the general p?baleuce of eruptive disorders,-measles, for exgaple, have rlsC from 68 to 88, smallpox from 27 to 47, and scarlet fever from 110 to 17Afi7. The zymotio affectionsr of the throat as cronp, whoopIng-cough, and diphtheria, have likewise'been un- usnally fatal, in the proportion of 173 to 149. But the speoslu diseases of putridity, ofilth, and of over-crowding have been notably diminished; continued fever3 have faUen from an average of 121 to 107; alvine-flux from 45 to 31; and eryaIpelas from 22 to 10. The pathogenic tests, therefore, of the sanitary condition of this citv have n.t failed to shovw a marked Improvement in the public health; and it would be still more marked if the tests were applied to the return3 of a dozen years ego, for then the deaths from fever were rarely less than 160 in the year, and those from alvine-flux were not often below 100. I refrain from making any larga comparison of the moriality from these diseases in the city with that of England, but I may remark that fever and alvine-flux are les prevalent here than In the whole country; for while Avith us the former is fatal to only 1 In 1214 of the population, and contributes but 36 per 1,000 of aU the deaths, in England It Is fatal to 21 in 1,136, and contributeo about 41 per 1,000. Alvine-flux with us is fatal to only 1 In1,150, and makes but 38 per 1,000 of the deaths, but in all England it annually kills 1 in 1,026 of the people, and furnishes about 45 per 1,000 of the deaths. Phthisls also is less prevalent as a case of death in the city dis- tricts, but tabes and scrofula-the consumption of infancy- are far more so. AUl of which go to show that the great influences which are at work in shortening a city life are those whiob checek the healthy nourishment of the body, and yet hurry forward tho movement of the vital powers. These influences are remote as well as imnmediate in theIr action; for not only do they at once produce a rich harvest of death, but they scatter the seeds for fature growth. In fact, the conditions wvhioh tend to enfeeble the parent are per- petuated in the child, and the fature generation becomes less able to bear up against the noxious influences which may havo only weakened their progenitors. Something definite is wanted to meet these conditions, for they are in- dependent of what is thought to be the common and pre- ventable causes of disease. Hitherto our attention has been directed to what may be called the self-evident sources of disorder-as the crowding together of human beings, the collection of putrid refuse, and the insufficient supply of water; but nothing has been thought of the more latent in- fluences-as those of habit, and ocoupation, and poverty, and many domestio iUs, the effects of which are quite as seraons as those which come from filth and the action of zymosi; indeed, the deaths from diseases of growth and constitutional development are far more numerous than those of the pre- ventable claws, as they are commonly called; and the time is not far off when it will be thought necessary for the ex- tensionl of sanitary science beyond the domain of filth.
			" The meteorology of the year, which is shown in the 5th table of the Appendix, has been folly discussed In the [quarterly reports, and I have only to addthat 7,233 In- spections of bosses have been made in the course of the year, of which 803 were of the common lodging-houses, and that 035 orders have been Issued for sanitary improvement in various particulars. The details of all this are shown in the last table of the Appendix.

			SUD1JBN DEATH OF CAPTAIN LEICESTE R
			VRRNON, M.P. i
			We regret to have to record the death of this gallant gentleman, which took place suddenly on Saturday at his residence, 51, Great Oumberland-street, Hyde Park. Cap- tain Vernon left the Carlton Club in his carrlage at about 4 o'clook in the afternoon in his usual health and spirits. Accompanied by a friend, ho drove up St. Jamess- street, about the middle of which his horses became res- tive, when he got out of his carriage to ascertain the cause of the disturbance. In struggling with the horses he fell, but soon recovered himself, and proceeded calmly to direct that his horses and carriage should bo taken to some livery stables In the nelghbourhood, whither ho himself followed them on foot. He then, asserting, as indeed appeared to be the fact, that he was perfectly uninjured, walked to the top of St. James's-street, and got into a cab, giving orders that he might be driven to his resi- dence. At that time he complained of a slight pain in his chest, but still teemed to be in his usual spirits. On reach. ing the middle of Regent-street he made further com- plaints of being unwell, and upon his friend's suggest. ing that he should go to some medical man he requested that he might rather be driven home. On reaching his honse medical advlce was immediately summoned, but before it could arrlve Captain Vernon had breathed his last. The cause of death is ascertained to have been internal hemorrhage, produced by the rupture of a bloodve:sel. Captain Vernon was one of the members for the county of Berks, and was an active and able member of the House of Commons. By his death a large number of friends, both personal and political, have sustained a severe loss, while the extent of the suffering which his family undergo can be estimated only by the awful suddenness of the calamitv itsalf.

			RIPRESENT ATION OrF HARnuICH-The aspect of affairs in conorexion with the Impending election for Har- wich has sot undergone much change since the subject was last noticed in The Times. The three Liberal candi- dates-Mr. Brett, Mr. Thousson, and Mr. Montagu Cham- bers-appear to be all determined to go to the poll. Mr. Brett has issued an address to the electors, in which he states that " whether opposed by Mr. Thomson, or more gratofnly with his final aid," it is his positive determina- tion to press his claims to the end. Simultaneously with the publication of Mtr. Brett's address Mr. Thomson held a meeting of his snppo:ters, and it Is quitepossible that the mere the matter is discussed the more difficult it1will become to adjust the claims of the contending parties. Mr. Montage Chambers, who has stood as far as possible aloof from the strife of the little factions which divide the borongh, is ex- pected down again in a day or two. Meantime the Con- servatives chuiekle over the dissensions in the Liberal in. terest, and look sanguinely forward to the return of their c-andidate, the Hon. H. T. Rkowley.

			inun the best means of secouring an additional member for Salford. Mr. H. [Bawson moved a resolution approving Mr. Bazley's notice of motion in the House of Commons
			and hIr. Massey, MP. forthe borough, said the subject was one in which he entirely acquiesced, because it was one so jst and reasonable, and he had reason to beleve that the Government were net unfriendly to the object sought to bo obtained, their only fear being that If they admitted this claim It would open a wide door to similar applications which might endanger the progress of the BilL Independently of tbat consideration, the great Importance of the interests which the memberfor this borough represented enitled it to expect a double represen- tation in the House of Commons. He could only say that he should be desirous of acting in harmony with the views of the inhabitants of Salford in furthering this object; but at the same time he must be allowed seone discretion, as a member of Parliament, in tho course which he might take with regard to this borough. The mode of proceeding which suggested Itself to him, but which would not be proper for him to enter further into at that moment, because it was necessary to confer with others who are interested in the same object before ho com- mitted himself to any scheme which might be misinter- preted, and which might possibly leadto a misimpression as to the general object he had in view-would, he thought, materially facilitate the promotion of a good measure of reform, and also greatly relieve the Government of the very difficulties under which they were nOW labouring with regard to this particular proposition. Mr. Bazley, MY., and llr. Tnurnr, M1.P, promised support to the objects of the meeting, and it was determnbed to maeafrtthar appeal to Govern nt. - -

			FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. ,
			FRANCE.
			(A portfon of the followlng appearad in our second Vdiftion of Satuxday :-1
			(FROM OUR OWN COBRESPONDBT.)
			PARIS, FRIDMA, APRIL 13, fi .'s=
			A private letter from Naples, dated the 6th Lant. (Good Friday), mentions as follows:-
			"I am not aware that the Pope's bull has done mach harm hitherto emcept to those who have launched the thu- derbolt; it will probably recol on themselves, and may be followed by a religlous Echism. The clergy in Italy have advanced too Car on the popular aide; they cannot recede. As f-sr (the religious commanitles, the friars, blue, black, and gray, are alway, and ever have been, led along with the crowd. In the army the bull wil only hasten the withdrawal of those officers who belong to the annexed provinces. Of this disposl'ion to retire there is little doubt
			and it may be questioned whether 1amorlclde, with all his energy, wlll succeed in checklng the general tendency.1
			" Yesterday took place a most curious and Interesting pro. cesion. For the first time, I believe, since 1S48, the Court sallied forth in state to visit 'he churches. The young Queen was in full dress, with a largo train of black velvet, and a drews covered with black lace, and wearing on] her head tho Spanish mantilla. She -walked by the side of Hs Majesty, preceded by the chief officers attached to the Royal service, civilians and military, all in full costume; a Lurge display of the body guard, and uniforms of every rashion; the gay pages In their Spanish attire; and all the ladles of tho Court following, close in attendance, with their black velvet trains, In honour of the day, but with coloured ribands or flowers In their hair, In order tomark the absence of Court mornming. It reaUly was a gorgeous sight. The cort6gc Issued from the Palace on the square, followed by a certain number of old-fashioned sedan chairs, which were carried along in reserve for the Queen and Princesses in case of fatigue. The whole proceseion, describing a seml- circular curve, moved along one side of the square up to the Church of San Ferdinando, where the people subsequently had a sight of the decoration of the chief altarplece. It was a transparent painting, a copy of Raffael's magnificent Transfiguration, very well lighted up from behind, and pro- ducing a fine effect.
			" There was, of course, a large concourse of people on the Place, but not half so many as one mlght have expected on such an occadon. There was not one] cheer, nor did the bystanders take off their hats as the Royal cartge passed, with the exception of the occupants of some of the balco- nies. Thu Royal pairlooked sad enough; it might have been ia honour of the day, bat the news from Sicily that morning ws surely of a nature sufficiently depresdng.
			"This morning has brought additional Informatlon. There appears to be a general rising, and the fighting has commenced In right earnest. Then, again, the monks are supposed to go with the popular feeling. The rioters having made their way into a convent adjoining the town (Palermo), Shey were followed by the military, who set fire to the house, pillaged the church, and carried away as prisoners a number of the friars. Somo, indeed, were killed, fighting, It Is said. It is stated that there vws an understanding be- tween the townsmen and the country people. The town, at any rate, Is in a state of siege. The bakers have stopped, or been compelled to stop, baling; aU access to the town being denied, the inhabitants were in fear of being left without provisions. This morning three or four vessels carry. Ing troops and ammunition were despatched hence at early dawn. It is supposed that previous to the firing certain Incendlary proclamations were in clrculation, emanating from the msual quarter, and setting forth .he praises of the Subalpino demigod. This, howover, I give as a rumour, for the truth of which I do not vouch.
			" Amid this stirring and ominous intelligence I could not help belngamused by the account of the chivalrous enterprise of the SpanIsh Pretender. We all supposed he had made his peace some months ago (it was Don Sebastlan, the cousin of the Count do hMontemolln, who recognized Queen Isabella, and:tendered hi3 allegiance to her Government), and, as you know, as travelling on the continent. He wan expected back, as his arrival at Trleste was announced here during the winter. What a time to seleoct,-JUst when his Royal cousin's popularity must be shining brilliantly under the trophies of the Mauritanlan campaign ! It was announced yesterday by a telegram received at the Spanish Legation here that this prodigious blunder has reaUy been committed. A traitor was even found among the Generals, who volun- leeredhis servlces on the occasion. The soldiers were, how- ever, true to their colours, and as soon as they understood what was plotting around them they would have nothing to say to it; but I take it for granted you know all about the matter already.
			" Wlth regard to the Sicilan business some curious de. tails are given. The rlsing was expected by the police, who took advantage of the information, and it is said commenced by firing at inoffensive and peaceable residents, who were remaining quietly at home. A femalo servant, in the act of shutting the windows, received a baU in the chest. Fo- reigners and bankers have hastened away from the scene of contest.
			" Cardinal Antonelli is determined to make a clearance for the French General. He is arresting everybody. No ablebodi^d citizen feels secure."
			General Lamoriciare's letters from Rome con- tinue to speak favourably of the state and pro- spects of the Pontificel army. It is said he is of opinion that the Gendarmerie, who form a corps of 4,000 men, are pretty nearly, if not fuUy, equal to the French troops of the same arm. The officers of the artillery are also spoken of highly, and the line will, in a short time,with alittle drill and discipline, their pay punctually given to them, their food good and sufficient, and their comforts generally cared for, turn out as efficient as any other troops. With respect to the professed rioters, the General says that before he arrived at Rome they could be had for 30 sous a-head; since his arrival the price has in- creased to 3i francs.
			A French gentleman, formerly in diplomacy, and who knows Italy well is now at Rome, visiting the hospitals and other beneficent institutions, with a view to introducing reforms. He is not deputed by the French Government, but has volunteered his services.
			It is thoughs that other superior officers on the retired list of the French army will follow the example of General Lamoriciere, and enter the ser- vice of the Fope.
			From Spain there is nothing new. The Madrid journasl that announced the capture of Count de Montemelin and his brother nowsaythat the Govern- mnent is maLing every effort to catch them. It is as I expected. Such prisoners were an embarrassment to the Government. The Queen could hardly allow her cousins to be shot, and doubtless they have been allowed to escape. Another leader is said to have a]rcady done so, and may now be in England. It would, however, be too harsh to shoot that very foolish person Ortega, who was but an instrument, while tho principals who seduced him are allowed to escape. Ortega has no influence, and never had, in the Spanish army; he i3 far from being a dan- gerous man when no authority is intrusted to him. it is true that there is this aggravation in his case, that he deserted his post, and tried to seduce men under his command to re- bellion. But the Spanish Government is strono enough to be merciful, and it should not be too strict. Let General O'Donnell look up the lists of his acquaintances for the last fewv years and try whether any one he knows has ever begun or joined in a pron'inrciamicnio in similar circumstances. I suppose it makes no dilorernce in principle that some *ave succeeded and others have failed. The Spanish Government, however, can afford to be merciful, nnd it ought.
			Allusion having been made during yesterday's debate in the Corps Legislatif, by, I believe, AI. Jules Favre, to the words addressed by the Em- peror Napoleon (then President of the Republic) to Abd-el-Kader, on His MIajesty's spontaneous libera- tion of the African chief in 1852, it may be as well to give the words exactly. They are as follows:-
			*- Abd-el-Kader, I come to announce your liberation. Yoa shall be conducted to Broussa, in the States of the Sultan, the momeut the necessary preparations are com- pleaed, and you shaU receive from the French Government an allowance becoming your former ranlk
			" For a long time, is you are awore, your captivity cansed mo serious pain, for it incessantly reminded me that the .Government which preceded me did not keep tho engage- ments it entered ntro with an unfortunate enemy; and In my eyes nothing is more humiliating for the Government of a great nation than to undervalue Its force so far as to
			saU in its promises. Generosity Is ever tho best counsellor, and I am convinced that your sojourn in Turkey will not disturb the tranquillity of our possessions In Africa.
			Y4 your religion, like ours, teaches submisson to the de- .ews of Providence. If France Is mistress of Algeria, it is because God has willed it, and the nation will never give .3p this conquest.
			Ys You have been the enemy of France, but I do not the less render jusi3ce to your courage, to yonr character, to yoUr resignation in misfortune; wherefore, I deem it a point of honour to put an end to your captivity, having the utmost faith in Your word."-(Euvcrs du Raveon rrII., voL 3, p. 345.
			The date of this address is the 16th of October, 1852, geven days after the speech at Bordeaux,
			c "L'Empire c'ese la paiz," which was deliveredon the 9th of the same month. Abd-el-Kader has certainly e,pt his promise.
			The Patrie is a lHttle angry at having to promul- gate its communique from the Home-office. It eats itS leek, to be sure, but not with better grace than Pistol. " I eat, and eke I swear." The Patrie can- not well sweaf' at the Minister of the Interior, but it does the second beat thing,-it " sweas" at The Times. You may have no objection to be a con- ductor to the Patrie's lightning, but you will be sur- prised, or rather amused, to learn that the said comn- mrunregewas meant for you as wel as forit. "Our communiqul," the Patrie says, " is not so foreign to it (The lmes) as it supposes; it has a good share of it."
			Besides these incidental remarksE, the Pacrie de- vOtes an entire article to the .ubject. This article is rathera fair specimen of the style called the (7ar- magnole, Eo much cultivated by the newspaper and pamphlet writers of the first Revolution, and which pervaded nearly the whole current literature of the period. The Patrie vehemently denies that it Is
			"inspired" by the Neapolitan Legation, or by any one; it has its information from " honourable sources," including, I presume, that relating to the Carliat insurrection being got up by England. It does not entirely approve the institutions " and certain practices of the Neapolitan Government," but, eeeing that "1 false news of every kind" was clrculatedlby The Time-s against it, the Patric tried to findout themotive ; that motive it discovered, and it is nothing less than the " dismemberment of the Two Sicilies." Hence your anger against the Patrie, "' which The Times cannot pardon for having eeen so clearly through it ;" for " The Times has no sympathy for a clearsighted policy."
			The Patrie having thus brought home to vou a project for &amp;Lqrnaembering the Sicilies, in commer- cial phrase, " at 'ahort date" (rourte echeance), evi- dently thinks that the glory of the discovery amply compensates for the commnuniqug. While the Patrie was in the vein, it ought to have dispeUled the popular belief or error to which I alluded yester- day, touching the Press Department of the Minister of the Interior. This, however, may yet come.
			Ihave received the following letter from Bucha- rest. datecd the 4th inst. --
			"Great uneertainty still prevails with respect to the loan, to which we attach great importance. The Govermuent asserts that it is concluded, and annoances the receipt of letters from M. Place, the French Consul at Jassy, now acting as Prince Couza's agent at Paris, stating that the affair has been happ�1y settled. So much the better, but private letters from Paris inform us that the Turkish Am- bassador has made a strong opposition to any attempt of the Moldo-Walachian Government to raise money on national security. We are Informed that the loan conse- qlaently could not be concluded, and the assertion of the Ministry smrprises us; bat I say again so much the better if it succeed. The Government has so much want of the money in order not to lose all authority in the country, that In my conviction It Is tho sole reason why it endeavours to con- ciliate the Chamber, without which the loan cannot be rati- fied. Therefore yon may expect a new dissolution as soon as the money is prooured, but if such an event should take place you may likewise expect to see a new Chamber elected even more hostile to Prince Couza than the present. The friends of the Prince speak of a journey which he proposes to take to Constantinople towards the middle of next month; and the question is, 'W hat is he going to do at Constantlnople P The Duke do Brabant has loft for Con- stantinople, through Giurgevo and Galatz. It is unfortu- nate for us that he has seen only the least fine part of onr country, and cannot therefore form a correct jadgment of it. He has shown himself to be atn accurate ob- server, for, after inspectLug a WaUachian regiment, he remarked that there were more officers attached to it than soldiers. That Is perfectly true, particularly in Moldavia, where the militla is much interior to that of Wallachia. On entering the town of Jassy one meets so many officers that one would think the garrison consisted of 30,000 men. The passage of the Duke de Brabant pro-] duced a great sensation here, inasmuch as it was reported he came to study the country, because his brother, the Count de Flandre, may one day be caUed on to reign over the PrincipaUitles,which a French diplomatist caUed the Belgium Iul the Danube."
			The following paragraph appears at the head of Bulier's correspondence:-
			" The Swiss question is still the subject of negotiation. An amicable conclusion is more than probable, but what has been published on the subject is purely hypothetIcaL It is scarcely worth remarking that the strip of land to be neutralized round the LAke of Geneva is an invention of the Belgian journals. For somo time past the Brussels press has devoted Itself very inconsiderately to the study of geography. It has not, however, made much progrezs, for it Is as little versed in Malte-Brun as In PEuffendorf or Grotlus."1
			Al. Autran, Commissary-General of Mlarine at Toulon, has left that port for Nice, charged with a special mission by the Minister of Marine. c
			The last accounts received from Nice announce that the Italian party in Savoy and in the county of Nice are using every exertion to prevent the peasants from voting on the annexation to France. Among other reports circulated for that purpose it is asserted that all the communes on the west slopes of the Alps are to remain with the King of Sar- dinia. Nothing can be more absurd, inasmuch as the entire of Savoy has been ceded to France.
			A French paper manufacturer has invented a new pack of playing cards; each card represents some remarkable fact connected with the history of Napoleon I. or of Napoleon III. All the figures are of the same period, the costume is perfect, and remarkable for the execution and the briliancy of the colours. The pack of cards is caUed Carl esde VEre Impe'riae. In place of kings there are four emperors, including the Prince Imperial; four em- presses, includling the Empress-Mother; and in plae of knaves, four Bonapartes, brothers of Napoleon L For aces there are four islands, viz., Martinique, where the Empress Josephine was born, the island of St. Croix, Elba, and St. Hielena.
			TPhe following letter from Mlarseilles, of the 10th inst., gives some additional particulars with respect to the late attem pt of the Counut de Montemolinl to revolutionize Spain:
			"The recent attempt of General Ortega has given risa to an inquiry on the part of the authorities here, which has clearly established that our shipowners had no concern whatever in the expedition, the responsibility for which at first appeared to fall partly on the persons who had hired the Htveaune steamer. This vessel had been chartered for a month, at the price of 15,000f. Coals to the amount of 15,000f. were to be purchased, and the Fraissinet Company was to receive notioe as to the continued hiring of the ship a fortiglht before the expiry of the term assigned. Onerous as these terms appear, they were Immediately accepted by the hi-ers, to the great surprlse of the owners, who were
			stonished to see them admitted with so little hesitation. The money was paid down at once. The supercargo of the vessel was sent to ask whether it would be possible to sall on any given day and at any hour. He was informed that as aU the formalities had been duly attended to, the vessel might go to sea at any hour of the day or night, provided the captain was advised In time. On the 24th of March it was asked whether the passengers could then be taken, and anaffirmnativeaniswerbeinggtven,during thenight of the 25th the captain of theHuveatunewas directed to get up his steam. At 5 In the morning the vessel left the port of the Joliette with five passengers, three of whom had French passports, and of the otheitwo, onehad an Engllsh one, and the other a Perma one. These indviduas, who were evidently persons of high rank, had been writed for at Marseilles by a person recently arrlved from Paris. There Is reason to think that General Elio, Cabrera's brother-In-law, and perhaps also the Count de Montemolin, were two of these unknown per. sonages. On the 25th, the weather being rough, the vessel
			3wa compelled to change her course, and made for Cette, where the sapercargo, under the pretext of sea-sickness, transferred all his powers to a Spanish refugee named Casanova. The Haveaune then steered for the Balearic Isles, instead of going direct to Africa to fetch oxen, as had been pretended. At Majorca the vessel was placed at the disposal of General Ortega, who sent it to San Carlos de la Bapita. It was expected that the vessel would be selzed, but it was not, as the captain has addressed a telegraphic despatch to his owners, stating that he was proceeding to Oran, after conveying troops from Tortoss to Valencia for the Spanish Government. The captain most probably proved that he had acted with perfect good faith, whlch would ex- plain why It was thought proper to make use of his ship at a critical moment."

			SATURDAY, Aprac 14, 6 P.n.
			The Minister of War has commisqioned the chief of the Staffof the corps Xarmge under the command of AMarshal Canrobert to inspect the fort of Rausses, on the frontiers of Switzerland.
			The Minister of Marine has published a rircnlar, authorizing young men of the class of 1859, residing on the sea coast, ':J contract voluntary engagements to serve in the navy for seven years. In order to facilitate the entrance into the service of a greater number of these young conscripts the Minister has reduced the height required for admission from 1 metre 65 centimetres to 1 metre 63 centimetres.
			Great activity is observable in the port of Toulon, and likewise at Marseilles. It has been observed in the latter town that for some time past tbo depar- ture of Imperial couriers for Constantinople, bear- ing despatches, and their return thence have been incessant.
			It is announced that the Marquim de Lavalette, appointed Ambassador to the Sublime Porte in place of ML Thouvenel, will embark at Marseilles on the 26th for Constantinople. The Baron Charles de Chassiron has arrived in Paris -onom a mission to China and Japan.
			The Messager de Nice says:
			" The port of Vllafranca, wlhen given up by Russia, Is destined to become one of the stations of the French fleet in the Mediterranean, and yards for building and repairing merchant shlps are to be establshed there.
			" Yesterday morning tho cures of all the parisbes of the town walted on Senator Pletri to express to him the satisfaction they felt at the aunexation of the ocsnty to France, and protested their devotedness to the Emperor of the French. M. Pletri, in his turn, assured them of tho Interest which His Majesty felt for Nice, and told them that the stop they had taken should be duly made known to his Sovereign. Soon after the cures had left, the chapter of the cathedral sent to M. Pleti a deputation, composed of the Chevalier de Cessolle, Chevalier Lanteri, and the Tbeologian Mruaux, to request ihim to lay at the feet of the Emperor the expresslon of their homage and devotedness."
			The Gazefte du M1idi publishes an address Bent to the Emperor by the inhabitants of Monton and Rloquebrune, in Monaco, praying that they may be again placed nuder the govorrnsent of their rightful prince, Charles 1II., from wYhom, they declare, they hlave been illegally separated since 15848. They ask at the same time to be placed under the protectorate of France.
			I have received the following letter
			"FESTH, ArIL 7.
			"Protimann, the Austrian Police Diroetor in this dty, seems to do all he can to exasperate the Hungarlan popula. tion. At the verymomentat which everybody, high and low, is mourning the death of young Fornyak, which was occa- sioned by the Austrian police, he (Prottmann) outrages the publc sentiment and forgets the regard due to the dead by arrestng Captain Fornyak, the victim,'s brother, and Lieutenant Vezerle, his cousin! The reason why the first has been thrust into gaol Is that when Prottman asked him, in order to prevent a crowd, to cause the funeral of his brother to take place earlier than announced, he answered, 'I will not do it ! When my poor brother lived ho was in your hands, and now that you have kiDled him he Is in mine ! I wil not baulk the peoplo of tho sad satisfaction of paying honour to the murdered victim of their cause !' The pretext of tho arrest of Vezerle was, that vhen the coffin of the young man was lowered into the grave, he cried, ' Fornyak, my friends, died for the country; long live Hungary in-a cry which was repeated with enthusiasm by the multitude p*resent. To make these arrests more offensive, thoy were effected immediately on the return of the two officers from the funeral l
			" The new Austrian loan is a failure, not only In this eountry, but in the rest of the empire. Only some 33,000,000 dorins out of the 200,000,000 florlnsrequired have been eubscribed; and though the time for receiving subscriptions has been prolonged to the 14th, there Is no likelhood that the amount obtained will exceed 50,000,000 florins. The AiustrLan Finance Minister tal;es this check very phllosophically; and ho is wise, for as the loan, even if subscribed to the uttermost farthing, would not have saved Austria from the bankruptcy wlth which she has long been threatened, so the failure of it will not hasten very materiaUy the catastrophe. The Minister has ordered the bonds of the loan not stbscribed to be handed over to the Bank of Vienna, ' in payment of the Government debt.' That Is indeed a ' new way of paying old debts.' The ostensible object for which the loan was to be raised was to restore to the bank the 133,000,000 florls which It advanced the Government during the warin Italy; but instead of cash the Bank gets paper. In plain English, it exchanges paper for paper, end that is clled 'paying' in Austria. It is true, however, that the new bonds nominaly bear 5 pei cent. Interest, whereas the Bank has hitherto only been promised 2l.
			" A dngulr Instance of the extreme distrust with which the Austrian Government is regarded in this country has jugt occurred. The promoters of tho recent concert for the benefit of the famishing Crosts have deolined to hand over the sum raised jsome 6001. English) to the Government for transmission to Croatia, and have charged a deputation, consisting of Count Karolyi, Count Kaglevich, Count Festities, and Baron Podmanlczky, to carry the money to the province and to distribute it themselves. The reason of this Is, that people know here, from sad experience, that money transmitted for any purpose through a Government office becomes wofully diminished cn route."

			SARDINIAN PARLIAMENT.
			(pmom OUR OWN CORREMNDn'-T
			TURIN, APRIL 11.
			Both Houses sat to-day. The Senate, under the presidency of the Marquis Cesare'Alfieri di Sostegno, was to "constitute itself by the 'verification of powers,'" and the choice of the subaltern officers of the President's board-the secretaries and ques- tors. Although the Senators are appointed for life by the King, "the fountain of all honour, who can do no wrong," yet they must undergo some inquiry at the time of their nomination, to see that the King'a choice has fallen on persons qualified by their age, their income, their rank as public func- tionaries, or their service in the Lower House for a certain number of years, or a series of various Par- liaments, as the law directs.
			The President of the Senate is appointed by the King, who could not, in this instance, have better consulted the public suffrage than by confirmig in the chair the Marquis Xifieri, the very highest gentleman in the country, whether we look to birth, rank, mental attainments, or generous prindi. ples. The Vice-Presidents, whose number wm for- merly only two, but has here, as in tho Lower House, been raised to four since the late expan. sion of the boundaries of the realm, are also chosen by the King; and the King's choice fell this year so as to dlstribute the kRoya favour eqcually auniqg al
			the newly-annexed provinces, by fixing, on Casati, a Lombard; Coccopan4, a Alodenese, Pasolini, of Romagna; and Ridolfi, of Tuscany. The secreta- ries and "questors," or administrators, masters of the ceremonies, and serjeant-at-arns of the House, are chosen by the senators themlselves.
			Trhe choice of the same f7mctionaries, six secre- taries and two questora, busied also the Lower C5hamber for the whole of to-day's sitting. Although the permanent President and Vice-PresIdentc are already in being, the senior Vice-Fresident Zanolini and his provisional office ke,pt their places, which they will only resign after the completion of the permanent offlce. The sin secertaries, resulting fom two successive votes, were Cavallini, with 151 votes; Galeotti, 130; Tenca, 123; Martineli, 112; Mischi, 101; Casarotto (on the second scrutiny), 152. The two questors were Valvassori, with 172 votes; Chiavarina, 151. The new Scggio, or presidency, will be installed to-morrow.
			At the opening of the sittingthePresident roaa a letter signed by very nearly all the Savoyard deputies, and even by those of Faucigny and Chablasi in which, i consideration of the vote which is eo soon to decide on their destinies, and "bring about, by a political bond, that union of their country to France which had already eter- nally been decreed by nature," they bog to be ex- cused from attending an assembly from which they would so soon have to part. The deputy Sineo observed that, as tho Chamber had no official communication with respect to the intended cession of Savoy, they could take no notico whatever of the letter of the deputies of Savoy, and would consider it as no7 aveu-e. The subject thus dropped.
			At the close of the sitting at a quarter-past 5 o'clock, the deputy from Nice, Laurenti Robandi, addressed the House in the name of his friend General Garibaldi, " unavoidably absent," as he said, " on private affairs." In the General's name he asked the President whether to-morrow, upon the permanent 8-eggio being duly installed, andc the House thus finaUy constituted, it would be allow- able to put to the Ministers that question on the subject of th cession of Nice to Francewhich the General had vainly endeavoured to address to Count Cavour on Friday last. The President of the Cham- ber returned an affirmative answer, and Count Cavour declared himself prepared to attend the House to-morrow and meet Garibaldi's question. Thus the gauntlet, with respect to this affair of Nice, was thrown down and picked up, and to-morrow will be a day of battle.
			We are now informed that, although tho vote -by universal suffrage for Savoy is appointed to take place on bbe 22d, at Nice the plebiscite is ordered for the 15th, allowing scarcely a week for drawing up the electoral lists, &amp;c. There is a rumour in circulation, which deserves but little credit, that Nice is to be neither French nor Italian, but isto be erected into a neutral principality in favour of Prince Napoleon (Jerome) and the Princess Clotilde.
			The Government here have expressed the highest disapprobation of Luboni's manifesto to theNizzards, to which I ailluded i.u my yesterday's letter.
			I hear from good authority that the Sardinian Mwinisters Will shortly publish all the correspondence occurring betweea the Pope and King Victor ;Emmanuel. From these interesting documents it will appear how strangely the meekness andforbear- ance of the warrior King contrasts with the arro- gance and insolence of the " Servant of Servants of Christ." Nor is it to be wondered at; it is the loser who usually loses his temper.
			The portfolio of Agriculture and Comraerce, which has been accepted by the Tuscan advocate Tommaso Corsi, had been previously offered to Ubaldino Peruzzi, also a Tuscan deputy, who de- clined it. Besides his numerous avocations, which bind Peruzzi to his native Florence, it is also possible that his independence of character unfitted him for office under a Prime Minister who exacts, perhaps, from his colleagues greater compliance than they may at all times feel disposed to yield.
			The Government here have received the most positive assurance that the French will quit Rome, and all the Roman territory, not excepting even Civita Vecchia, at a very early period. But when 1 For myself, seeing is believing.
			The Sicilian news, as they reach us here, describe the straggle between the Deople and the Royal troops as by no means at an end. The Royalists have the upper hand at Palermo; the country is in full insurrection, and more than 9,000 patriots are in arms in the central part of the island. Fresh troops are landndg almeost hourly from Naples.

			THE INSURRECTION IN SICILY
			(FROM OUR OWN CORRMSPONDMfT.)
			NAPLES, Annm 7.
			It is Holy week, and lls Majesty has been edi- fying the lieges by extraordinary acts of devotion. True that the Royal troops have been engaged in a death struggle with the " amatissimi Suddifi" of the "adorato Sovrano"in Sicily, as the phrases stillare, but so much the warmer waxes the devotion of Francis I. On Wednesday it was telegraphed and published that " evil-intentioned persons" had attacked the Royal troops, and on Holy Thursday the pious Sovereign actually walked on foot to visit the sepul- chres in five churches. While performing this notable act of devotion piles of ball were being taken down for shipment an an Easter offering to Sicily, close under the Palace windows. I watohed the operation, and marked the cannon which were put out for the same benevolent objects, and the numerous emp?oyis who were hurrying backwards and forwards preparing the 'work of death. The streets were guarded all this time by strong detach- ments of Rifles, the Royal Guard, gendarmerie, and police; and amid these proofs of affection and confidence the young King Francis If., scarcely before the termination of the first year of his reign, issued from his Palace to perform one of the most solemn acts of hisreligion. OnGoodFridaytheplain- tive notes of the Miserere ascended to Heaven from the Royal Palace, and mingled with the shrieks of the dying from the other side of the Straits. Bigotry, hypocrisy, and brutal oppression,-such are the signs by which is distinguished the Government that for some mysterious and inexplicable purposes God yet permits to misrule this garden of Europe! IT have told you that a revolution wan on the eve of breaking out in Sicily, for the Sicilians had themselves, according to their usual practice, announced it, and they never fail in their word. They could endure its no longer;* their suffer- ings, during the last 12 years especially, have been so great that sober men have rejected the reports of them, and yet they have not been exaggerated. I have been one of those who havo received and re- ported with great caution statements regarding tor- ture, for instance, and now I can no longer resist the evidence which has been given to me. The following ease has been given to me by a person highly in- formed and worthy of implicit credit, not an Italian: -A young man was arrested on suspicion of havino been an accomplice in the attack upon Maniscalchi
			who is described to me as having become a ferocious wild beast. On being imprisoned, the young man's two thumbs were tied together, and so he was left for four weeks. On the expiration of that term a sergeant on guard entered the prison, loosened his thumbs, gave him a kick in the ribs, and ordered him to " get out." On the yoang man's remon- strating, he was told he would be sent to the Lipari Isles if he did not leave the prison. I have other credi- ble cases by me, and hundreds reported which may be true, and I have seen and know enough to justify me in asserting almost any enormity. By the pollce these facts are called "pene" and "puni- gioni," and so they get over the difficulty of tor- ture. It is against a series of such systematic bar- barities that the Sicilians have again risen, as they gave notice they would fully two months since. The Government haspromised and deceived; has spurned all law; has arrested, imprisoned, exiled, and tortured until the victims have been lashed into fury. I do not ask, but demand firm faith in my statements; and in the interests of humanity and of the peace of Europe I ask whether some excuse cannot be found for Intervention to put a stop to such a state of things. Early in the week families arrive here on robte to Marseilles or else- where, some in exile, some in flight from danger or vengeance. The Viceroy bronght up the laiies of his family, as Palermo wan no longer a safe residence for them, and I was told some days ago that there would be a considerable emigration. On Wednesday night last the Government published a telegraphic despatch to the effect that "a a few ill- intentioned persons had dared to attack the Royal troops in Palermo, and had killed four soldiers sad three companions of arms. That the troops had taken possCSsion of the monastery of the Graneoia tin the Piazza 3Marina, almost in the centre of the capital), and that sOme armed bands which had appeared in t'he eighbourhood of tho capital had been destroyed. Tranquillity and order had been perfectly re-established." L'Qoaon
			believes the statement, as the extensive prepara- tions which were made immediately betray the greatest apprehenson on the part of the Govern- ment. There was a Council of State held on Wednes- day; present-Cassaro, Comitini, Carafa, Cassial, and Castelcicala, and in the night following the Viceroy left for Sicily, on board the Government stoamer the Aquila. From that time to this, though PassSion week, and a high holyday here, the people inl the arsenal have been working night man day. Every steamer has beenS put in reqnlsition,-the Ruggiiere -and the Fieramoscha whbich werer about to leave for Toulon to hodocked; the Archimede which was to be repaired here. The Veloce, which was in the dry dock, was ordered to be got readybyto-morrow. All the steamers in the immediate servlce of the King vere also put in course of preparation; and evon the large mercantile steamers the Pompeii, Vesuvis, and Capri, have been taken up by the Government. During the night of Thursday the railway to Castellamare waS kept open for the conveyance of troops, which were to be ghipped, some say at Castellamare, others at Salerno, probably at both places, as they were to be drawn from Capus, Maddaloni and Nocera. Now, in Sicily there is already a nominal force of 32,000 men-let us put it down at 24,000 effective; so that the preparations which are being made in- dicate the magnitude of the danger. While waiting for fresh information let me give yon one of those significantfactswhichtook place last week inPalermo. The Traviata was performed on Wednesday in last week, and the printm donna made her appearance on the stage decorated with the Italian tricolour. Of course she was received with the greatest enthu- siasm, but though the police surrounded the theatre they did not enter. The same scene was enacted on Thursday night; and on S;aturday night, being the last performance in Lent, a strong demonstra- tion was expected, and I believe that that night had been fixed upon for the con- moncement of the revolutiou. As much as 10 piastres were offered for a single place; but, during the day, the police gave notice that there would be no performance, aS the gasometerA was out of order. It appears that C3stelcicala returned unwviUingly to Sicily, and, while in Naples, entreated the King, if he w ould not make any change in the institutions of the country, at least that he would send a Royal Prince to hold out some promise for the future. The Majesty is said to have positively re- fused to do anything.
			The reports which I receive are so conflicting that it is extremely difficult to ascertain the truth, but I believe that the following is the best information which can be procured of recent events in Sicily. A despatch received by the King last Thursday, at S o'clock, says that the in- surgents had been all driven out of Palermo, and were enw route to Termini, near which they had cut the selegraph wires. From Termini to Messina all was said to be quiet. The troops are said to have fought well, and certain names are -mentioned; but it was stated that the struggleA had been most, bloody. At midday yester-4 day the Elettrico came in with letters &amp;onmPalermo. She was taken into the now port, and every precau tion taken to cut off all communication between the vessel and the population. Altogether there were about 100 persons on board, of xhom the majority w ere Sicilians, many of high rank, either exiled or 'lying from Pelermo, and these go on to Marseilles. In the course of the afternoon I managed to see two of the passengers, one Englishman and an American, one of whom reports as follows:-" I heard on Tuesdav night that the revolution would brealk out on the following morning, and about 5 a.m. on Wednes- day I was awoke by volleys of shots. On looking out of my window in the Trinacria, I saw a number of soldiers running down the streets, firing right and left at random, and t,'hen reloading. At a slight nolse they fired 20 shots at the Palazzo Petrulla, and shot a poor servant girl who was opening the bolt of a window; not far from the hotel I ob- served five men, apparently peasants, firlng at the soldiery, and I never saw more together ; but I did not go out early. By 9 o'clock I think all was over in Palermo. The fighting took place in several parts of the city, bu principally in and about the Monastery of the Grancia,in the Piazza della Marine. Indeed, according, to a preconerted signal, which was to be a musket-shot, the monks sounded the tocsin. One of the resident consuls heard the officer in command of a body of troops give the command to take and sack and pillage the building, and this was done. Three of the monks were bayoneted on the spot, and died directly after; another is said to be mortally wounded, and the rest are in prison." MIy informant further said," I. was walking later in the day and one of the soldiers came to -s IaAen with hnntv- whi,h
			he offered for sale. My friend bought a Greel work printed in 1605, and a novel of rather a prurienit character. He offered us besides a ruler. His knamsack was ful of various articles which he had plundered. My friend gave siX tarini for bU purchase. Al fighting was now over in Palermo, but in the afternoon and evening there was sharp work going on at Mronreale, for - saw a cart brought in full of wounded-he said,dead -soldiers. On Thursday morning,from the top of the house, I saw a Neapolitan frigate coast along towards Bagar, and fire broadsides for two hours on the town and neighbourhood, and a regiment of infantry was also sent dow;n there. Prince Castelcicala arrived at 3 p.m. on Thursday, and we aU went on board the Elettrico to leave for Naples, but waited for despatches until hali-past 8 o'clock. Whilo on board I distinctly heard firing in the country, at the back of the city, between M4urreale and Bagaria, and my impression is that they are fighting still and that the revolution wil extend. The loss must have been very great on either side, and Palermo, when I left, wore a sad appearance indeed. The shops were al shut, and a cordon of soldiers was drawn round the city." My other informant adds but little to this intelligence; indeed he was ca1 ronte for Girgetti when the revolt began. On the road he heard of the row, and met the people flying away from the city. On arriving near Palermo he was met by six cavalry soldiers, who forced him to ad- vance, but at length all of them accompanied him to the officer in command, and he was permitted to enter the city, which he did at 4 o'clock. His re- port is confirmatory of what I have already told you; and, on my asking him what was the appearance oi the city, he replied, "Imagine a Scotch Sunday; nothing could be more tiiste." I have omitted to state that my first informant said that arms were found in the monastery, and wooden guns, as he heard, lned with metal. I have had access, also, to many of the merchants' letters, and find them all more or less agreeing in what I have reported. Some indeed think that the revolution is virtually quelled, others are of opinion that it will spread rapidly. One letter says that four cannon were reported to have been taken by the in- surgents at Bajaria and the troops disarmed, and the writer deciares that the monks fought better than any of the Liberals, who showed the white feather. As usual, there seems to have been a traitor in the camp; the authorities got hold of the signal agreed upon, fired the "shot," and the tocsin was sounded prema- turely. The C.sar, 90 guns,' Captain Mfason, came in on Thursday last from Malta to replace the Orion, which will probably go home for repairs. An American frigate and a Russian frigate are also here. Vincenzo Larza, the eminent physician, and the no less distinguished patriot, died on Tuesday last. A deputy in 1843, he fled the country and was condemned to death in cotu,nacia; be returned in 1855, as even despotism needed the talents of the great physician.
			Here in Naples the same boasted tranquillity pre- vails, for to stir would involve useless bloodshed and certain death. The same system continues without any indication of a change; the Bourbons will never change. Gatti, a literary man wel k-nown at the British Legation,-in fact, in all the first circles of
			uaples, was sent into exile to Ischia last Mlonday, though my impression was that he left some days since. His wrists were bound in the prison, but thoenanacles taken off outside for a consideration. In Ischia he was compelled to take lodgingzs over the gendarmerie station. Arrested on the 3d of March, of course it is unnecessary to say that he has not been tried. But this and other similar cases are tri'des In comparison with vihat isg passing around us.
			O)n Tuesday, the 3d inst., his Royal Highnesss the Count of Syracuse seat in a " memorandum" to HiES MIajesty, urging concessions and a frank union with Piedmont. The Count said he would wait on His Majesty, if he desired, to offer ex- planations, but I have reason to believe that he has not been sent for. His Royal Highness, who has counselled and remonstrated till ho la wearied and hopeless, resolved on making this 'lst appeal to his Royal neDhew as a iustification
			DE himself. The passport of the Prince is kept ready, and hangs over him like t*le sword of Damocles Ajos3a walking about and declaring openly that such is the fact. I will send you the memo- randum by tho next po3t. At present it in impossible. Desnatches have been sent off to the'Governors of the North complaining of alleoed Intrigues on the part of France, and, pexhaps, of England, and asking them to guarantee the States of the King of tho Two Siclles. I have reason to believe, also, that special directions have been sent to the NeapDlitau Mnistera st Turin, Paris, Brus. sels, and London, to keep their Government at courant of what was going on in the countries in which they are residing. A suspicious-looking
			craft had appearad off MIartineiciro, ol the Roman �rontier, hearing a* tricoloulred flag; the Genera], in command of a brigado in that direc- tion, had sent his aide-de-camp to inquire into the affair, but he had not returned wvhen the letter of My informant left. The official journal of last night, after a few words on the Sicilan revolution, de- scribes the ceremony of Thursday last, and repre- sents the people as crowding to every point to admire the august couple,who, beaming with youth, beauty and majestic decorum, walked in procession, reading in every look the love of w;hich thiey are thel objects hearing in every direction the benedictions and prayers which rere raised to IHeaven for. their long prosperity; and in the long train of grovelling courtiers who have not the courage to remonstrate against the measures which they con- demn was Prince Torella. Prince Torella, who passed the night of the 2d of March in the Prisons of the Prefecture, and whoso brother, the Marchese Bella, is in exile, was in the gilded train of lackeys, sporting the key of office in his coattails. I mark the fact as significant of the degradation in which the nation is sunk- when one who bears the name of Liberal followed his Sovereign among the most oh- equious of his courtiers. UJgh ! it makes one's gorge rise at the thought of it. The Jourial
			f last night gazettes the names of 37 persons who have been aggrariati on the occasion of Easter. They are all mnen wvho have had their trial and been condemned, in October last, to 25 yearsin irons. I have not heard of one person of the many who have been chafing in prison or exile for years on political suspicion, without trial, who has been liberated. One may almost say that there is a premium offered by the Government for theft and murder. There were cries uttered last night in the Largo Mercatello of " Vitva Pakrmo," "1 Viva Italia," " Viva Vdtario E7nmawaide.." The shops were all shut in a moment, and the streets remained a desert. MIeantime large bodies of police and gendarmes made their ap- pearance. During the afternoon many persons were summoned to the Prefecture, as Baron Petti
			the Judge Bardare, and Coutresux, a musioseller- but they were al set at liberty. I am inormed that the submearine teleerah betreen Sicilr and thA c
			tinent has beenbroken, and Pellegiui, the Director of Telegraphs, left yesterday to superintend the repairs. Prince Comitini has been gazetted Minister for Sicilian Affairs, though, it is said, contrary to his will; and Filangieri, the hopeof England and Austria-who did nothing in 10 month:
			but secure his own interests, who was impcdifo half that time, and was lately dismissed by tho King- was sent for by Iis Majesty on Thursday, and obeyed the call, to superintend the work of blood int Sicily. It is to be observed that the OifcitalJournal, which on Wednesday night declared that the revo- lution vas put down, last night speaks of armed bands in the countrv, which might perhaps occasion annoyance only to the valiant soldiers.
			A5rm PosT-TmD.
			In addition to what I have already told you, I now communicate the statements of two of the foreign consuls resident in Palermo, and beg you to observe that the wholo of my Siclianintelligencea is derived from such sources, or from merchants' letters. The statements are to the effect that the fighting began outside the town at 4 o'clock in the morning, and was taken up at the monastery of the Gnancia, in the Piazza Mlarina, with sounding of bels. The monks fought like lions, and thrwa hand-grenades on the soldiers; but when the
			affair was over those who survived presented' themselves with a crucifix before them, ex- claiming, "PcrdoWdei!" The monastery, which I visited afterwards, presented a lamentable sight, for it had been pillaged and destroyed. The fighting continued in Palermo till 12 o'clock, and was still carried on in Monreale duringtthereat of the day and evening. On Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, when the letter was dated, the firing of cannon and musketry was seen and heard by the correspondents I quote towards Monreale. Two thousand armed men had been expected in from the countrv on Wednesdav evening. but did
			not make their appearance. A great many arrests had taken place in Palermo, and a great number had been Idlled. One of the writers thinks that the affair must go against the people, as the Government has so strong a force. Various reports are circulatiun about the Calabrias, Mes'ina, and Catania, but I abstain from communicating them, as I cannot rely upon them.
			Here great activity prevails in sending off pro- visions and ammunition. Three other mercantile steamers have been taken up by the Government, and have been bored for cannon. At Salerno 600 of the new foreign troops have been stationed, as the whole of that neighbourhood is in an ex- cited state. Prince Niscani, who came uD from Palermo yesterday, was arrested at 2 o'clock after midnight, with his chasseur and another Sicilian. Thus, as some people have informed you for a long *time, we go on charmingly in this kingdom, and the utmost tranquillity prevails.

			SWITZERLakID.
			(FROM OUR ON'l CORRESPONDENT.)
			GENEVA, ArrTL 12.
			Decidedly the fear entertained by the Liberal party in Switzerland, lest the great Powers who signed the treaty of 1815 should too warmly take up the cause of the Confederation and try to revive old political tradition, was exaggerated. Not only is thero no danger of a too energetic support of the claims of Switzerland, but, on the contrary, it becomes everydaycdearer that this latter has nothing to expect from that aide. The Powzers evidently think that the old cover w hich has hitherto, at least nominaly, concealed the crumbling equilibrium oE the States of Europe, is so full of holes and rents that it ss past mending. They know, of course, but it is a question whether the cost of re- pairing it would not he greater than the ndvantage of keeping up the fiction for a short time longer. It clears up the position. lio one winl think hence- forth to seize hold of a shred of the old cloak to cover his owtn weakness, he would be only laughed at. This is, of course, rather awkeard for those
			ho have fSres to conceal,zbutit iswanoadvantage for those wtho can rely on their own strength, andhave not tofear the gaze of the world. Itoputs an end to a false position which had no end of draw- backs, and relieves those who are strong from the necessity of letting themselves be paralyzed by the weakness of others. By their apathy in the cause of Switzerland the German Powers who are mostinterested a n the question of neutrality have relieved all the others from any moral obligations by which they may have still thought themselves hound to make the treaty of 1815 respected, and henceforth every one is at liberty to consult his own intereste alone in every general political question. The Emperor Napoleon may exult, for he has avenged France of the defeats of 1815, and has carried out more than his programme of modifying some of the dispositions made by the treaty which followed that defeat.
			As for Switzerland, the attitude of the German Powers modifies her position likevise. While she could hope to be supported in an unequal struggle undertaken in the interest of Central Europe as well as her own, she was quite willing to make sacriices to avert a poseible future danger; but, being left to herself, she must naturally consult her own interetts alone; and these push her mora towards France than towards any other Power. It is true France is the Power which can alone become formidable to her independence, but this independ- ence is almost as much in the interest of France as of Switzerland. Whatever the dis- proportion be in the forces of the two States, the ci-deveant Swiss Captain of Artillery must know that a successful attack against this little country would give rather more trouble than the humiliation of Austria, while the position gained by such an attack would make France not stronger, but weaker in any attaek made on the Rhine. She would be destroying the bulwarks of a great part of her own frontiers, and deprive herself of the support of a by no means contemptible ally. The possession of the Phiine by France is no danger for Switzerland, for it would add but little to the great disproportion
			of the �0rce3 oE the two countries, and no one will sappose the Swiss to be fools enough to feel a sen- timental interest in Oennny, which has left them lo their own resurce in the present decisive mfoment.
			No more able to rely for her independence on the guarantee of Europe, Switzerland is forced to find this guarantee in an understanding with France. The Btopping of the armaments is a sign that the Federal Council has come to the conviction that very littleis to be expected from the Powers. Tha troops of the Third Federal Division, part of which had been called out, have received the order to return home. The pretext given for this step is an assurance of the Piedmontesa governor that the French will not occupy Savoy until the voting has taken place, andl the ltalianParliamentspoken out. Youknow how true this declaration is, and sO does the Federal Council,
			and above all the people of Geneva, who can almost l ee from their town the demonstrations got up for the Imperial commissioner in North Savoy. This ldisarming tells, therefore, its owntale. Switzerland wbas ready to do her ownpart if others were not; let them bear the consequences. They are likely to be heavier for them than for Switzerland.
			As for the Congress or Conference, no one here has any faith in it. Even if it should meet it will uot begin before France has taken possession of the disputed districts, and thus taken nine points of the law in her own hands. The question wil thus be decided for the Swis3 before even the discuesion begins. The Conference may give as many assurances of neutrality as it likes; it is not in these that the Swiss eeek their safety, but in the means which a good frontier line would give them for guarding this neutrality by their own strength. By the occupation by the French of North Savoy the Swiss question Is decided likewise. There ought to be no Musion in this respect. A few more protocols added to those already existing about the neutrality of Switzerland,and theguarantees for this neutrality are only so much more waste paDer. Finis Salaudice means at the same time finir neutralitatis Hcelvetic.

			AUSTRIA.
			EFROMI OUR OWN CORESPONDMNT.)
			VIJJ N ~NA, APIRIL1I.
			Shortly before Count Rechberg fell sick there was a Ministerial crisis, which was cansed by a violent clashing of opinions on Hungarian matters. It would appear that the 3isnister-President and the Mlinister of the Interior deem it advisable to make some concessions to the Hungarians, but that the Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs and tho Minister of Finance refuse to yield to a people which has always offered a passive redstance to their measures. It is said that some of the discussions respecting Hlungary were exceedingly animated, and it must be suppoEed that they reaUy were so, as Count Leo Thun and Baron Bruck a few days ago expressed a wish to be permitted to retire from office. As Count iNadasdy, the Minister of Justice, also tendered his resignation, the Cabinet was for a time in danger of being entirely broken up, but the E'mperorinterfered, and desired his Mtinisters to postpone all further discussion of the Hungarian question for a fortnight. Count Rechberg is reco- vering from a bilious attack, which doubtless was caused by irritation and over-work.
			A S the late Count Szechenyi was a very great bene- factor to the kingdom of Hungary, which the Em- peror has declared to be an integral part of Austria, it would have been politic to do honour to his mortal remains, but the authorities yesterday " huddled oyer" the funeral in a way which disgusted the inbabitants of this city, and must necessarily greatly increase the animosity of the Hunga- rians to the Imperial Government. The family of Count Szechenyi notified to the friends of the deceased that the funeral ceremony would be performed in the church at D6bling on Wednos- day (to-day), at 1 o'clock, and, of course, they made their arrangementa accordingly. Yesterday morn- lng, however, it was made known to Countess Ssechenyi that the funeral must take place at 1 o'dock in the afternoon of the same day. The notice being so short, the relatives and friends of the deceased bad great difficulty in getting to D6bling at the time appointed, and when they did arrive they found that the service was nearly at an end. When it began I am unable to say, but it is an undeniable fact that it was over before the clock had struck 1. The police probably feared that there wduld be a national de- monstration at Gross Zinkendorf, for it insisted on the body being sent there yesterday evening, instead of to-morrowafternoon,whichwasthetime mentioned in the printed notification. According to private letters from Pesth and Presburg the Hungarian nation will wear mourning during sim weeks for the illustrious deceased. Some of the papers state that Count Szechenyi shot himself with a pistol which was loaded with powder " and water," but the post morlIem examination showed that small shot had formed the upper part of the charge. For five days before his death the Count took little or no food, but no one suspected that he intended to put an end to his life, although he, two days before his death, said to his wife, " Mly days are num- bered." In 1825 Count Szechenyi gave the whole of his annual income of (60,000. towards the establishment of a Hungarian Academy of Science, and he-to use his own phrase-was boarded and lodged at the expense of his friends for a whole year. After one of his journeys to England Szechenyi established the Hungarian Casino, or club, at Pesth, and made his fellow- countrymen acquainted with the advantages to be derived from racing. Thorough-bred English horses were, by his advice, introduced into the country, and some of the Hungarian studs now have a very high reputation. The lNational Theatre, of which mention has frequently been made in my cor- respondence, was built by subscription at the insti- gation of Szechenyi. In 1847 the Count's whole attention was direc'41 to railroad matters, and I recoUect his endeavuuring to impress upon me that great advantages wvere to be derived from a rail- road which should connect Vukovar, on the Danube, with some port-I believe it was Fiume-on the Adriatic.
			During the night of Easter Sunday the Emperor left this city for Payerbacl by a special train, which ran into a sand or rubbLh car in the neighbourhood of Pfafst.itten. The car was smashed, and the car- riage in which His XlMajesty and Prince Vasa were sit- ting was thrown off the rail, but no further damage was done. After a delay of four hours at the sta- tion at Pfaffstlitten, the illustrious travellers pursued their journey to Payerbach, where they had gone to shoot wood grouse or capercailzie. It was yeater- day stated that the Emperor was ill, but there can be no truth in the report, for I met His Majesty in the street a few hours ago, and he appeared to be in perfect health. He, however, looked out of temper aud somewhat careworn. The Archduke Ferdinand MIaximilian is now here.
			The papers tell us that 80,000 000 of the loan are likely to be taken, but I am stili of opinion that the boad fide subscriptions will not exceed 65,000,000, a sum which will suffice to cover the last year's deficit. The Oesterreichische Zeitung talks of the Bank resuming its cash payments "at no distant period," but the Austrians may thinkthemselves very fortunate if they are able to get their notes cashed ten years henuce. The heads of the maercantile firms Revoltels, Brambilla, and hIondolfo, were yester- day arrested at Triesto. They are said to be accused of having taken undue advantage cf the Govern-
			ment during the war; but there is reason to believe that the charge made against them is that they bribed certain commissariat officers. From Venice we learn that Count Moncenigo and Baron Zg_no arzo likely to represent Venetia in the enlarged "iBeichsrath." tneed hardly be said that the tvwo lobili named enjoy more confidence in Vienna than they do in their native city. The Stadtholder of Lower Austria yesterday began to examine the draught of a municipal law which has just been drawn up by the Commuon Council of this city, but no one appears to care how the matter is gettled, as it is generally felt that the present state of things cannot possibly last long. At present no ono ventures to pronounce the words " Constltu. tional Government" in the presence of the Emperor, but the time is not far distant when the Cabinet wil be obliged to declare that the present system can no ionger bo maintained. It is said that the Court party laughs at the warnings wvhich it receives,but it is difficult to believe that people can be so blind to impending danger.
			WVe learn from Belgrade that Prince Milcsch is at death's door. - --

A new insurgent band of 12 men had appeared between Susldon and Molina. The authorities of Tortosa, and of the province in which the town is situate, had agreed on reporting that they were con- vinced that Count de Montemolin and the Infante Don Fernando were with Ortega, and that they took to flight.

			LAW RE-PORT.
			ADMIRALTY COURT. APRI 14.
			THE TECLA CARME-DAIjAnV
			(Before Dr. LuSB:,GTON and TRITy MAsrmRs.1
			'w . was a cause of damge arising out of a colsion which took place on the night of the th of March, 1858, between the American vessld North American r en the Spanish vessel Tech Carmen, In St. CaUeoge's Channel
			The action wa brought by the owners of the North Ameri- can, and the facts as alleged in their pleadings, and stated In the evidence of their witnesses, were as follows :-The North American, 133 tons withe a ewm of 28 hands, Samuel Cwke, masther, was bsound from Mobie for lIver- pool,witha earg of otton. Aboutl 0 o'ltock onithegnight of the 8th of Mnch she was About 20 miles from Bardsey, which here s.R., and was heading about N.F Eby N., close hauled to tha wind on the port taek, and mak- ing about four knots an hour. The night wars dark and cloudy, the horizon was obscure in consequence of anow squalls, and the wind was NLTW. by N. A good look-out was being kept, and a bright light was burning at the bowsprit end. The Tech Carmen wa%s seen at the distance of about a quarter of a mile, two points on the starboard bow, without a lght. When the vesels were about 400 yagds apart the helm of the North American
			a tser the spanker was lowered, and the Teca Carmen wmhied. The Techa Carmen, however instead of k-eeP- ing her course as she wan bound to do, startoarded her helm, and bore down upon, and came into coUllsion with, the North American, which was bearing away under her pert helm, the Teclh Carmen's bowsprit passing under her bow- sprit, and striking her port bow near the hawee pipe. While the vessels were in contact, the master and crew of the Tecla Carmen got on board the North American, and the Tech&amp; CArmen soon aftrwards went sashore at Aberystwith. The col- llson was attributed to the wrant of a light on board the Techs Carmen and to her having starhoarded instead of k-eeping her course. The master and crew of the Tedsa Carmen gave a different account of the accident. The foilowin_ is the substance of their case :-Thne Tech Carmen, 2n5 tons, Domingo do Arana master, with a crew of 13 hands, was bound from Bristol for Liverpool, in balasat. Aboat half- past 10 on the night of the 8th of March, she was 28 miles west of Bardsey llght, standing to the westward, with yards braced up, close hauled on the starboard tack, and making about four knots an hour. The night was clear, and a strog gle ws bowin frm th NTLW.A bright light was urnng n te bwspit nd,anda go1 ookout was ~t~etnt ws reportd on theport tack about
			quare,edkp e course close hastdt tewnd h other vse,teNorth!:ecn,bigwthdose whetheshwol tae te ~es tp o ern away a-sd going clear. The NrhAeia,hwvr kept * course till cliInws miet,and * .n at the last mnomet h hl f The Tols
			awspthard uport and h was lufdup
			aned therteby dedver stroarmuch adamag that the crewower
			to the want of a goo look-out on hoard the North American, and to her not keepoing clear.
			S5everal witnesses were examined on both sides on, the previous occassions when the case was before the Court, and some pieces of wreak said to have been part of the Tedsa Carmen, found at Aberystwlth, were produced to show the manner in which the two vesses had como into contact.
			In a former action, in which the Tedla Carmen was the Plaintiff and the North AmericaLn the defendant, the Court pronounced both vessels to blame and that judgment was. affirmed, on appeal, by the Judicia Committee of the Privy Council.
			The case was argued by Dr. DEASE, Q.C., end Dr. Ss'L'-ac (with whom was Mr.V!. Lushington) for the 'North American ; and by Mr. MA&amp;mSTn, Q.C., and Dr. Twiss, Q. C., for the Teola Carmen.
			Dr. LUSaresGOvo, in summing up, dlirected the Trinity Mastrs hatupo quetios o pue lw this Court was houd b th deisin o te Jdical ommtte,and even uponquetios offee, wen te crcustaces of two cases wer prcisly he am, i wold e te dtyof the Court to folow he eciionof he udiialComitte in order to avod a uneemy cnflct etwen he wotribunals. Buat in he resnt asethir iscetin wuldinno way be fetteed b thedeciion f th Jud Cia Cm Itein the formr acion It oul he mposibl toconsider this case wsthut efernceto te frmeracton,for the two suite were necessarily connected. In the first suit he had held that both vessels were to blame, in accordance with the opinion of the two Elder Brethren who heard that case. If they should come to a different opinion upon the evidence lu this acseheshoxld be plaoed in avery paidflpsiin b nus not birk he Ipartial performance of their duty and he should not hesitate to retract his former opinon if justice required It. The case of the North American was the same in this as in the first suit, but the case set up by the Teals Carmen was substantially a new and a very different one. Ho dlid not say that it was not competent t-o parties to change their mede of pleading In two eaita arising out of the same transaction, but he did think they were debarred In comnmon honesty from bringing the same witnesses to speak to a newstate of facts. But the evidence of the master of the Tecal Carmen in this case was in direct apposition to his evidence in the first case. He[ had followed the plea In his evidence, end had shown that [he was utterly regardless of the solemnity of his oath. Tlhe Court deprecated such a etnres of proceeding end discarded the master's evidence as utterly worthless. The rest of the seramen had not followed the same course as the mast-er, but be thought their evidence would not upon examination be found to fit in with the defence now ret up. But they must also examine the evidence of the North American, for she would not be enititled to recover if she hod failed in proving her allegations. His LordIship then went briefly through the evidence, and when he had concluded said that whaer might ho the opinion pronounced by the Trinity Masters the Court would take time to consider Its decision.-Judgment was accordingly deferred.

			| INSOL YRNT DEBTORS' COURT, AprU 14.
			IX RE BUSICE RICURDS PEMBERPTON.
			(Before the CmlEF ComIso.iNm)
			This insolvent described as having occasionally specn- lated in the fissn, was opposed by Mr. Nichols, on the part of Mr. Espin, an attorney.
			In 1857 Mr. Espin was applied to by the insolvent's brother, Wiiam Pemberton, an attorney, of Southampton. street, Bloomsbury, for a loan of 3001., having had in the previous year another loan transaction, and he proposed the insolvent's acceptance and an assignment of a legacy of 5001. under the will of a person named Brettle, to whom he was appointed executor, and on account of which he wanted the money. The bill on which the moneg was advanced was not paid, and by a proceeding in Chancery It was ascertained that there was a prior claim to 900I. on the fund to Mr. Cook, of Warw/ick-street. Mr. Espin sald that in 1857 William Pemberton absconded on account of his liabilities on account of the celebrated Colonel Waugh, and was, he believed, in Parts ; he opposed on the ground that the insolvent was not In a condition to become security for his brother, and by which security he had lost his moneo.
			It appeared that the debts and labilities exceeded 4,0001., and the appearance before the Court was attributed to the unfortuate speculations in the funds, Erom the insol- vent's examination it appeared that ho had been an " out- sider,: and joined his brother and speculated, by which con- siderable leases had been incurred. He had accepted bills in blank for his brother, and was not aware that he was embarrassed when he told him he was, in consequence of his liabilifies for Colonel Waugh, which then amounted to between 5,0001. and 6,0001. He believed he was residing at Paris or Boulogne, and had addressed a letter to him a fort- night ago.
			im answer to a question, the Insolvent ssid he was ap- pointed trustee to Sir Charles and Lady Pigott. Lady Pigott, who was the daughter of Mrs. Colonel Waugh, had applied to him on the subjest. He had had no communica. tion on the matter.
			Mr. NIcEuoLs submitted that the debt with Mr. Espin had been incurred without reasonable or probable expectation of payment, The learned counsel reviewed the evidence given by his client and the insolvent.
			Tho C=EF COmmLSSONMEn was of opinion that Mr. Espin had advanced the money in question, not on the faith of the insolvent's name, but on the faith of the assgnment of the legacy, which ;wold have been sufficient but for the deception as to the prier claim. As explained, there was nothing discreditable in tho transaction, and it was clear that the insolvent's name did not wreIgh a feather In the matter i -t; d
			The Insolvente was diselsarged.,

			.ouls Blanchet, a foreign hawker of jewelry, was charged, on remand with being in possession of a gold watch, some brooches, and some diamonds, knowing themto have been stolen.
			It appeared from the evidence that about the middle of last month a French jeweller named Joel, carrying on business in Parls, was staying at the White flart Tavern, Bishopsgate-street Without, and that duiing his absencb from his room one evening his box was broken open, and a gold wateh, a cameo brooch, and several diamond brooches, to the value of 175b, were abstracted. The police were at once set to work, but for some days discovered no clue to the perpetrators of the robbery. sentiltheprisonerwasstopped at a shop while offering some diamonds for sale. Wuet searched some other diamonds were found upon him, and further inquiry led to the discovery that the prisoner had sold the gold watch stolen from lur. Joel for 141., while numerous loose diamonds were recovered from various pawnbrokers, who had taken them in pledgo since the robbery from a person resembling the prisoner, who, it was supposed, had broken up the brooches in which they were originally set, in the hope of destroying their identity. The cameo brooch stolen from Mr. Joel was also found upon the prisoner, and also a valuable gold brooch, which led to another and dis- tinct charge being preferred against him, this particular brooch being Identified as her property by Mrs. Oddy, the keeper of a coffee-shop in Bermondsey. The prisoner, it was deposed, lodged at this house during the month of February, but towards the end of she month a drawer was broken open in one of the bedrooms, and a gold brooch, bb

He thought it highly improper, as It cffered facilities to children to pilfer and rob their parents and employers when goods could so readily be got rid of. He therefore fined the defeudant 40s. end costs, which were immedliatelv naid.

			WE5TMNSTER.-Two men of not very respectable ap- pearance, who gave the namnes of John Webster and Henry Francis, were charged under the following circumtanoe -
			It appeared from the evidence of John Short, the prose- cutor, a young man between 19 and 20, that on the 5th tlt. he was walking along linightsbridge, when, the prisoner Francis, whom he had not seen before, met him and ob- tained his consent to have a glass of ale with him. While they were drinking Webster came in, and, seeming not to know Francis, began saylng he had just come to London, and at length he and Francis agreed to have a game at bagatelle, for which purpose they adjourned to another publichoise, and persuaded the prosecutor to go with them. There the latter was induced to bet upon the game, and, upon faith of Francis's representation that he was a good player and was sure to win, prosecutor bet hlis watch and chain upon the result, and Webster won. A second game was played, in which prosecutor betted upon Francis again, with a view of recovering hia property, but Webster won a second tiie, and telling prosecator to go home and get the money he had lost on the second game, the latter did so accom. panted for a short distance by Francis, who then left hin, and on his returnmg to the publichouso both prisoners bad ditsappeared, and ho had not seen them ogain till Friday night ls.st.

			WORS.IP-STRsnT.-AMlary Bisley, described as the daughter of a commercial traveller, was charged on remand with the following robbery.
			The prisoner entered the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Isner, the wife of a merchant In the city, with a privats residence in the New North-road, about six weeks ago as house or parlour-mald, and conducted herself to that lady's satis- faction till Sunday morning three weeks, when, wlthout giving the slightest intimation of her intention to leave, she abruptly left the house, dld not return, and on the place being examined by Mrs. Isner it was discovered that she had stolen two silk dresses, a cloth overcoat, a pair of gloves, and such a miscellaneons collection of articles that they even included a rhubarb pie. Mr. Ismer, on being ap- prised by his wife of the conduct of the girl, informed the police of the robbery, and Luff, of the N division, being em- ployed to investigate It, went round to the different pawn. brokers and at one ascertained sufficient about the prisoner to lead him over to Walworth, and there, in a house of scandalous repute, he discovered the girl, who was so terri- fied on seeing him that she fainted. On searching this house the whole of the property stolen from the prosecutor, even to the empty plo-ish, was discovered there, with the exception of the overcoat and gloves, which the girl, on re- covering her senses said a Jew had bought of her in Petticoat-line for is. The coat, when new, cost the pro- secutor 31. l5s., and Luff therefore set off aftar this Jew, whom he discovered standing at a sale-shop door with the cost on his back, and who told the officer, as he now did the magistrate, that he had bought the property inocently, as he had met tbe prlsoner early in the morn with a large carpet bag, and that on asking her if she had anything for sle, she replied that shehad, puUed the coat out of the tag, said she had a very kind mistress, who had presented her with the contents of the bag, and that he there offered her 5s. for the coat, and she took it.
			The prlsoner was remanded several times for these facts to be elidted, and on Saturday her father, a very respectable but grief-stricken man, atteided to claim her. He said the girl had been wayward and unsettled at home, and was so anxious to go ont to service that, although there was not the slighteit necessity for her so doing, he had at last consented and she entered that of Mxrs. Ismer, which was t'he first and last she had been in. She had always been strictly honest, and he-hadnever till now known anything Immoral or imn. proper in her conduct.
			Lff said that on questioning the woman of the house where the gir was discovered how It wa that the priqoner
			came there, shereplHed that there vas nothing surpridng in that, as she had known the girl for 1S months.
			The father expreled the treatest astonishment at this evidence, and assured the matis that he had not the remotest idea his daughter had formedsuch adis5mceful ao- quanitance, or he should have instantly stpped it.
			Mr. Iner could not thi under such circumstances of following the prosecution any further, and
			3Mr. D'EYNcouxT, who sad it was eInly a most dis- treaslng case, ordered the whole of the property to be given
			up, end, as thie prisoner had already beenj in custody some tie, sent the girl, who was sobbling incessantly, with her face clasped inher hands, for .~ lengthe/ned period to are-; fermator.

			THASES.-Anna Crawley, a wonman about 25 yeaTs of age, was brought up on remand charged with stealing vanous sums of money from a girl named Elibeth Green, U years of age.
			Mr. Charles Young, solcitor, conducted the prosecution. The case was one of a very remarkable nature, and occu- pled the attention of the magistrate for several hours.
			The prosecutor is Mr. George Greem, an englneer, carm - ing on business in White Horse-lane, Stepney, and he had the misfortune to have for a relative a man of in- different character, named King, who had been for some time cohabiting with the prisoner. In the early parb of February last King and the pnisoner met Mr. Green's daoughter, a. very beautiful sad artless child. King said to the prisoner, " This is my niece-my sister's child." About a week after this introduction the prlsoner met the girl in Beaumont-square, Stepney, and after some conversation persuaded her to call poo a Mrs. Moss, the wife of a Ceston-house offices, residing at No. 3, Beaumont-square and borrow 4. The girl was also instructed to say that tse loan was for her mother. The little girl waited upon Mrs. Moss, who was well acquainted with Mr. Green and his family, and gave the child the money without the least hesltation, believing at the time that Mrs. Green had sent her daughter for it. The girl returned to the prisoner and gave her the money. The prisoner then exacted from the girl a solemn promise never to reveal to any one what had taken place, and threatened to take her away, kil her, and tear her to pieces if she ever mentioned the affair to her parents. From this time the prisoner appeared to have absolute control over the mind of the simple girl and sent her on three other occa- sions to Mm Moss for loans of money, sad to say it was for her mother. The prisoner also frequently met the girl on her way to the houes of tradesmen with whom her parents dealt, took from her the money with which she was Intrusted to purchase articles, and directed the girl to request the tradesmen to " put it down" to Mr. Green. This happened in 14 or 15 instances. Some- times the girl told the prlsoner she had no money, but the woman Invariably searched the girl in the streets, and took from her pocket or her hands the money intrusted to her by her mother. The prisoner met the girl in the Mile-end-road one afternoon, and elicited from her that her father was in the habit of using the Three Crown3 Tavern, in the road opposite tbL- Jews' Hospita and obtaining cash for his checks there. The prisoner then instracted the girl to go to
			Irs. Gospeck, the landlady of the Three Crowns, and ask her for the loan of 10s., and to state as an excuse for borrowing that sum that Mr. Green was close at hand, that he had a payment to make, and that he had no time to go home for a check. Mrs. Gospeck, on hearing the story from the girl, handed her 10s., with which she returned to the prisoner, who took it from her and repeated her threats. On Saturday, the 17th of March, and two succeeding Satur- days, the girl received 3s. 7Vd. fromher mother on each day. to purchase grocery at the shop of Mr. William Ricketts, of No. 16, MIle-end-road. The prisoner intercepted the girl on each occasion, took the money from her, and directed her to request the grocer to book the amount. MIr. oRicketts complied with the girls request. He was, however, not allttle surprised at the girl asking him to give credit to her father, who had been in the praoeice of paying ready money for his grocery for a long time, and he made a communication to
			Ir. Green, who questioned his daughter, and she revealed all that had occurred betweenherandth prisener. On Satur-'
			the girl was again despatehed to the shop d t 7th Rinketts to parchase grocery. On this occasion the money, consisting of a florin, a sbilling, a sixpence, and some copper coin was marked. The prisoner intercepted the girl as usual, took the money, and instructed her to ask Mr. Rticketts to " put it down" to her father. No steps, however, were taken to watch the prisoner or to take the marked coins from her, and the consequence was that before she was apprehended the same evening by Walker, police-constable 488 K, she had expended the whole of the money in drink. When taken into custody at her own home, in Edward-street, Stepney, she denied that she had ever seen the girl, or that she had been out at aU that day.
			Mr. Moss, Mrs. Gospeck, and ir. Rteketts severally confirmed the statement of thegirl, and the parts they had taken in the transactions.
			Two witnesses were also caUed to prove that the prisoner was seen near Mr. Green's residence on the 7th inst., be- fore the girl was sent to the grocer's shop.
			Walker, the police-constable who had charge of the case, said the prisoner-was a most dangerous thief, and was con- victed of felonykn1858, and sentenced to 12 monthe' ixn- prisonment and hard labour. A former convidtion was then proved against her. He believed she had been convicted of felony five times, and he knew she had been in custody 25 timnes for being drunk and disorderly.
			Theprisoner behaved in a most extraordinary manner throughout the whole examination, and frequently abused Iand threatened the girl, and applid to her the most offensive epithets. Mr. Yardiey twice threatened to take the deposi- Iteens inthe prisener's absence, ,in to leek hernup. H3er ejaculations were continuous whle the little girl was under examination; and at last, when the magistrate said he should commit her for trial, she uttered the most terrible maledistions.
			hMr. Y.tDaxn.-Remove the prisoner; I wil hear no more of this shocking language.
			The prisoner was dragged from the dock by the gaoler. she made a determined resistance, and was removed to the cell while she was cursing and swearing in an awful manner.

			SOUTscWAU.L-Walter Grimstone Bond, a young man of respeotable appearance, was brought up for final examina- tion, charged with stealing two horses, worth 851., the pro- perty of his employers, Peak and Co., Mil-street, Dock- head.
			When the evidence was concluded,
			Mr. Edwin, on behalf of the prisoner, contended that there was no felonious intention in the affair. The horses were unfit for the work, and his client thought he had authority to dispo3e of them for the best he could, and re- place them with better horses. He was about to do so when he was taken into cmstody, and the sole cause of his sabsent- ing himself from his duties was that he was about looking after money due to him.
			Mr. ComB1E told him that it was quite clear from the evi- dence that the prlsoner had no right to seU the horses, the proceeds of which he had converted to his own use. It ws a very bad case, and he should commit him for trial, but he would be further remanded for a week, as the prosecutor had received some communioation as to his former character which the officer must inquire into.

			LAMEr-Charles Vowles, a boilermaker, and pow-rful man, was charged with stabbing and dangerously wounding Joseph Luscom be, apolice-oonsable, 161 P, with inteut to murder, or do him some grievous harm.
			Police-constable Charles CDa, 346 P, deposed 'hat on the night before, about 12 o'clock, he accompanied tho cor stable Luscombe, at his request, to a publichouse in Pomeroy- street, Peckham, ornear Hatcham. Onreaching there they stopped for a few moments, when the prisoner came out of the publiebouse and crossed over to where they were, and, peinting toLuscombe, said, "That's the feUow who took me to the statlonhouse last night, but it would take 40 to take me there again. If you but just put your hands on me now it wil be the worse for you." Luscombetold him he did not wish to have anything to do with him, and wished him to go home. The prisoner said he shoutld do as he liked, and should walk about the streets aU night If he thought proper. A man who was with him advised the prisoner to go home, and said the constable had only done his duty, and the prisoner then went up the street.
			Mr. NoBToN.-VWhat had the prisoner been taken to the station-house for on the previous night ?
			Witness.-For assaulting a woman, but the Inspector on duty did not detain him, but left the woman to come before a magistrate and get a summons against him if she thought proper. The witness then went on to say, that after the prisoner had gone he went on his own beat, and Luscombe proceeded on his, which watS In the same direction the pri- soner hatdgone, and in to or three mminutes he heard loud calls for him. He In consequence run up the street, and found the prisoner in Luscombe's custody, hut ac he (witness) came up Luseombe staggered back and let the prisoner go, saying at the same time, " Look out for the knife." Witness laid hold of the prisoner, who In- stantly struck him on the face with his first, or he thought at the time something barder, and knocked him down, and then made his escape. Luseombe followed him, and, sound- ing his rattle, another constable came up and took the pri- soner. Luscombo, on the prisoner being secured, said in his presence he believed he had stabbed him, but the pri= soner made no reply. At the station-house witness found in his coat pocket the stone ho produced tied up in a hand- kerchief, and which in that state formed a formidable weapon, and also a penknife. Luscombe when exa- mined at the station was found to be stabbed over tho left shoulder, and to have lost a great deal of blood, and a surgeon was sent for to dress the wound. Luscombe was unable to attend, When the prisoner was charged at the station-house with stabbing tuscombe the only reply he made was " But you have not found the knife." He had been d , but knew well what he was about.
			The instrument produced is one of a most formidable character. It was in the shape of a dirk or Spanish knife with a blade about four inches in length, and tapering to the finest point, and opened with a spring. Sergeant Baker Informed the maglstrate that, on comparing it with the cut through the great-coat and dothes of Luscombo, It fitted exactly.
			The following certificatewas here handed in, viz,:-
			" Isetly tbat Joseph Ijoecombe, 161 P. hbm relved a pw3isf4e
			od over his left ehoulder, and is usable to attend berors the mara- trate orna few darSs JOHN T. GEII7TR an."
			The prlsoner, in reply to the charge, said the constables found hin drunk, and, Instead of letting him go home, beat him about so that he was as sore as a boil all over.
			He was remanded.

			UWMITIC MOVOTHEISM.!
			(Continued from The Times of Aprl 14.)
			WVhat, then, is the difference between the Aryan nnd Semitic nomenclature for the Deity? Why did the pious invocations of the Aryan world turn into a blasphemous mocking of the Deity, wheres the Semitic nations are supposed to have fouDn. from the first the true name of God? Before we look an-where else for an answer to thle question we must look to language itse', aud here wve see that the Semitic dialecOs could never, by any possibility, have produced such names as Dyaus (Zeus), Varuna (Uranos), Marut (wind), or tUshas (Eos). They had no doubt names for the bright sky, for the tent of heaven, and for the dawLn. But these names were so distinctly felt ,S appellatives, that they could never be thought of as proper names, whether as names of the Deitv, or -s names of deities. This peculiarity has been illus- trated with great skill by M. Renan. We differ from him when he tries to explain the difference between the mythological phraseology of the Aryan and the theological phraseology of the Semitic races, by assigning to each a peculiar theological instinct. We cannot, in fact, see how the admission of such an instinct-i.e., of an unknown and incomprehensible power, helps us in any way whatsoever. His problem, how- ever, is exactly the same as ours, and it would be impossible to state that problem in a more telling manner than he has done. The rain, he says (p. 79), is represented, in all the primitive mythologies of the Aryan race, as the fruit of the embraces of Heaven and Earth. " The bright sky," says eEschylus, in a passage which one might suppose was taken from the Vedas, " loves to pene- trate the earth; the earth on her part aspires to the heavenly marriage. Rain falling from the loving aky impregnates the earth, and she produces for mortals pastures of the flocks and the gifts of Ceres." In the Book of Job,t on the contrary, it is God who tears open the waterskius of Heaven (xxxviii., 37), who opens the courses for the floods (Ibid. 25), who engenders the drops of dew (Ibid. 28).
			FtHe draws towards Him the mists from the waters, "'Which pour down as rain, and form their vapours. 'Afterwards the clouds spread them out,
			"They fall as drops on the crowds of men."-(Job, xxxvi.,
			27, 28.)
			-oe charges the night with damp vapours,
			-Ho drives before Him the thunder-bearing cloud.
			'It is driven to one side or the other by His command, "To execute all that He ordains
			' On the face of the universe,
			'Whether it be to punish His creatures
			"Or to m ake thereof a proof of His mercy," -(Job,
			xxxvii., 11-13.)
			Or, again, Proverbs xxx., 4,-
			"b Who hath gathered the wind in bis fists? Who bath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his Bon's name, if thou canst tell ?"
			It has been shown by ample evidence from the Rig Veda how many mythes were suggested to the Aryan world by various names of the dawn, the day- spring of life. The language of the ancient Aryans of India had thrown out many names for that heavenly apparition, and every name, as it ceased to be understood, became, like a decaying seed, the germ of an abundant growth of mythe and legend. Why should not the same have happened to the Semitic names for the dawn ? Simply and solely because the Semitic words had no tendency to phonetic corruption; simply and solely because they continued to be felt as appellatives, and would inevitably have defeated every attempt at my- thological phraseology such as we find in India and Greece. Vhen the dawn is mentioned in the Book of Job (ix., 11), it is God " who commandeth the sun and it riseth not, and sealeth up the stars." It is His power which causeth the dayspring to know its place, that it miaht take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it (Job xxviii., 12-13; Renan, Livre de Job, pref. 71). Shahar, the dawn, never becomes an indenendent agent; she is never spoken of as Eos rising from the bed of her husband Tithonos (the settinq sun), solely and simply because the word retained its power as an appellative, and thus could not enter into any mythological metamorphosis.
			Even in Greece there are certain words which have remained so pellucid as to prove unfit for mythological refraction. S&amp;leite in Greek is so clearly the moon that her name would pierce through the darkest clouds of mythe and fable. Call her Becate, and she wiU bear any dis- guise, however fancifuL It is the same with the Latin Luta. She is too clearly the moon to be mis- taken for anything else, but cal her Ltci?ta, and she will readily enter Into various mythological phases. If, then, the names of sun and moon, of thunder and lightning, of light and day, of night and dawn could not yield to the Semitic races fit appellatives for the Deity, where were they to be found? If the names of Heaven or Earth jarred on their ears as names unfit for the Creator, where could they find more appropriate terms ? They would not have objected to real names such as Jupiter Optimus Maximnus, or zEi'g " Mroq /ityza e70, if such words could have been framsed in their dialects, and the names of Jupiter and Zeus could have been so ground down as to become synonymous with the general term for " God." NTot even the Jews could have given amore exalted definition of the Deity than that of Optimnus Ma cimus-the BestandtheGreatest; and their very name of God, Jehovah, is generally supposed to mean no more than what the Peleiades of Dodona said of Zeus, zEtc ,7v, Zt',c .aTiv, Zttc EIE7at' 6i "tEydXe Zst,-" He was, He is, He wiUl be, oh great Zeus !" Not being able to form such substantives as Dyaus, or Varuna, or Indra, the descendants of Shem fixed on the pre- dicates which in the Aryan prayers folow the name of the Deity, and called Him the Best and the Greatest, the Lord and King. If we examine the numerous names of the Deity in the Semitic dialects we find that they are aU adjectives, ex- pressive of moral qualities. There is El, strong; Bel or Baal, Lord; Beel-samnin, Lord of Heaven; Adonis (in Pheenicia), Lord; Harnes (at Gaza), our Lord; Shet, Master, afterwards a demon; .M1olochs, M1ilam, Mfalika, King; Bliuzn, the Highest (the God of MIeichisedek); Ramn and Birnmot, the Exalted; and many more names, all originally adjectives
			and expressive of certain general qualities of the leity, hut all raised by one or the other of the Semitic tribes to be the names of God or of that idea which the first breath of life, the first sight of this world, the first consciousness of existence, had for ever impressed and implanted in the human maind. But do theae names prove that the people who invented them had a clear and settled idea of tle unity of the Deity? Do we not find among the Aryan nations that the same superlatives, the same natmes of Lord and King, of Master and Father, are used when the human mind is brought face to face with the Divine, and the human heart pours out in prayer and thanksgiving the feelings inspired by the presence of God'? Brahman, in Sanskrit meant originally Power, the same as El. It resisted for a long time the mythological contagion, but at last it yielded like all other names of God, and became the name of one God. By the first man who formed or fixed these names, Brahman, like El, and like every name of God, was meant. no doubt, as the best expression that could be found for the image reflected from the Creator upon the mind of the creature. But in none of these words can we see any dlecided proof that those who framed them had nrrived at the clear perception of One God, and were thus secured aaainst the danger of polytheism. Like Dyaus, or Indra, or Brahman, Baal and El and 3loloch were names of God, but not yet of the One God. And we have only to follow the history of these Semitic names in order to see that, in spite of their superlative meaning, they proved no stronger bulwark against polytheism than the Latin 40jirtimus Maxim us. The very names which we saw explained before as meaning the Highest, the Lord, the MIaster, are represented in the Pheeuician mythologyas standing to each other in the relation of Father and Son. (Renan, p. 60.) There is hardlyoone single Semitic tribe which did not at times forget the original meaning of the names by which they called on God. lf the Jews had remembered -the meaning of El, the Omnipotent, they could not have worshipped Baal, the Lord, as different from EEl. But.as the Aryan tribes bartered the names of their gods, and were glad to add the worship of Zeusto thatof Ucanos, the worship of Apollon to that 'of Zeus, the worship of Hermes to that of Apollon, the Semitic nations likewise were ready to try the

			aan insinet: tzlraram frc4 cpepdlas, tameTh oSrjuae recurret. But the history even of the Jews is made up of an almost uninterrupted series of relapses into polytheism. Let us admit, on the contrary, that God had in the beginning revealed HIimself the same to the ancestors of the whole human race. Let us then observe the natural divergence of the languages of man, and
			sonsider the pecu,iar difficulties that bad to be over- come in framing names for God, and the peculiar manner in which they were overcome in the Semitic and Aryan languages, and everything that followswill he inteligible. If we consider the abundance of synonymes into which all ancient languages burst out at their first starting-if we remember that there were hundreds of names for the earth and the sky, the san and the moon, we shall not be suir- prised at meeting with more than one name for God both amongv the Semitic and the Aryan nations. If we consider how easily the radical or significa- tive elements of words were absorbed aud obscured In the Aryan, and how they stood out in bold re- lief in the Semitic languages, we shaU appreciate the difficulty which the Shemites experienced in framing any name that should not seem to take too onesided a view of the Deity by predicating but one quality, whether strength, dominion, or majesty; and we shall equally perceive the snare which their very language laid for the Aryan nations, by supply- ing them with a number of words which, though they seemed harmless as meaning nothing except what by tradition or definition they were made to mean, yet were ful of mischief owing to the re- coUectionswhich, at any time, they might revive. Dyans in itself was as good a name as any for God, and in some respects more appropriate than its de- rivative dera, the Latin deus, which the Romance nationsstiUlusewithoutmeaning-anyharm.ButDyaus had meant sky for too long a time to become en- tirely divested of all the old mythes or sayings which were true of Dyaus, the sky, but could only be re- tained as fables if transferred to Dyanas, God. Dyaus, the Bright, might be called the husband of the earth; but, when the same mythe was repeated of Zeus, the god, then Zeus became the husband of Demeter, Dmete-r became a goddess, a daughter sprang from their union, and all the sluices of mythologaical madness were opened. There were a few men, no doubt, at all times, who saw through this mythological phraseology, who caUed on God, though they caUled him Zeus, or Dyaus, or Jupiter. Xenophanes, one of the earliest Greek heretics, boldly maintained that there was but " one God, and that He was not like unto men, either in body or mind."'* A poet in the Veda asserts dis- tinctly, " They caU lim Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni ; then He is the well-winged heavenly Garut- mat ; that which is One the wise call it many ways; they call it Agni, Yama, i,ttarisvan.t But, on the whole, the charm of mythology prevailed among the Aryan nations, and a return to the primitive intui- tion of God and a total negation of all gods were rendered more diflicult to the Aryan than te the
			eiucmtm man. l:ise iemitic man had hardly ever to resist the allurements of mythology. The names with which he invoked the Deity did not trick him by their equivocal character. Nevertheless, these Semitic names, too, thouah predicative in the begin- ning, became subjective, and from being the various names of One Being lapsed into names of various beings. Hence arose a danger which threatened well- nigh to bar to the Semitic race the approach to the conception andworship of theOneGod. Nowherecan we see this danger more clearly than in the history of the Jews. The Jews had, no doubt, preserved from the beainning the idea of God, and their names of God contained nothina but what might by right be ascribed to Him. They worshipped a single God, and, whenever they fell into idolatry, they felt that they had fallen away from God. But that God, under whatever name they invoked Him, was espe- ciaUy their God, their own national God, and His existence did not exclude the existence of other gods or demons. Of the ancestors of Abraham and Nachhor, even of their father (Joshua xxiv., 2), Terah, we know that in old time, when they dwelt on the other side of the flood, they served other gods. At the time of Joshua these gods were not yet forgotten, and, instead of denying their existence altogether, Joshua only exhorts the people to put away the gods which their fathers served on the other side of tlh' flood and in Egypt, and to serve the Lord. " Choose ye this day," he says, "whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we wiUl serve the Lord." Such a speech, exhorting the people to make their choice between various gods would have been unmeaning if addressed to a nation which had once conceived the unity of the Godhead. Even images of the gods were not unknown to the family of Abraham, for, though we know nothing of the exact form of the teraphim, or images which Rachel stole from her father, certain it is that Laban calls them his gods. (Genesis, xxxi., 19, 30.) But what is much more significant than these traces of polytheism and idolatry is the hesitating tone in which some of the early patriarchs speak of their God. "When Jacob flees before Esau into Padan- Aram and awakes from his vision at Bethel he does not profess his faith in the One God, but he bargains, and says, " If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God." (Genesis xxviii., 20.) Language of this kind evinces not only a temporary want of faith in God, but it shows that the conception of God had not yet acquired that complete universality which alone deserves to be caled monotheism, or belief in the One God. To him who has seen God face to face there is no longer any escape or doubt as to who is to be his god; God is his god, whatever befall. But this Jacob learnt not until he had struggled and wrestled with God, and committed himself to His care at the very time when no one else could have saved him. In that struggle Jacob asked for the true name of God, and he learnt from God that HIis name wa-s secret. (Genesis xxxiL, 29.) After that, his God was no longer one of many gods. His faith was not like the faith of Jethro (Exodus xxvii., 11), the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Mloses, who when he heard of all that God had done for Mloses acknowledgedl that God (Jehovah) was greater than all gods (Elohim). This is not yet faith in the One God. It is a faith hardly above the faith of the peoDle who were haltina hbtfwpn
			Jehovah and Baal, -and who when they saw what the Lord did for Elijah fell on their faces and said, "The Lord He is the God." And yet this limited faith in Jehovah as the God of the Jews, as a God more powerful than the gods of the heathen, as a God above all gods, betrays itself again and again in the history of the Jews. The idea of many gods is there, and wherever that idea exists, wherever the plural of god is used in earnest, there is polytheism. It is not the names of Zeus, Hermes, &amp;c., which constitute the polytheism of the Greelks, it is the plural &amp;uot, gods, which con- tains the fatal spell. WVe do not know what -I. Renan means when he says that Jehovah with the Jews "A'est pas I- plus graumi cntre plusie'Lrs dietir; c'est le Dieu zuniqiue." It was so with Abraham, it was so after Jacob had been changed into Israel, it was so with Moses, Elijah, and Jeremiah. But what is the meaning of the very first commandment -" Thou, shalt hare wone other Gods but me?" Could this command have been addressed to a nation to whom the plural of God was a nonentity ? It might be answered that the plural of God was to the Jes
			as revolting as it is to us, that it was revolting to their faith, if not to their reason. But bow was it that their language tolerated the plural of a word which excludes plurality as much as the wordfor the cen- tre of a sphere. No man who had clearly perceived the unity of God, could say with the Psalmist (lXxxvi., S), " Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, 0 Lord, neither are there anv works like unto Thy work;s." Though the same poet savs " Thou art God alone," he could not have compared God with other gods if his idea of God had really roached that all-embracing character which it had with Abraham, 3Moses, Elijah, and Jeremiah. Nor would God have been praised as the " great King above all gods" by a poet in whose eyes the gods of the heathen had been recognized as what they were -mighty shadows, thrown by the mighty works of

			%od, and intercepting for a time the pure light of the Godhead.
			WYe thus arrive at a diffiSeent conviction from that which B. PRenan baa made the basis of the history of the Semitic race. We can see nothing that would justify the admission of a monothe.stic mnstbct, granted to the Semitic, and withheld from tie Aryan race. They both share in the primitive intuition of God, they are both exposed to dangers in framin7 names for God, and they both fall into polytheisr . What is peculiar to the Aryan race is their mythological phraseology superadded to their polytheism, what is peculiar to the Semitic race is their belief in national gods-in a god chosen by his people as his people had been chosen by him.
			No doubt WI. Renan might say that we ignored his problem, and that we have not removed the difficulties which drove him to the admission of a monotheistic instinct. Etow is the fact to be explained, he might ask, that the three great religions of the world in which the unity of the Deity forms the key note, are of Semitic origin, and that the Aryan nations, wherever they have been brought to a worship of the one God, invoke Him with names borrowed from the Semitic languages ? But let us look more closely at the facts before we venture on theories. Mohammedanism, no doubt, is a Semitic religion,?and its very core is Alonotheism. But did Mohammed invent MIonotheism? Did he invent even a new name of God? (Renan, p. 23.) Not at all. Hia object was to destroy the idolatry of the Semitic tribes of Arabia, to dethrone the angels, the Jinn, the sons and daughters who had been assigned to Allah, and to restore the faith of Abraham in one God. (Renan, p. 37.) And how is it w ith Christianity? Did Christ come to preach a faith in a new God? Did He or
			Iis disciples invent a new name of God? No, Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfil, and the God whom
			tie preacliect was the (.od of Abraham. And who is the God of Jeremiah, of Eiijah, and of Moses? WTe answer again, the " God of Abraham." Thus the faith in the one living God, which seemed to require the admission of a monotheistic instinct, grafted in every member of the Semitic family is traced back to one man, to him "iin whom aU fami- lies of the earth shall be blessed." (Gen. xui., 3; Acts iii., 25; Gal. iii., 8.) And if from our earliest childhood we have looked upon Abraham, the Friend of God, with love and veneration; if our first impressions of a truly god-fearing life were taken from him,who left the land of his fathers to live a stranger in the land whither God had caUed him, who always listened tothe voice of God, whe- ther it conveyed to him the promise of a son in his old age, or the command to sacriRice that son, his only son Isaac, his venerable figure will assume still more majestic proportions when we see in him the life-spring of that faith which was to unite al the nations of the earth, and the author of that blessing which was to come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ. And, if we are asked how this one Abraham possessed not only the primitive intuition of God as He had revealed Himself to al mankind, but passed through the denial of all other gods to the know- ledge of the one God, we are content to answer that it was by a special Divine Revelation. The Father of Truth chooses His own prophets, and He speaks to them in a voice stronger than the voice of thunder. It is the same inner voice through which God speaks to all of us. That voice may dwindle away, and be- come hardly audible ; it may lose its Divine accent, and sink into the language of worldly prudence; but it may also, from time to time, assume its real nature, with the chosen of God, and sound into their ears as a voice from Heaven. A " Divine instinct" would neither be an appro- priate name for what is a gift or grace accorded to bnt few, nor would it be a more intelligible word than "special revelation." The important point, however, is not whether the faith of Abraham should be called a Divine instinct or a revelation - what we wish here to insist onis that that instinct, or that revelation, was special, granted to one man, and handed down from him to Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, to all who believe in the God of Abraham. Nor was it granted to Abraham entirely as a free gHft. Abraham was tried and tempted before he was trusted by God. He had to break with the faith of his fathers; he had to deny the gods who were worshipped by his friends and neighbours. Like all the friends of God, he had to hear himself called an infidel and atheist, andl in our own days he would have been looked upon as a madman for attempting to slay his son. It was through special faith that Abraham received his special revelation, not through instinct, not through abstract meditation, not through ecstatic visions. We want to know more of that man than we do, hut, even with the little we know of him, he stands before us as a figure second only to One inthe whole history of the world. We see his zeal for God, but we never see him contentious. Though Melchizedek worshipped God under a different name, invoking Him as Eliun, the Most Hligh, Abraham at once acknowledgeed in AMelchizedek a worshipper and priest of the true God, or Elohim, and paid him tithes. In the very name of Elohim we seem to trace the conciliatory spirit of Abraham. Elohim is a plural, though it is followed by the verb in the singular. It is generaUy said that the genius of the Semitic languages countenances the use of plurals for abstract conceptions, and that when Jehovah is caled Elohim, the plural should be translated by "the Deity." We do not deny the fact, but we wish for an explanation, and an expla- nation is suggested by the various phases through which, as we saw. the conception of God passed in the ancient history of the Semitic mind. Eloah was at first the name for God, and as it is found in all the dialects of the Semitic family except the Pice-
			nmciain (kenan, p. bil), it may probably be considered as the most ancient name of the Deity, sanctioned at a time when the original Semitic speech had not yet branched off into national dialects. When this name was first used in the plural, it could only have signified, like every plural, many Bloahs, and such a plural could only have been formed after the various names of God had become the names of independent deities-i. e., during a polytheistic stage. The transitiou from this into the monotheistic stage could be effected in two ways -either by denying altogether the existence of the Elohim, and changing them into devils, as the Zoroastrians did with the Devas of their Brahmanic ancestors, or by taking a higher view, and looking upon the Elohim as so many names, invented with the honest purpose of expressing the various aspects of the Deity, though in time diverted from their original purpose. This is the view taken by St. Paul of the religion of the Greeks when he came to declare unto them " Him whom they iWgrantly worshiipped," and the same view was taken by Abraham. 'Whatever the names of the Elohim, wor- shipped by the numerous clans of his race, Abraham saw that all the Elohim were meant for God, and thus Elohim, comprehending by one name everything that ever had been or could be calledDivine, became the name with which the monotheistic age was rightly inaugurated,-a plural, conceived and con- strued as a singular. Jehovah was all theElohim, and thereforo there could be no other God. From this point of view the Semitic name of the deity, Elohim, which seemed at first not only ungrammatical but irrational, becomes perfectly clear and inteUigible, and it proves better than anything else that the true monotheism could not have risen except on the ruins of a polytheistic faith. It is easy to scoff at the gods of the heathen, but a cold-hearted philo- sophical negation of the gods of the ancient world is more likely to lead to theism or atheism tban to a belief in the One Living God, the Father of aU mankind,-"who hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth; and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habita- tion; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of uB: for in Him we live, and move, and have our beinAg; as certain also of your owu poets have said, For we are also His off- spring."
			Taking this view of the historical growth of the ide'a of God, many of the difliculties which LI. Renan has to overcome by most elaborate and sometimes hair-splitting arguments, disappear at once. BLI. Renan, for instance, dwells much on Semitic proper names in which the names of the deity occur, and he thinks that, like the Greek names Theodorus or Theodotus, instead of Zeno- dotes, they prove the existence of a faith in one God. We should say they may or may not. As Devada&amp;ta, in Sanskrit, may mean either " given by God," or "given by the gods," so every proper name which lI. Renan quotes, whether.of Jews, or Edomites, Ishmaelites, Ammonites, RLoabitez, and Themanites, whether from the Bible, or from Arab
			historians, from Greek authors, Greekinscriptiorz, the Eg,yptian papyri, the HQimyaritic and Sinaitic inscriptions andancient coins, are. all open to two
			may be interpreted as the name-of a supreme deity; I and that Alilat, mentioned by the same traveller, should be taken, not as the name of a goddess, but as a feminine noun expressive of the abstract sense of the deity. Herodotus says distinctly that Oro tal was a deity like Bacchus; and Alilat, as ho trans- lates her name by obpav77, must have appeared to hiimself as a goddess, and not as the Supreme Deity. One verse of the Koran is sufficient to show that the Semitic inhabitants of Arabia worshipped not only gods, but goddesses also. "Whatthinkye of Allat, al Uzza, and Ma2amh, that other third goddess ?" If our view of the development of the idea of God be correct, we can perfectly unIerstandhow, in spito of this polytheistic phraseology the primitive intuition of God should make itself felt from time to time, long before MVohammed restored the belief of Abra- hamin one God. The old Arabic prayermentioned by Abulfarag may be perfectlygenuine:-"Ide- dicate myself to thy service, 0 God ! Thou hast no compamon, except thy companion, of whom thou art absolute master, and of whatever is his." The verse pointed out to M. Renan by ML Caussin de Pereeval from the lIoallaka of Zoheyr, was certainly anterior to Mohammed:-" Try not to hide your secret feelings from the sight of Allah; Allah knows all that is hidden." But these quotations serve no more to establish the universality of the monotheistic instinct in the Semitic race than similar quotations from the Veda would prove the
			existence of a conscious monotheism among the ancestors of the Aryan race. There too we read, "Agei knows what is secret among mortals" (Ri4, Vees, viii. 39, 6); and again, "He, the upholder of order, Varina, Bits down among his people; he, the wise, Sts8 there to govern. Flrom thence psrceiving aU wondrous things, he sees w-hat has been and what wil be done." (Max whuler, Histo7y of AhCi.177t Sandskrit fiteratilre,
			page 363.) But in these very hymns, better t.han| anywhere else, we learn that the idea of supremacy and omnipotence ascribed to one god did by no means exclude the admission of other gods, or names of God. MI1 the other gods disappear from the vision of the poe� while he addresses his own God, and he only who is to fulfil his desires stands in full light before the eyes of the worshipper as the supreme and only God.
			The science of critical Theology is only just beginning, and we must take care how we impede its progress by preconceived notions or too hasty generalizations. During the last fifty years the authentic documents of the most im- portant religions of the world have been recovered in a most unexpected and almost miraculous manner. We have now before us the canonical books of Buddhism; the Zendavesta of Zoroaster is no longer a sealed book, and the hymns of the Rig- Veda have revealed a state of religion anterior to the first beginningsof thatmythologywhich in Homer andfHesiodstands before us as amouldering ruin. The soil of Mesopotamia has given back the very images once worshipped by the most powerful of the Semitic tribes, and the cuneiform inscriptions of Babylon and Nineveh have disclosed the very prayers ad- dressed to Baal or Nisroch. With the discovery of these documents a new era begins in the study of theology. We begin to see more clearly every day what St. Paul meant in his sermon at Athens. But as the excavator at Babylon or Nineveh, before he ventures to reconstruct the palaces of these ancient kingdoms, sinks his shafts into the ground slowly and circumspectly lest he should Injure the walls of the ancient palaces which he is disinterring; as he watches every corner-stone lest he mnistake their dark passages and galleries, and as he removes with awe and trembling the dust and clay from the brittle monuments lest he destroy their outlnes, and obliterate their inscriptions, so it behoves the student of the history of relicion
			to set to work carefully, lest he should miss the track, and lose himself in an inextricable maze. The relics which he handles are more precious than the ruins of Babylon; the problems he has to solve are more important than the questions of ancient chronology; and the substructions which he hopes one day to lay bare are the world wide foundations of the eternal kingdom of God.
			W.le look forward with the highest expectations to the completion of M. Renan's work, and though English readers will differ from many of the author's views, and feel offended nowv and then by hisB blunt and independent language, we doubt not that they will find his volumes both instructive and suggestive. They are written in that clear and bril- liant style which has secured to M. Renan the rank of one of the best writers of French, and which throws its charm even over the dry and abstruse in- quiries into the grammatical forms and radical ele- ments of the Semitic languages.

			.PUBLIC BXAMINBR,3AN.D !PIIEIR CRBIICS.
			TO TIHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-The Civil Service Commissioners and the Board of MIilitary Education do not appear just now to repose on a bed of roses. Their duties, which they are admitted to discharge with admirable firm- ness and fidelity, are necessarily the cause of bitter disappointment to many; and the friends of those who are thus disappointed seem determined to re- taliate upon them. They are themselves quite right not to attempt either to ward off or reply to these attacks; for, were they to do so, they would have very little time left for the duties of the important offices which they so worthily fill.
			The attacks made upon them emanate chiefly from two quarters. Many of those who have been hitherto accustomed to dispense the patronage of the State find its value sadly diminished by the vigilance with which the Commissioners are exercis- ing their functions; they therefore endeavour to ridicule a-nd discredit the arrangements of these gentlemen as pedantic and overstrained, and suggest that, instead of subjecting candidates for public em- ployment to such absurd educational ordeals, it would be far better to aUow the chiefs of departments to select young men on their own individual responr- sibility.
			I would recommend this class of objectors to read with attention the recently-published Papers relati7g to Japan; they will there see how far the recom- mendations and vouchers of even Secretaries of State are to be depended upon for the capacity and education of the young friends for whom they desire to provide at the cost of the public.
			The other class of enemies who persecute the Com- missionerr are those who have been disappointed, either personally or through their protMgjs, in conse- quence of the supposed severity of the public ex- aminations. This classis, indeed a formidable one, possessing wide, though hidden, ramifications; and there is scarcely a single stone cast at the public examiners which is not more or less metiv6 by some misadventure or other which has befaUen some ill- educated alspirant for official or military life.
			At the present moment a great ran is being made against the alleged abstruseness and difficalty of the questions propounded to candidates at the com- petitive examinations for the higher branches of the Indian Service.
			The critics appear to forget that the height of the standard at a competitive examination must depend entirely upon the powers of the competitors. If the Jockey Club were to rule that, for fear of over- straining them, three-year-olds starting for the Derby were not to run at a greater pace than 12 miles an hour, we should possess no means of arriving at the only result for which these races were insti- tuted-viz., of ascertaining which were the speediest and stoutest horses of the year.
			Theprizes awarded at theseIndian competitions are great, and the men who compete for them are pre- cisely the same class of men who have hitherto com- peted for the highest honours at our Universities. After six years spent in earnest and successful study at our best schools they have aone up to college well prepared, and have made the�best of their opportu- nities there. When such stadents as these enter into open compefition with each other for such prizes, the struggle must necessarily be a serious one; it is no child's play for either examiners or examined, and it requires al the energy and all the ability of the ablest men in England to frame and conduct examinations which shall bring out fairly for comparison end judgment the stores of know- ledge which the competitors have been diligently
			acquiring during 10 of the most teachable years of
			- ow-t-Li quaite conceivable- that to Cnic3 who
			have been imperfectly educated themselves, or who have been engaged for years in the active strug- gles of business or politica, awayfrom books, the ques- tions objected to and sneered at may appear pedantic and ill-chosen; but to the best pupils of oar best schools and colleges, who are the men from among whom the Indian Council desire to obtain recruits, they are reasonable and intelligible enougth.
			It has been complained that., so difficult is the -e,t to which candidates are subjected, not more than t19 students have presented therasives to compete for 40 appointments. This Is iVty easily explained. At school and at col!ege the comparative abilities of the varioft stuacnts are pretty well aserrtaineo by means of ths lecture-rooms and the perioaical school and college examinations. There is nothing more unsatisiactory or discouraging in seein- only 119 candidates enter for 40 prizes than in seeing but 20 or 30 horses start for the Derby or Oaks. Hun dreds of others have been brad, named, entered, trained, and found wanting before coming to the post, and have wisely left the race to the few who have previously proved themselves in private trials worthy competitors for those blue ribands of the Civil Service.
			Much fun, too, has been poked at the ex- aminers for the Indian Civil Service on account of the questions which they propoind; and easy writers are constantly asling, with satirical glee, whether a youth is likely to do better public eervice in Oudh because he is an adept at the composition of tragic trimeters in a dead language, or whether a captain of horse will be assisted in the conduct of his troop by the faculty of writing a life of Zisca in forty minutes.
			Questions such as these are but poor fare after all, and they betray unpardonable ignorance on the part of the querists. It has been agreed on all sides that examinations for admission into our public service ought not to be special-that thev
			ought to be altogether based on the know- ledge usually imparted to general students at our best schools and colleges. The fairness of such an arrangement is obvious. If we had required proficiency in the Indian languages as a condition for firat admission into our Indian Service, the 79 unsuccessful candidates out of the 119 who have lately competed would have been compelled to waste a couple of years in mastering a difficult acquirement which vould now be perfectly useless to chem. It is, therefore, far better to examine them only in those acquirements which form part of the regular busine3s of education at our great schools and UJniverslti;; and that is precisely what the C'ivil Service Commissioners have done and are doing. But the parties who criticize them appear not to be conversant with the nature of the hig'her examination papers at Oxford and Cambridge; and their igno- rance has led them into blaming and ridiculing
			eTninene ann uprigne, puouc servants tor carrying out a very painful and trying duty capably and con- scientiotusly.
			I happen to have before me at this moment the papers descriptive of the examinations held this last ChriBtmnis at Charterhouse. The class of boys for whose examination they were drawn up are precisely the class who will, after two or three years' further study at our Universities, compete for Indian ap- pointments; and the questions have been pre- pared, not by Civil Service Examiners, but by the very schoolmasters who have educated them, and who therefore know what may be fairly required of them. I copy a very few in each branch of study:-
			"1. Divinity.-Place all the prophets in chronological order, mentioning the kings with which each are cotempo- rary.
			"Give some account of Ignatins and Polycarp.
			"What appears to have been the deslgn of the Book of Tob? Relate his history, and state when he is supposed to have lived.
			" Latin and Greek.-Translations from English authors into Latin and Greek. Translations from Juvenal, Terence, Virgil, Tacitus, Homer, AEsshylus, Thucydides, Aristopha- nes, and Plato into English, wvith short ilinstrative notes. Two passages of English poetry to be rendered into Latin eleglacs and hexameters, and one into Greek trimeter iambies. A Latin epigram, to be written on a given subject.
			" Critical and Grammatical Qaestions.-Characterize briefly the four principal Greek dialects. How does the Greek of Homer stand related to them ?
			" State briefly the defects of the Latin verb as compared with the Greek; and give examples of the contrivances by which they are obviated in practice.
			" Antiquities.-Describe the ,SXi as instituted by Clisthenes, its finactions and power.
			" Describe the situation of Carthage; its population and Government at the beginning of the Panic Wars.
			" Greek and Roman History.-State the functions and power of the Roman Senate,-1. Home affairs; 2. Foreign; 3. Judicial proceeedings.
			" Draw a plan of Syracuse. State the causes w hich led the Athenians to attempt the invasion of Sicily and its re- sults.
			" Aodemn History.-Sketoh the characters of Bothlwell, Darnley, Cecil, the Earl of Essex, Henri lV.
			" What do you know of Hiugh O'Neil, Jacaues Clement, Lord Mountjoy, Felton, Coligni, Aseham ? -
			" Give the more prominent instants of the weaknesses in- herent in the character of Queen Elizabeth."
			These are but a few of the shorter questions taken at random from the examination papers I have named. The pupils appear also to have been subjected to very high trials in Euclid, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, as well as in French. In the latter I find the following:-
			" Contrast briefly the times and w;ritings of Bossnet and Voltaire; convert 90 deg. Pahrenheit into Centigrade and Ileanmor degreee; sketch from mnemorya map of France, and give the dates of the treaties that have been signed at Troycs, Ca.teau, Cambresis, Paris, and Amiens,"
			The beet of the young men who at 17 and 18 are capable of undergoing creditably such an examina- tion of which the above is a specimen, form the class of candidates who compete for these Indian appoint- ments, after someyears' further stady at our Univer- sities. If there are objectionis to such a course of education-and there very probably may be-let the critics who are now attacking the Civil Service Commissioners attack the heads of our great schools and Universities on the subject, and I doubt not they will be readily answered and well answered; but let them not continue to riu down and deride able men who are faithfully and efficiently discharging the duties they have undertaken in the only way in which they can possibly be carried out.
			Lord de Ros has, I see, published a second edi- tion of his pamphlet, complaining of the exorbi- tant tests to which the Board of Military Education exposes candidates for commissions. If his Lord- ship will refer to the Appendix to the first Report of that Board, be will see that those tests have been constructed with the assistance and by the advice of the masters of Eton, Westminster, Harrow, Vin- chester, King's College, London, and Rugby; that they have been constructed expressly for the exami- nation of boys of avcrage industry and intellect; and that the only complaint raised against them by these experienced educationists is that they are so low as to encourage idleness. Surely his Lordship would not desire that any portion of our army should be officered by gentlemen of less than average industry and intellect.
			I am, Sir. vour obedient servant.
			J.' 0.

The fun, however, was too good to be long kept secret, and It turns out that the whole affair is a scandalous hoax, most cleverly carried out, the actors being a set of fun-loving clerks from York, whose" characters' must have cost them somcda4ys of study and prYt; .-;; -. i7 s fner.

			THR RGELIGIO US DISS 3SIO-^^ i'ST. GROBGZT,
			oR'THE-RAS7.
			yesterday the serviess ar St. GeOrge's-n-tho-East were More pacific than on E-a'er Sunday, although there were not more than a dozsc policemen to keep order. It was evi. dent that a large number of persons who sympathized with the rector were in attendance; so nunierous indeed were they that they completely overpowered these who attempted to interrnpt the service bysaying tho re3ponsss in opposition to tho choIr.
			The Second Commandment, and other portions oE the seo. vice which referred to graven images, were coughed and jeered at, but no serious Interruption was offered to the prayers.'
			The l;ev. Frederick George Leo, S.C.L., of Oxford, whc preached, encountered a good deal of opposition, in conse- quenco of the character- of his sermon. He selected for his text the 25th and 26th verses of the 11th chapter of St. John's Gospel,-` I am the resurrection and the life? he that. beUeveth in me, though he wvere dead, vet shall he live, and whosoever lveth and believeth inmeshallneverdie." Inthe course of his sermon ho alluded in somewhat severe terms to the proceedings inthat church during the past 10 months. -Ho had doubts in his own mind, end ietts which he had re= colved, and which the rector of that parish had received, from conscientious Dissenters from the Church of England, confirmed these doubts, as to the prlnclples which had ac-
			~uo'u Fuusroapersons wno naa causea tif interruptionz there. His rev. friend the rector adhadto contendagaInab many dlifficulties. He had been -at aside apparently by the authorities that be. The civil authorities did not seem to countenance him ; the ecclesiastical authorities alsD seemed to throw him overboardL But would any or all of those men wvho now scouted those opinicns, and attempted to put down those ideas which now seemed to be so repr,g. nant to public feeling, zsCt So when they came to apply t sir minds to the text which he bad selected, and which un- mistakably told them that they had to account to a higher Being for every act they did in the world? Far while Christ said, " I ain the resurrection and the life, and hu that believeth in me though he were dead shall live," that was grounded upon the hope of our faith in Christ, and on His power to save. Ele held that the authorities had nob done their duty in respeet of this matter, and he de5ed any judge to say that the rector, an unprotected man, had not, been attempted to be hunted down asnd persecnted by a
			uesperaw aint unprinciplec smoo.
			These personal allusions called forth repeatedhissings and other nolses.
			At 20 minutes before 7 tho gates were thrown open for the evening service. A dense crowd had assembled in Cannon-street, and in a fow minutes the church was com- pletely filled. The galleries were chiefly filled by boys and girls, while in the body of the church there were fewer roughs than on any previous occaslon. As soon as ths rector and his choristers emerged from the vestry-room there was much hissing and howling, and this was renewec
			when the rector appeared at the reading-desk for thopurpose of proceeding With the service. Ie went on withont much further interruption until he came to she Belief, when ho tearned his back upon the congregation, for which he vas greeted withlend greens, which completely drowned his voice. The Rev. Frederick George Lee voas again tho preacher. Heo selected for his test the 24th chapter of St. Ljuke's Gospel, 29th verse-"Abide w;ith us, for ft is: tow.-ards evening, and the day Is far spent." He adverted at B ome length to the progrss which the Church had made during the past 40 years, and red upon all present the duty of helping forward that greed movement. Every now and then ho was loudly hissed, bub the sermon, notwithstanding the iammense number of peopl who were present, was listened to with more than ordinar attention.
			At the close of the service there were the same tumultuous proceedings as before. People rushed towards the altar, but-
			id not make their way within the rails. They sung tho Doxology after the rector and clergy, and retlred, and lb was some timne before the few police who wore in attendance succeeded in clearing the chancel.
			The altar was decorated with flowers as on the preceding Sanday, hut the corona was not lighted.

			DISCOVERY OF ROMA-- Rntys. -Sorme very in- teresting specimens of Roman pottery have just been disco- vered at Worcester, and by a singular coincidence the dise covery has been made close to the sito of the existing cele- brated Royal Porcelain Works in tbat city. Some workmer? employed in digging in the garden of an old bowling-grem came upon some vases or jug3, most of which they broke before their nature was discovered. In the same spot were also found some decayed bones, two coins, one of which is a, brass of Domitian in good preservation, and some SAumiap ware. This discovery led to further researches, when : quantity of grooved tiles, several other vases, and an unn or red clay were exhumed. The top of the urn had been broken, and a quantity of soil had been pressed in, which had mixed with some fragmentary bones, supposed to bave been previously in the vessel. Al the relles are in tbe care of thelVorcester Archeological Club, andvarious specu- lations have been raised as to their original deposit. Thu spot where they wero found is near to the river Severn, and close to an oldtumulus,artiScially raised of sand and gratvel supposed to have been taken from the river. Tho whole o;
			this tumulus, called Castle-hill, has beenremoved vithjm to the lastc30 searsthecmud having heen sold for btopdlnv purposes, and tho gravel for roads. The va0es3have ahort

			Mr. W. EWART asked tho Secretary of tho Treasmry (in the absence of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer) whether any decision had been come to respecting the maintenance or discontinuance of the impressed stamp on newspapers.

			ave been utterly useless.

In the couLrse of the debate upon the asccnd reading of the Reform Bill be stated his belief that this return was delusive, and that the numbers shown in it were not the number of houses actually let and rented at the amount stated in the towns mentioned, but were founded upon a etatement of the number of houses which had in those dif- ferent places been estimated by local valuers at the different amounts forpurposes of rating. The difference was very material, because it was notorious that In all places the valuation upon which premises wvere rated was less than the amount for whtch they would actnally let. In support of his opinion be mentioned thatin two places-Pontefract and Newark-the number of l0f. voters upon the register was greater than the number of 101. honses Included in this re- turn. He was followed In the debate by the right hon. baronet the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,whoinformed him that he was mistaken, and attributed the discrepancy which he had pointed out to the circumstance that the scot and lot voters had been omitted from this return. Thts might be so wlth regard to Pontefract and Newark, but the fact was that there were no less than 44 boroughs in this return in regard to which the same anomaly existed, and in many of which there were no scot and lot voters. In Droitwich, for instance, there wore only a few freemen, and no scot and lot voters. The number of 101. voters on the register for that borough was 392, but thts return showeed only 327 101. houses. He believed that he had suggested the real cause of this discrepancy; and it must be evident to any one that if such was the case therealaddition totheconstituenclesunder thePeform Billwouldbemuch larger than that shownbythis return. It had also been suggested to him that in the case of persons compounding foSr gthe pdyment of the rates of a largenumber of houses the number of compounders, and not the number of tenements compounded for, had been in- serted in this return. Ele should be glad if the right hon. ,gentUeman the President of the Poor Law Board could in- em the Hoese upon both these points.
			Mr. C. P. VILIERSbelievedthathe was ina position to alLy the alarm of the right hon. baronet, and to assure him that this return was the most complete and accurate one that had ever been laid before rarliament upon a subject such as that to which it referred. The discrepancy between the number of 10!. voters upon the register and that of 10. houses was one which was very likely to exist. In many places the register had not been properly revised for many years, and there would therefore remain upon it the names of persons who were dead or disqualfied. There would also be upon It the names of others whose qualification was made up partly of a house and partly of land; and there would be in addition in some places the scot and lot voters. These three causes woul, 'he belieovfed,futlly account for the dis- the right hon. dbatro�net hhadrefeenrred. Te rihnte hon.l the property and not the persons that would bo en- titld t vot.

The returns, hrfr, were madle from the very lists which were now submitted to the re- vising banristers, and uponL which the present House of Commons was returned, but they were also drawn up, as ho had stated, with Especial reference to the persons who would he entitled to vote. Great pains had been taken to getar n of all occupiers whose rates had been com- poudedforbyther lndlrd, ad olyin a few boroughs Including some of the metropolitan boroughs, had it lcen foud Impossble to btain alist. Butt additional returns were in course of being prepared, and he had doubt that when the House resumed consideration of he efrm illitwoud hvein tsposssson full and accurate inforatn upon al points connected with the scope and effc othtmaure.
			Sir J. PAEIMTGTON said the right hen, gentleman had not given a distinct answer to his question. What he wanted to knowv was, whether the returns represented the tenements actually let at certain amounts, or the tenements whtch appeared on the rate-books estimated according to their rateable value.
			Mr. VIhLIERS thought he had alrea;y answered that question. He had stated that the retrnhs represented not only the property entered on the books of td' overseers, but thepersons who would be entitled to vote.
			Mx. e. JAMES blieved he was correct in saying that the noble lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, when he statedc that his Bai would not add more than 210,000 or 217,000 new electors to the exhting constituencies, underestimated the probable Increase by 200,000 or even 250,000. (Elear, hear.) In Norwich alone there were no fewer than 12,162 tenements rated to the ow ters instead of the occupiers, who, consequently, were not included in the returns. He believed that in his own borough 5,000 or 6 000 persons whose names did not appear on the rateo4ooks would be entitled to vote under a 6!. fran- chlse. In Finsbury the number would be 8,000 or 10,000. One landllord might own a whole street; each house might be subdivided into three or four dwellings, and, ff the landlord himself did not live in it, theo occupier of each tenemnent would be entitled to a vote. Every one of the 12,162 tenements in Norwich might pro- duce two votes, and theCourt of Common Pleas had decided that if a landlord paid the rates, the tenant was entitled to vote. He was convinceda that when the returns wore nar- rowly examined, it would be found that a 6f. fr-anchise would extend the right of voting to between 2O0,000 and 300,000 persons in addition to the number stated by the noble lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. (Hear, hoar.)
			Sir G. GREY thouight the estimate of the hon. and learned gentleman was greatly exaggerated. It proceeded in the assiumption that every man who was Included in a composi- tion would be entitled to vote under the Reform Bill. But that maeasure would enfranchise only those tenants who ocon- piedbhouses of a certainvaluLe,and who should not onlybecome Hable to the payment of rates hut should actually pay them. He reminded the right hen, member for Droitwich that a return, dated the 10th of March, had been produced since the return to which the sight hen, member had adverted was laid on the table. From this return it appeared that no less than 50 boroughis had soot and lot voters, some very few hut as great proportion very many, and he was inclined to tinic that, the majority of the 44 boroughs to which the right hen, baronet had referred were boroughs containing .oot and lot voters.
			Mr. BENTINOCK thought it impossible to overrate the importance of this matter (hear, hear), Bud he did not thinkc that any satisfactory information hadl been given to the House by the Governmenit. He hadl submitted the return on the table to a good authority, who stated that, as the franchise was to he fixedI on a 64, rental, the retur stopped short at a point where it was most desirable it should be continuedl on; and the question was raised whether the 61. rental franchise would not give the right of voting to a large number who were not rated at 614, and perhaps not at Of. so that it would be desirable to know how many were rated betwe-en 41. and 614, and how many who Inhabited tenements of 61. rental were entitledI to vote under the new Rteform Bill. As far as he was able to understand the returns presented to the House, he believed that the noble lord the member fur London was wrong in his calculation about 100 per cent. (Hear, hear.) It was Indispensable that the House, before coming to a decision on the Reform Bill, should have in its posszes- sion reliable returns, so that the House might know what it was doing, and not legislate in the dark. (Hear.)
			Sir G. LEWIS observed that it was perfectly certain that the hon. gentleman's authority either did not understaud the subject of rating, or hadl not examined the return, Inas- much as his criticism was inapplicable to it . The Govern- ment did not mean to take credit for doing what was their manifest duty, hut the return now onL the table was an at- temipt to lay before the Hfouse a complete statistial account of thebasison whichit was proposedtofeundthe newextended franchise. The Instructions for making this return were very precise and detailed, and certainy the efforts made by the Government to obtain accurte information wvere un- questionably honest and sincere. The House wouldahardly suppose that the Government had had auy sinister object in seeking for this information. (Hear hear ) The onxly in- formation 'which it was possible lor the Government to obtain was an accurate abstract of the peer-rate booksaud such the present return was. He wished thelEHouse clearly to understand 'what was the nature of that informa- tion, because it certainly wras not understood by the correspondent of the hen, gentleman. According to the existing law, the rate-hook contained twvo columns, one showing the gross estimatedl rental. That column showed, or ought to showv, the rent really paid for the tenement ; audIit was his belief that In the great majority of instances it did fairly indicate the real rentaL (Hear, hear.) Perhaps the right hen, baronet had confounded two different things. The second column represented the rate- able value upon which the rate was actually assessed, that being subject to certain legal deductions for repairs andl in- surance, so th at it was considerably reduced from the gross est-imated rental ; and It was also sometimesfurther reduced by improperdeductionsmade by overseers. Therateable value did not exhibit the rental, but the first column did in the great majority of Instances. It had been said that the return did not go low enough, and that the House did not know the total number of persons whose rental was 6f., because the rateable v-alue was lower than the rent; but be thought that it would turn out on investigation that the figures in this return in respect of the gross estimated rental of 614 would accurately represent, with the exception of tenants compounding for their rate, the total number of occupeies to that amount to be en-franchised under the Reform Bill, enbiect, of course, to further de- ductions to be made for various causes connected with the qualific-ation. With respect to those cases adverted to by te rghthon.barnet whre te nmbe ofpersons on the egiser ws graterthanthe umbe of101. house- holersas xhiite bytheretrn,Itweuld be foaund in manyinstncestha if he sot ad lt voters were de- duced he iscepac7 oul beexpaied, and the exces i oter ase msgst e oingto herauses which
			Lord STANLEY said that with respect to the borough he representedl the return gave an addit-ion by the opera- tion of the new Reform Bill of 50 peor cent, to the number of electors, but the resultbof careful local Inquiries made the addition between 90 and 100 per cent. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. MA-LINS thought it quite evident that the returns were mnade on a principle calculated to be very fallasisus. The hen, and learned member for Mlarylebone stated that aftercarefol examination theproposedBrnwouldadd450 000 electors, Instead of 220,000 to the borough ronstituencies. His rlghthon. friend (Sir J. Pakington) had received letters from various boroughs informing him that the number of electors under the Bill would be m~uch larger than that stated in the return; and the noble lordI (Lord Stanley) had de- dared that, ins-tead of 50 per cent. ,the number of. electors
			in hsboorough-wrould -hocreased-7from---to 100-per-cent. When bythesdde of thesatatementgit'wlOSremembered that the Foreign Secretary had made a stronsg impre3don on the House by affirming that hIs Bill would only add 220,000 to the borough constituencies, he aslied whether the Doint now under discusson did not raise con- siderstions of the highest possible importoe. (HEear, -hear.) The Government were making an experiment upon the con- stitution of the country which, as men of aU parties acknow- ledged, was fraught with the greatest periL ("lNo !` The lon. member for Birmingham, and those vwho agreed with him, might think that there was no dager in intrcstingthe representation to mere numbers, 'withort regard to educa- t.ien or property; but it was impeisible to go Into society or to converse w;ith lion, membersg enerally without findings3 widespread a pwprehension of the consequences which would follow from the admission of such a horde of voters. (HEar
			hear.) If then, therewas danger in giving the frawi�s to 220,000 additIonalvoters,what waS the peril whentheyfound thatthe tobtl number enranchised in boroughswould b nearer 500,000? (Hear.) The Government had, no doubt
			acted with fairness In maldng these returns, but the tact that it was the first attempt to obtain accurate information on the subject afforded conclusive evidence that the returns could not be depended upon. (Hear, hear.) He hoped the House would not be induced to take this leap in the darkon a subject in comparison with which all others that could come before them sanlk into indgnificance.
			fr. AYRTON thought that mnch of the difference of opinion which had been expressed arose from confuslng two things which were realy quite distinct. One question was as to the number of persons in the towns of England who occupied houses of 61. value. Now, in point of fact, every working man in the least degree skilled in his caling paid a rent of 2s. 6d. a-week, or over 61. a-year. Theoreti- cally therefore, ad these persons would be entitled to vote, but, in point of fact, none of them would. Take the Tower Hamlets as an example. In that borough there were 84,M0 houses, and theoreticaUy there were now 60,000 persons en- titled to vote, but in reautyunder30,000 were on the register. This was owing to the difficulties which the Bill of 1832 threw in the way of a vote, and which the present moesure perpetuated5 the result being that while, if you adopted tbe theoretical view of the case, you would find 500,000 or 600,000 persons entitled to vote In boroughs, practi- cally that number was restricted to one-fifth or one-sixth. UJnder the existing lav; no man who lived in a comIpounded houso could get a vote unless his landlord chore;* and alto- gether a very large number of persons were and would ha unable to get the votes nominally conceded to them by the ._ct of 1832 and the present measure.
			Mr. BONHAI-CAITER believed, from inquirles he had instituted, that the returns in question had been pre- pared with greater care, and were distinguished by greater accuracy, than any before made on this auestlon ; but they could only be returns of the first column of the rate-book, vhich in different parishes necessarily varied much, accord- ing to the construction of the person who levied the rate. There was no doubt a discrepancy in some of the returns, but that arose In a great measure from persons who occn- pied houses also occupying land. In some of the smaller boroughs the difference was striking. Thus in Wata h ord there were 369 persons on the register bnt only ocuopCc-
			oiers of 10t. houses. At Crwichade there were 470 persons on the register but oAsly 385e107 occpiers. The subject of compoundig was an important matter, and he hoped would receive full consideration.
			Mr. J. IOCE1E wished to know when a return upon this sabject which heghad moved for soThe weeke sice would he produced. It was most important that the House shoild know tho real number of persons ocuepying h rouses the rates for which were comdofe ded for by the landlord. As regarded the boronug of South=. warkx the Government returns were tolerably accurate, ex- cept that they had taken the register of 1853 as their guide instead of the register of 1859. The number of electors in 1858 was 10,600, but in 1859 it was upwards of 11 00D. In
			the column showing the number of houses rated at 10i. and upwards, 16,000 was ineerted leaving a differn ce of 6,0001 betweeno he number of electors and the namber of qulfy- ing houses. The expected addition to the constituency bt extending the franche to 67. occpiers was 3,000, s that the real addition to the constitueny might ha abouB 9,0D0. He wished to know whother the 200 00D incroase spoken of by the noble lord would arise only from the n.ew 6l. voters, or whether any calculation had been made of the number of those who were entited to he upon the vegister but were not there. He thought the Government ought to take care and provide a proper mashinery for the working of a new R eform Bi. There were several Corrupt Practices Bils introduced by private membors before a com- m.ittee, and it was absolutely necessary that a lReform Bill s.hould he accompanied by something of that kind to make it work. ("Hfear" and alaugh.) It would beoimnpossible to add so many olectors to the constituencios and leave them without any assistanco to enable them to vote. In the Rs.
			form Bill of the late Government there was a provision for additional polling places (hear); but in the present Bill there was nothing of thekind.
			The SPEW ER intmatod that as the Corrupt Practices Bill and tho Reform Bill were measures before the House to he discussed upon a future occasion, the hon. member was Irregular in commenting upon them at present.

			LORD-LIEUTEUNANCY OF LONDONDERRY
			COUNTY.
			Colonel FRENCH said the noble lord at the head of the Government was aware of the statement which had been made, that the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, in deh3ance of precedent and custom, had' chosen to apoont a legal func- tionary to the office of Lord-Lieutenxant -of the county of Londonderry. (Hear.) It had been etated that this legal functionary ldi not possess property In the county beyodt
			a emaiU leasehold of 100 acres, while the qualification was 2001. a-year in fee. He wished to know whether during the recess the noble lord would direct inquiries to be made whether the gentleman to whom he had referred possessed the amount of roperty necessary to qualify him for the office to which le0 had beenx appointed.
			DISFRANCMISEMENT OF BOROUGHS.
			Sir A. FARQUHAR wished to put a quesion to the noble lord which had reference to the boroughs proposed to he partially disfranchised. The House was aware that ln 1831 the Government tookthetest of population, but thatin 1832 they resolved to take the test of houses and the relative importance of boroughs, in considering the question of di-e franochisement. Lord felbourne at that time directed Lieutenant Drummond to maake seh a returnas wouldl show the rlative Importance of the boronghs, and on that return the Government of the day proceeded in their disqualifies- liens. re Ewished to know whether, seeing the preent Go- vernment had reverted to the test of 1831, instead of that of 1832, they would direct a return to be made, on the same principle as that made by order of Lord Melbourne, Of all boroughs returning two members to Parliament and con- taining less tha-n 10,000 inhabitants ? Such a return would be of the greatest possible interest, as showing the relative importance of the various boroughs. (Hear, hear.)
			Mr. DEEDES suggested to the Government that their returns would he much more perfect if they were to post- pone their measure till after the next census,'which, as a matter of course would be taken next year. (Rear, hear.) He was informed that the noble lord at the head of the Ga- vernment had Informed the House that on their reassem- bling on the 16th of April the Navy Estimates woulId be the first business taken. On referig to the notice-boak he found that the first order of the da for the 16th of April was the Eclesiastial Commission Bi, and the next the Highways BiLl. He wished to know when those meaures woulid be proceded with.
			Sir G. C. LEWIS, In reply, said neither of these Bils would be proceded with in the iDrst week after Easter- and, in rey toM.Aderma uSA.omoxs, the richt hon. gentle-
			man sai9d the Lodon Corporation Bill would not ha pro- ceeded with in that week.
			Mrx. BOVILL wis'hed to impress upon the Government the propriety of obtaining accurate returns, to show the relative importance of boroughs. The mode in which the House formerly arrived at a result on this question was by takingthe number of houses and the amouLnt of taxation ; thus, ly taking the number of houses to represent one figure and the taxation to represent another figure, a table was formed which showed the relative imaportance of all the boroughs. The returns already before the House would afford facilities for obtabining this information ; and all that was necessary was for the Gvernent to iSme8 orders to some gnlan t aeth oun, similar to those given i182by Lordl Melbourne to Lieutenant Drammond. (Hear, hear.) If this was not done by the Govemnment the consequence would be that every member would make his own calculationa on the subject. (Hear, hear.)
			Lord PALMERSTON was understood to assent to the inquiry suggested by the hon. memnber for Roscommon. With respect to the return referred to by the hon. and leamned gentleman who spoke last, it was very difficult for the Government to call for returns at the suggestion of other persons. If any hon. member chose to move for a return which was likely to throw useful lighlt on any subject that would come under the discussion of the House, the Govern- ment would, of course, offer no objection to its production.
			Sir F. SMITH asked the Secretary of State for War whe- ther he expected to be able to lay onl the table, shortly after Easter, the report of the Commissioners on the Defences of the Country.
			Mr. S, HERBERT replied In the affirmative.
			The motion for adjournment at the rising of h oz til the 16th inst, was then agreed t f thoH.s
			TREATY OF TURIN.
			Mr. KINGLAKE gave notice that on the day when Paellament reassembled he would ask the noble lord the Foreign Secretary whether, consistently wvith a duo re- gard to the pubic service, he would be able to afford the House any iformation as to the negotiations now on foot with reference to the territorial changes effeut-ed by the treaty ofTu.rIn. HealsoToroposed,at thesame time,to put a question to the noble lord arising out of the extraordtnary despatch addiressed by M. Thonvenel to Count Persigny on the 6th of March.

The hon.gentleman also gave notice, on behal of another hen, member then absent, of his intention to move, on an early day after Easter, tha't it was not expedient to remove any portion of the national col-ections In the British Museum to Brompton, unless such removal were recommendied by a committee of that.

			THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
			(From the Redlstrar-General's Weekl, ROtn?ni
			The health of London is at present far from being in a satisfactory state. Last week the mortality was exceedingly high. The deaths, which were in the firs' week of March 1,397, have during the rest of the month shown a constani- increase, for they were 1,583 and 1,611 in the two following weeks, and they further rose in the week that ended last Saturday to 1,708.
			In the 10 years 1850-59 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,3S2; but, as the deaths now returned occurred in an increased population they should be compared with the average raised in propor- tion to the inerease-namely, with 1,520. The comparlson shows that the deaths of last week were more numerous by 188 than they would have been if the average rate of mortality had rruled.
			The deaths in the present return exceed those of any cor. responding week, except that of the year 1S53, when they rose to 1,748 in consequence of the prevalence of pulmonary complaints from extreme cold, the mean temperature of the air in the previous week having been so low as 33 3 deg.
			In the last four weeks the deaths from pulmonary dis- eases, exclusive of phthisis, were 387, 450, 4S5, and 476; thoee from whooping-cough 42, 45, 62, and 72; those from phthlsis or consumption 143, 171, 167, and 202. This last disease exhibits a striking increase in last week; 100 of its victims were in the period of life 20-40 years. Bronchitis and pneumonia last week carried off respectively 272 and 1]2 persons, the corrected averages heing only 146 and 106, Seven children died from whooping-cough in the sub-dis. trict of Islngton West, 6 in that of Bow. Smallpox was fatal in 35 cases, scarlatina in 49, diphtheria in 11 Influ- enza was returned in S cases. Eleven persons, eli women except one, died at the age of 90 years and upwards, of whom one had attained the great age of 101 years. A man died in the Almshouses, Fulham-fields, at the age of 87 years, who had assisted at the victory obtained by Lord Howe on the Ist of June, 1794.
			Nine children died by accidental snffocation, 7 of these in bed. Thirteenpersons died fromneurns andascalds; avarnish- maker from turpentine taking fire ; a labourer at a dlstiUlery fell into boilng muriato of lime; a female servant was burnt when in a fit; two children of labourers, each aged 3 years, from their clotbes taking fire; also, from the same cause, the daughter of a labourer and the daughter of a general dealer; the daughter of a dock-labourer vas burnt from being left alone in the room; 5 children were burnt or scalded by means not specified in the returns.
			Last week the births of 1,018 boys and 941 girls, In a7l 1,959 children, were registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeks of the years 1850-59 the average number was 1,828.
			At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week wvas 29 378in. The rcading; fell from 290611n. on Monday, the highest in the week, to 28-62in., the lowest, on Saturday. The mean temperature of the air in the week was 4503 deg., which is 2-6 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily temperature, whlch wag below the average on the first tbree days, was above it the rest of the week, nnd on Wednesday and Thursday this excess was more than 7 deg. The thermometer in the shade fedl to its lowest point on Tnesday, 341 deg., and it rose to its highest on the following day, 59-5 deg. The range in the week was therefore 25-4 eg. The mean dally range was 12-3 deg. Lhe mean temperature of the water of the Thamaes was 46-4 deg. The differenco between the mean dow-point temperature and air temperature was 6-S deg., indicatingthe dryness of the air. The mean degree of humidlty was 79, complete saturation being represented by 100. After the first three days, when the wind was generally in the north- west, it blew from the west and south-west. On four days its mrimsm Pressure wias Sib. and 101b. on the square foot. Rain fell to the am90unt of 0 2Sln. in the week, about halif of which fell on Saturday.

			-TORY-fARBKlTarTdCItITYTINTELWIGENB.
			TutsDAfy EvxiuG.
			Ths quohatlon of gold at Paris is about at P,I and the short exchange on London is 25.124 per 1i. sterling. On comparing these rates with th&amp; Engliah Mint price of 31. 17s. Mid, per ounce Standaid, It appears that gold is about 2-lOths per ezat. dearer in Paris than in London.
			By bdvices from Hamburg the price of gold is 4 per mark, and the short exchange on London 's A.31 per 11. aterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore at about the same prlce In London and Hamburg.
			Tho course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 108k to 1081 per Cent., Which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the ex- Change Is against England. But, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmisaion of gold between the two countries.
			The statement of Lord John Russell last evening regarding the recognition of the new territories of the King of Sardinia, and of the probability of a Conference of the lowers to arrange the Swiss part of the Savoy question, caused Consols to open buoyantly this morning at an advance of an eighth, andaubsequentlytoexperience a-further ris3. The first bargains for money were at 94.j. to 4, whence there was an improvement to 944 to i, which was snpported to the official close. After regular hours, however, a reaction occurred of an eighth on the receipt of lower prices from Paris. The India RuDee Stoeks closed respectively at 97A to 98 and 103f to 104-an advance of a quarter per cent. India Stock left off at 218 to 220; India Five per Cents., 104-1; and India Bonds, 5s. discount to par. Exchequer- bills declined on a few sales to 10s. to 15s. premium, few persons being disposed to purchase them while the rate of discount is 4i per cent., and they pay only 2i per cent.
			Although to-morrow is the 4th of the month, there was a much better supply of money in the discount- market to-day.
			Foreign stocks have been rather active, and in several cases an advance has taken place. Spanish descriptions and -Mexican were especially firm, the latter being last quoted 21i to ;, while Portuguese was rather flat. Turkish Six per Cents. improved on an official contradiction of the recent reports re- garding intended loans, the old stock closing 7T8 to 7;j, and the new 601 to 61k. Brazilian Scrip has rallied to A discount to par. The general business comprised.-Brazilian Five per Cents., 1843, 100T and 100; Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 89%; ditto Scrip, j and I discount and par - Grenada Active, 15 - Deferred, 4;; Mexican, for the account, 21i, ', and i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 91k; Portuguese, 42; for the account, 421; Russian Three per Cents., 64 and I; Spanish, 46 and I;_for the account, 46, i, and i; Deferred, 34R; tor tha account, 34- , and ; Passive, 14- and ; Certificates, 4# and 4; Turkish Six par Cents., for the account, 7L&amp; and 79; New Loan, for the ac- count, 61 and 60-; Venezuela One-and-a-Half per Cents., 13 ; and DutchTwo-and-a-1a7fper Cents., 66, 6NM, and 66-.
			The closing price of French Three per Cents. to- day was 69f. 5Cc., showing a rise of nearly a quarter per cent.
			In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates on Paris and Amsterdam were slightly higher, while Hamburg shows a trifling decline.
			There was no withdrawal of gold from the Bank to-day.
			The Australasian, from New York, has brought 40,0001.; and the Tyne, from Brazil, 6,6001.
			The accounts from New York to-day describe the contlnuance of an abundant supply of money, the rate ranging between 5 and (6 per cent. The stock-market consequently remainedlfirm, and the prices of the shares of some of the Western rail- ways had reached a higher point than for six months past. The imports of goods from Europe werelarge, but the heavy draughts against cotton shipments were sufficient to meet all the requirements for re- turn remittances. It was, therefore, not expected that any considerable transmission of specie will take place to this country before May. In June and July the totals w;ill probably he very large. The general advices on this occasion throw no further light on the critical proceedings at Vera Cruz. It seemed to be taken for granted that Mliramon would be defeated, especially after the in- terruption to his combinations by the seizure of his two steamers, but it must be borne in mind that aU the accounts thus far received come from the friends of the Juarez Government.
			MIr. Wilson's minute on Indian currency, of which. the full particulars were given in The Times five weel;s back, has at leng,th been published, together with the answer of Sir Charles Wood,the President of the India CounciL With regard to Mr. Wilson's pro- posal for the issue of notes on Government secu- rities " to whatever extent shouild from time to time be deemed advisable," Sir Charles assumes that the impression it may convey is not Mr. Wilson's meaning. Be, therefore, insists that the "C ound principle" of the Bank Charter Act of 1844 shall be held in view, and that all issues beyond a certain amount shall be represented by a corresponding amount of bullion. The total note circulation of the Bank of Bengal min,ht, he considers, in the first instance be taken as the limit of the issne upon eecurities. Sir Charles is likeewise of opinion that the notes, instead of being manufactured in India, should be manufactured here, and sent out in quantities as they may be required.
			The Portuguese Government are attemptina to mitigate the effect of the recent exposure of their dealings in the matter of the railvay concession lately withdrawn from Sir Mlorton Peto and handed over to A. Salamanca. They omit, however, as is fre- quently the case in defences of this kind, to touch upon the main point at issue. The Portuguese Cabinet had a technical right to annul the concession to Sir Morton Peto, and therefore no formal com- plaint can be raised against them on that score, whatever may be the opinion of their conduct by those well-informed of the details of the case. But Sir Mlorton had a pecuniary claim for specilic ex- penses, and the allegation is that the Finance MNinister recently admitted the principle on which this claim is based, but, upon being pressed to con- firm in writing what he had stated verbally, declined taking any steps, on the plea that that it might prejudice the success of the Ministry in certain discussions pending in the Cortes. For a Government to attempt to evade, or indefinitely to postpone, a money question wvith an individual to serve political aims of its own woiuld be looked upon in England as highly discreditable, and it Is in this aspect the matter at present stands. Can the Portuguese Government give it a different face? If so. they will have an opportunity, as the claim has been placed in the hands of Lord John Russell. Meanwhile, it will be useless for them to seek to raise a cloud by taunting Sir Morton Peto with the fact that he Was willing to undertake the railway on condition of receiving Portuguese Bonds, and that it is "a contradiction in terms" for him now to say a word that would prejudice the character of these securities. The English public have no con- cern with Sir 3Morton's opinion about Portuguese credit, but if they are to be asked for further'loans they have a considerable interest in ascertsining if the Portuguese Government are at this very hour, after nll their past lapses, acting meanly and in bad faith to any one who has placed trust in them. i\loreover, even if Sir Morton has experienced a change of view, this is nothing more than com- monly cccurs with a creditor who fails to get his bill. Possibly, also, Sir Mlorton vas ignorant of the fact that Portugal has for some time past been in the habit of creating bonds and putting them from time to time on the London market with as much secrecy as possible, to avoid the honest formality of an open loan. The correctness of the belief professed by the Finance Minister, that 4,500,0001. could now be raised in London at a price, includbg aU expenses, much higherthan 33, is, of course, a point to be settled only by actual ex- periment. He considers that some measures lately introduced fb4benefiting the Portnguese revenue should lmpart confidence, but, as the first among them appears to be " the suspension of the sinking funds of all the loans," the prospect for fresh loans seems not to be rendered more inviting. Something is added about the benefits the railways themselves. will produce in the country. The railways, how- ever, have yet to be made, and when made they wiU be worked under Portuguese management. As to the increase of commerce that is talked of, we must bear in mind that the latest commercinl fact in con- nexion with Portugal is that when sbe found the English duty on her wines would be reduced, with- out any stipulation on our part, she at once denied an Intention previously attributed to her of modi-
			fying her restrictive system with respect to the admiasion of English merchandize.
			A meeting of Spani3h certificate-holders, took place to-day, Mr. J. D. Powles in the chair. A report was presented detailng at length the steps taken by the committee to obtain reparation from the Spanish Government, and containing two im- portant legal opinions recognizing' the validity of the rlghlz of the certificate-holders. One of these was from I)r. Pbillimore and the other from three of the mosteminent clviilawyers of Madrid. Since the outbreak of the war with Morocco it has been considered advisable to cease for the time from ag,itating the question, but now that peace is concIuded, and that Spain is aboat to receive a large indemnity, the moment is thought peculiarly opportune to re-open negotiations. The daily improving financial posltion of Spain, shown by the augmlentation in her revenue during the last -four years from 13 to 18 millions, i3 also stated to give a fair ground for the renewval of the applications of the certificate-holders. The annexed resolations were adopted unanimously ._
			L. That it appears to this meeting, looking to the greatly inproved condition of the finances of Spain and the nation at large, thnt the present is a suitable moment for respectfully calling the attentlon of the Spanish Govern- ment to the liqaidatlon of the arrears of Interest on the Spanish debt which had accrued in the year 1851, and which remain unpaid.
			" 2. That thts meeting desires to express in respectful terms Its hope that it will appear to the Spanish Govern- ment no less consistent with the principles of public faith than with the dignity of the Spanish nation that this liqui- dation should now be carried into effect.
			"3. That the committee of Spanish certficate-holders be requested to bring these reselutiens under the considera- tion of the Spanish Government, and that, If any difference of opinion should arise between the Spanish Government and the conmmittee as to the manner of effecting this liqui- dlation, the committee be hereby authorized to propose to the Spanish Government that the same be left to the arbi- tration of the Minicsters of any two European Governments represented at the Court of Madrid, to be mutually ap- pointed; adthat this meeting do adjourn to the f^ir-st Thursday in unne.a
			The annual court of the Company of Copperminers in England was also held to-day, Sir J. H. Pelly presiding, when a dividend at the rate of 7j per cent. was declared on the preference shares, and of 14 on the ordinary stock. It was stated that the convertible stocks at Cwm Avon on the 28-h of January, the end of the finandal year, were larger than on any previous period, and that they have been verified with more than ordinary care. No bad debts have been made in the course of the year, and of the amount appearing in the balance- sheet as owing to the company to date the principal portion has since been received. Nothing has been recovered from the sum placed to suspense account in 1858, and the whole has been written off. Some small return, however, will pro- bably be obtained. One-half of the total standing at the debit of outlay on works has been charged to the last year's revenue, and the remainder will be charged against the present. A further limited expenditure on this account wil be similarly dealt with. In answer to a question it was mentioned that an increase of 2,0001. in the consoli- dated stock on the books arises from an allotment to pay some debentures of the old company. about 5001. more may be claimed in like manner, and it is believed that this last amount can by no possibility be exceeded. The profit in the year ending January 28, 1860, was 26,9871., against 25,1301. in the previous year. The sum of 1,0391. remains unliqludated of the 5,39al. cost of the Cwvm Avon Church and schools, and the directors have agreed to mnake further subscriptions of 4131. to- wards clearing off thia balance, on condition that the proprietors contribute the remaining 62Gl.

			STATE OF TBADB.
			LEEDS, AP'RaL 3.-The woollen cloth trade, in its gene- ral cbaracter, continues rather quiet, but manufacturers are mostly In full work. The weather still continues cold, and light fabrics are longer kept from actual wear for the season than has been anticipated. Rifle cloths still se'a well; but, as nmst of them are made to order, no large quantities are offering in the markets. In the cloth-hals to-day there has been a rather. limited attendance of buyers, and less than an average amount of business was done. The demand for the foreign trade, as well as the home trade, Is rather dull. There is a good deal of caution need on all sides, Induced by the uncertain aspoect of continental affairs and other circum- stances, which It is needless to point out in this report.
			MAINCHESTER, 3D.-There was a very quiet market in yarns and spinners who are coming out of contract are in- cline to take rather lower prices. These remarks apply to yarns suited to all markets-those of India, China, Germany, the Mediterranean, and home trade. Buyers for the Conti- nent are still actuated In suspending operations by the poli- tical news lately current, though the feeling from this source Is scarcely marked by so much messiness as ib was last week. Inclothsthere is no change, eitherastobusiness or prices. The mnarketisquiet and dull, partly owving to the higher rates of discount and partly through the absence of either letters or telegrams from India; hutbuyers areunableto get any advan- tagein pHices,manufactasrersappearing to be still fullycengaged w.ith contracts of more or less standing, while there are no stocks in baud to affect the market. The India advices are now overdue, and their arrival is looked for somewhat anxiously. Cloths for other markets than India are also steady. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report " There is no change to report In the market since Tuesday last. Owing to the uneasy feeling with regard to Continental polltles, to the advance In the rate of discounts, and to the absence of further advices from India, now overdue, buyers generally are holding back, and the amount of business doing is alto- gether Inconsiderable. hs a rule, however, manufacturers
			are well engaged, and adhere firmly to the highest rates lately curent." In their review of the market during the past month Messrs. Robert Freeland and Brother, in their circular issued this day, observe :-" Dosing the first three weeks of the month our market was comparatively inactive, there being very little fresh busi- ness tranasacted, and prices yielded about 21 per cent. Within the last 10 days, however, there has been an active demand for India and China, and for goods adapted to those markets quotations are now on a par with those at the be- "inning of the month. There has been more irreguarity in Some-trade makes during the month than has been observ- able for some time, and where contraots have expired there Is great anxiety on the part of the manufacturers to renew them at a concession in priee. This remark applies more particularly to 9-Sths printing cloths. The total ship. ments of cotton piece goods acr yarns for the month have been 95,146 packages against 100,683 for the same time tast year. To Calcutta tacy amount to 24,414 agalnst 20,716 same timelast year; and to Bombay 3,187, against 9.240. The average for the Previous twelve months is 19,297 and 13,379 respectively. To China shipments are continued on a large scale-5,765 pack-ages to Honkong and 3,921 to Shanghai. The following classification shows how the months shipmnents have bee n distributedl
			ROOEDALE, 2D.-There has been a qntet market for wools to-day, and a comparatively small amount of busi- ness has been done. GeneraUy, prices are the same as last week. Plannels are firm In price, and afair amount of business has been done ta-day but merchants rather bang off giving any advsncowv;hlch i3 demanded by manufacturer upon late prices. Linseys are scarcely so good of sale as they wecre, nor are the heavy Yorkshir goods; but Lanca- shire and Sa,xony flannelsJ and most other goods, sell steadily. The manufacturers continue well employed.
			LrVERPOOOL CoTTro2'-i RMIAr, April3.-The demand for cotton continues flmit4d, and this day's transactioas barely reach 5O000 bales-2,O00 on speculation and for ex- port. Prices irregular. '

			RAILWAY, MTNI.NG, and OTHBR SHARES.
			TuisDAY EvENmG.
			The railway-market has again been very firn, and, though scarcely closing at the best, shows an ad- vance of i to 31 per cent. Midland and Great Northern A stocks present the principal improve- ment. As for some time past, any importaut reac- tion in this department arises from speculative sales, and, the public investing at the decline, a rapid recovery takes place upon the least reassuring feature. The continuous improvement in traffic also exercises a favourable effect. At 4 o'clock Lon- don and North-Western was quoted 98* to i ; Nlidland, 1161 to 117, after having been 117, buyers, Lancashire and Yorkshire, 102i to aft Great Western, 68i to i; South-Western, 92j to i; North British, 60 to 61 ex. div.; Great Northern, 111k to 112; ditto A, 114 to 116 ; Caledonian, 904 to i ; and Sheffield, 42* to 1. The colonial-market has been less buoyant than the home, but several Indian guaranteed descrip- tions are slightly higher. Grand Trunk of Canadi stock has also advanced 1 per cent.; to 35 to ,; and Great Western shares an eighth, to, 13 to J. French railways have improved. Lombardo-Vene tian were likewise firm in the morning, but sub- sequently went to 11 pm., or the same as yester- lay. Bahia left off I dis. to par; and San Paulo - to J dis. American railway securities were steady. Mines were dull, and in one or two cases the closing quotations show a decline. There has been a good demand for joint-stock bank shares, especially London and Westminster and Ottoman, both of which have advanced. No change of importancetookplaceinmiscellaneous descriptions. Victoria debentures, new, improved to 107* to J ex div. The Canadian Loan was last quoted 1l to A pm. scrip, and 100k to J bonds; Ocean r4arine Insurance, 3 pm.; Universal, i to I pm.; London and Provin- cial, J to i pm.; and Bank of Turkey, 1l to 1* dis.

			DUBLIN AND WICKLOW
			An extraordinary neeting of this company was held on Fi day In Dublin, the Hon. G. Hancock in the chair.
			The Solicitor read the heads of a Bill for the modification of the lease of the Dublin and Elngstown Rallvway to the Dublin and Wicklow Company, and for regulating the capital of the Dublin and Kingstown Company.

			LERTHTh, TREDEGAR, AND ABERG&amp;VEINNY.
			"a aujouruocE nail-yearly meeting was held at Aber- gavenny on Monday, Mr. 0. Bailey, M.P., in the chair.
			The CHAThMA?i stated that he had gone carefally over the estlmates of lir. Gardner, the engineer, and from his knowledge of the country and its great faciities in the articles of lime, stone, and other materials necessary for the construction of a railway, as well as from his practlcal ac- quaintance with the price of work in the locality,
			e had been able to reduce the estimates, and Mr. Gardner had agreed to his views. He had proposed to one of the contractora the terms of the directors, and they had been acceded to within about 1,0001., so that there was every probability that the contrast would be speedily taken at lower prices than were at first antielpated. For the first section, from Abergaveony to Brynmawr, a distance of 91 miles, the contract would be 6,0001. per mile, exclusive of stations and sidings. A positive assurance w as given that there was no trath in the suppesitlon that the directors intended to construct the line only as far as Brynmaw/r.
			Ir. Thomas Brown, of the Ebbw Vale Ironworks, and MTr. Isaac Isaaes, of Abergavenny, were elected directors, and the salary of the secretary (MIr. Batt) was fix;ed at 230r gumneas per annum.
			A vote of thanks to the chairman closed the proceeaings.

			I LONDON, WEDNESDAY, APrL 4, 1860.
			The Houne of Lords met yesterday at 3 o'clock, when the Royal assent was given by commission to the Income-tax and Stamp Dnties Bil, and, having adjourned for a short time, met again at 5 o'clock, transacted no business of public importance, and finally adjourned for the Easter holydays at half- past o'eclock.
			In the House of Commons, on the motion, by Lord PAmSxaszow, that the House at its rising do adjourn til Monday, the 16th,
			Sir J. PA;oGToN asked in what manner the num. bers of houses at varions amounta of " gross estl- mated rental" in the cities and boroughs of i3ngland (as given in the return upon the table) were ascer- tained, complaining that the return was erroneous and delusive.
			Mr. V1TT.s asmured Sir JoHN that the retaun was complete and accurate, and pointed out what he
			considered to be the sources of the misapprehension upon which he had impugned the return.
			31r. JAMrES believed that, if the retnrn was nar- rowly looked at, there would be an increment of the franchbse to the extent of between 200,000 and 300,000 voters, in addition to the 217,000 estimated by Lord J. RussELL.
			The subject underwent further discussion, which extended to the Reform Bill, and additional expla- nations o' the return were given by Sir G. GuaLr and Sir G. LEwis, who said it was the first attempt to obtain accurate returns in this matter, and it had been made with the greatest care and the most per- fect sincerity.
			Other topics were introduced into the discussion. The motion for adjournment was at length agreed
			to.
			Mr. HExEss&amp;y obtained leave to bring in a Bill to facilitate the improvement of land in Ireland.
			Mfr. E. BouvzarE moved for leave to introduce a Bill to abolish the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts in Ireland in cases of defamation, and In England, Scotland, and Ireland in cases of brawling.
			After some remarks by Sir G. LEwis and Colonel FRENCH, leave was given.
			The Select Committee on Miscellaneous Services was nominated.
			The House went into Committee on the remain- ing clauses of the Adulteration of Food and Drink Bill, which were agreed to, with amendments.
			The Report on the Customs Acts was brought up and agreed to.
			The Customs Bill was committed pro form.
			The House adjourned at a quarter to 6 o'clock til londay, the 16th of April.

			The rules for the internal arrangement of the House of Commons may appear to many persons matter of smaU consequence and little interest, except to those whom those rules immediately con- cern. This vrould, however, be a very serious mistake. Fo- good or for evil, the House of Commons had contrived to take into its hands the whole business of the country. It makes our laws, it nominates our Executive Government, it regulates our finances, it imposes our taxes, and, in addition to all these functions, it has lately taken on itself to discuss and to deliver the most unqualified opinions upon the politics of Europe. The manner in which such a body arranges its business and disposes its tine cannot possibly be a matter of indifference to those whose actions it regulates, whose money it spends, and whose opinions it undertakes to represent.
			In order to understand the change which was effected last Monday we must offer a brief ex- planation of the business which has to be done, and the manner in which that business ia got through. The House of Commons sits during the Session five days in the week, of which two are popularly said to belona to the Government and three to independent members. This division, however, by no means expresses the real truth of the case. It would be more correct to say that the House, having five days a-week at its disposal, devotes two of those days to that portion of its business which is absolutely indispensable, and three to that other portion which, however im- portant it may be, can be set aside without bringing public affairs to a standstil. If what is caUed Government business be postponed or neglected, there is no remedy for it but that the House should sit til it has been disposed of. Here, then, to begin with, is a very striking fact. Nothing is more bitterly complained of than the exorbitant length of the Session, and yet towards the transaction of that business upon which the length of the Session depends tbe House can only allot two days out of five, leaving three other days for business which has no such tendency. The Government must out of those two days find time for all the business connected with the financial statement, for al the examination of the Estimates in detail, and for all, or nearly all, the legislation of the year, for it has come to be an axiom that no Bill of importance can be carried unless the Government takes it ulp. If we were to pause here, we think that we should be entitled to say that the first Representative Assembly in the world manages its business on principles which no assembly, ancient or modern, and no meeting of gentlemen collected together for any purpose, public or private, would for a moment tolerate. But we have by no means done justice yet to the strange manner in which it is the pleasure of the House of Commons to squander the time which it ought to economize, and stint the discussions it ought to encourage. From these two-fifths of its time which it alots to the real business of the Session the House makes many and serious deductions. In the first place, there is the privilege of every member to bring forward any question he pleases, and speak upon it at any length he pleases, on going into Committee of Supply-a privilege which very frequently abstracts four or five hours from the 14 hours a-week allowed to Government business. Then there is the claim of every mnember who has a charge to bring against the Government to have a night given him for the purpose,which often effects another serious diminu- tion. Then there is the so much discussed motion for adjournment on Fridays, which may be said to deprive the House every week of at least one- fourth of the time devoted to indispensable business.
			It is easy to trace the result of these strange ar- rangements. Independent members enjoy a super- abundance, while Government suffers under the most miserable scantiness, of time for the discus- sion of its business. The measures of first-rate importance must, of course, have a hearing, but most of what may be caUed second-rate legislation never practically gets a hearing at alL It is brought on after 12 o'clock at night, when an understanding prevails that nothing opposed shall be gone on with. The condition of success, there- fore, is not that the measure shall be found good after a careful examination, but that it shaH be of such a nature as to provoke no opposition at alL There is only one way to protect a measure from opposition; that is, to strike out al its dis- putable parts, and tone it down to a state in which nothing is left to object to. Opposition in these cases cannot be overcome, and must therefore be anticipated. A long list might be given of measures excellently conceived and carefully prepared, which, simply because they could not be discussed before 12 o'clock, have been dep-.ived of all their characteristic merits, and reduced to a state in which, in order not to provoke the hostility of their enemies, they resign all claim to the sympathy and support of their friends. For the same cause, even on measures which do attain the privilege of being debated, the discussion is left to a great degree in the hands of their opponents, because the friends of the Bill know that the best service they can do is to be silent, and not, by arguing In its defence, encroach upon the little time that can ba allowed for its consideration; but the time arrives at last when even this method of doing business becomes impossible. After having lounged over the first four months of the Session, the time comes, generally at the beginning of June, when it is necessary that an effort should be made to wind up the business of the year. A third day-Thursday-is then generally handed over to Government; but even this concession, which, if made earlier, might have done aU that is wanted, is no longer sufficient, and the device of morning aittings is resorted to-that is to say, during the three hottest months of the year, June, July, and August, the House of Commons com- mences its sittings at noon, and, with an interval of two hours for dinner, continues them till 2 or 3 in the morning. Oommittees, private and public,
			are at the same time in full activity. The division bell summonses the breathless Committeemea from their inquiries, which the announcemeut of the numbes dismisses them to resume, till they are once more rung in to decide on questions the argu- ments for and against which they have never heard, and of the very terms of which they are often ignorant. Can it be wondered that a system such as we have described should often lead to un- satisfactory results, or, rather, is it not surprising that its results are not even more unsatisfactory than they are ?
			What becomes, in the meanwhile, of the three days allotted to independent members ? Tuesday and Thursday are allotted to Motions, Wednesday to the passing of Bills, which, if dis- pleasing to any large number of members, are often defeated by the questionable device of speak- ing against time, and which, if they are to pass at all, must be taken out of the hands of their pro- posers and adopted by the Government. Tuesday and Thursday are given to MIotions, and cases over and over again decided, stale claims, and unreal grievances are again and again brought before the House in successive ses- sion. The discussion is languid, the attend- ance is thin, and the most eminent raembers of the House are generally absent. Indeed, it is not uncommon to find it cut short by a count-out. The only portion of the time of the House allotted to independent members which seems to us generally to produce interesting and animated discussions, is that which is given to the debate on the adjournment from Friday to "Monday. Then all the scores of the week are cleared off, all the salient topics of the day receive notice, and in the course of some three or four hours matters of more interest to the public are treated of than in al the rest of the week. So convenient has this form of discussion been found, that while, on the one hand, it has seriously encroached on the pri- vilege of asking questions of Ministers on ordi- nary nights, it has, on the other hand, very much prevented the practice of making formal motions, and has thus reduced Tuesday and Thurs- day to the languid state we have described. But this practice of speaking on the adjournment, so useful and convenient in itself, is a dreadful inroad upon the time allotted to the indispensable business of the Session. The convenient practice has been preserved and the Inconvenience ob- viated by a very simple expedient. The House has resolved to assign Government business to Thursday, and to give Friday, with its motion for adjournment, to independent members. This ought to satisfy all parties. It wil give Govern- ment four or five hours a-week more for the trans- action of necessary business, and it wiU preserve a practice far too convenient to be given up, and which, under the appearance of wasting, really, by the formal motions it prevents, economizes the public time. But we are satisfied that this charnge, although good as far as it goes, is by no means sufficient, and that by a more judi- cious economy of its time it is in the power of the House of Commons not only materially to liglten its own labours, but to give increased facili- ties to discussion, and by that means to improve the quality and the usefulness of its legislation. The whole subject should be reconsidered, suf- ficient time sbould be allotted for the necessary business of the Session, and the disgraceful expe- dient of compensating by a spasmodic and over- strained diligence for former remissness and indolence should be avoided.

			M. T.ouvENf.L draws breath and answers faintly that the reply of the British Cabinet to his despatch is not a protest. Thereupon he is much eased, and hopes the affair may be considered as over. That stage of feeling is familiar to English tribunals. A Judge tells the prisoner at the bar what he thinks of his conduct. He speaks as Judges can speak, and as a man who respects himself would rather not be spoken to. At last the prisoner hears the words " You are "discharged," and accordingly walks out of eourt with the feeling that perhaps, on the whole, he would have been more comfortable with six months' imprisonment, or a flogging, or any- thing that squared his debt to society. In some technical sense this may not be a protest, what- ever that means. The sun does not protest against deeds of darkness, when it happens to throw upon them " intolerable day." It is not a Protest when that which is spoken in the ear is proclaimed from housetops. But that is just what the reply of the British Cabinet does for the Annexation of Savoy. It flashes a brilliant light here and there, and over every part of the subject in turn, bringing out its hidden beauties, just as the torchlight shows off the sculptures in a gallery. Guided by no common hand, the light glances here and there, plays on a feature, or settles on a limb. Here you sce brought out in all its naked charms the loud disinterestedness of the campaign France had entered on for the deliverance of Italy ; then tho sole contingency on which France might be induced to accept Savoy; then the historical fact that, as Venetia remained in Austrian hands, France had given up all thoughts of Savoy; then the reasons for annexation that successively dawned and glowed and melted into one another ;-the na- tural boundary, the identity of language and man- ners, the "-eventidicatiom," and, lastly, the imperious necessity of self-defence against the new kingdom of Northern Italy. The last phase is the one in which PaoTmS submits to be bound. All the other transformations have passed away, unless some freah deception mocks the eye; and it is now int f.mtlpaupperis that NArozoN In. appeals to the sympathies of Europe against the overween- ing ambition and swollen dominions of Sardinia. He must interpose mountains between himself and so dangerons a neighbour. " Well, be it so," the writer of the British despatch seems to say; "then the "world shall do justice to this plea. Let us see "it in all its bearings." So Truth holds her lens, and we soe the plea gloriously magnified. Oat of a world of confusion there stands out the professed alarm of France at the adhesions to Piedmont and the panic-grasp of Savoy. It is the merest trifle in the world, a few mountain slopes; but a drowning man will catch at a straw, and the French Empire, at its last gasp, lays hold of this petty principality. Pressed by numbers, a rifleman will run to any shelter-a shrub or a stone. France crouches behind Mfont Cenis, which it is obliged to hug in its desperation. This is France's last. But it is not so much the last as to supersede all the other accomunts of the transaction. That in- genious nation can wrap one meaning in another, so that tbe new shall not quite efface the old. The " natural frontier," the "identity," the resump- tion, and all the rest remain, though " self- " defence" is just now doing all the work. The King of SAsRDNA ig forced to put up with an earlier phase of the apology. It would hardly become him to inform his newly-assembled people that their imposing phalanx had driven France, in self-defence, to seize his patrimonial Savoy. So he simply acquaints them with the happy " reunion" of Savoy and Nice to an old pos- sessor. The phrase itself is varied. It would not have done to use a term borrowed from the police court;, and implying that Sardinia had filched what France haa reclaimed.
			This lst plea of self-preservation was irre- aistible to the pen that drew up the despatclh in answer to AL Tnouvxiia. It Is shown up in every aspect. When it w5 once conceivable
			that Sardinia might acquire not only Venetia but part of the Tyrol, there was at least more to be said for the strength of her new posi- tion. What has now made Sardinia dangerous tD France is Tuscany, Parma, Modena, and the Romagna. It is this sudden gathering of famous fighting men that frightens France from her pro- priety. Sardinia is now twelve milions, so France must look to herself. She has, it is true, forty millions; but what are these forty millions com- pared with the twelve of Sardinia ? W'hat are a thousand sheep to a single wolf ? Fear is pro- verbially selfish and one-sided. We must therefore set it down to the absorbing influence of the panic, which does not allow of right reason- ing, and actually blinds the judgment, that France has forgotten the converse of her own argu- ment-viz., that if forty millions of men want the possession of Savoy to protect themselves against twelve millions, what must those twelve millions want to protect themselves against forty millions I At this moment it is difficult to imagine a more defenceless population than Vicron Emur-rsa's. Except their own Apennine; where they can be hunted down like rabbits, they have not a stick or a stone to stand behind. As it has been justly said, they are the oyster without its shell. But there is one point of view in which France's estimate of the material means necessary to her safety assumes a colossal importance. What if Venetia should really throw off the yoke that lately became so loose, and, togetherwith the Romans,Neapolitans, andSicilians, flock round the Sardinian standard ? What if there should be a Kingdom of Italy ? France, we must conclude from her own acts and arguments, would give herself up for lost. In mere despair, and as the last chance of holding her own, she would run a muck into Italy, resolved at least to sell her life dear. As any day another COs_An might issue from the Capitol, and flesh his legions upon Frenchmen, thoy would be obliged perforce to repeat the enterprise of Binnnus. But, in fact, they have done so, and, no doubt, it is to prevent Lutetia from being captured by the Romans that France is beforehand with them. But Italy now has fair warning. It sees the securities which France demands for her good behaviour even in the assemblage of twelve million Italians under one banner. They may guess what France would require to reassure herself if the dream of Italian unity should ever be wholly realized.
			Englishmen feel it difficult to treat the appro- priation of Savoy in its naaterial aspects. They look only to its moral significance, and that is the view to which the despatch before us confines itself. When we remember the way in which France has always advanced upon her foes, or her neig,hbours, we feel it cannot much matter to him who occupies the mountain or the lake on her frontier. Vhat we shudder at is the moral portent of France once more advancing, once more tasting blood, and gratifying her insatiable land- hunger. The thing itself is ridiculous. We, who are peopling one continent and ruling over half au- other, smile at the quaint historical appetite for bits of border old in story. It is with us as when a man who has been all his active life in the great world, and has won a fortune, a fame, or a posi- tion out of the broad waste and open sea of life, returns to his native town, and finds the com- panions of his boyhood squabbling for rights of way, 'window lights, fences, and such local trifles; or, perhaps, devoting all their energies to round a corner, or smooth away a projection in their neighbour's tenement. Certainly, if a man has nothing else to think of, his estate is his empire, and his village the world. Let him annex, if he can, by love or money, by force or by fraud, the ten acres that his forefathers never could manage. But the man whose pursuits carry his mind and his interests, if not himself, aU over the world, wil
			smile at the microscopic scale of provincial diplomacy or warfare. The British nation feel that the whole world is their sphere, and that before long their laws, and their language, and their spirit will prevail over many hundred-fold the area of these isles. But France still harps on the old story of her border warfares, and her possessions lost and won and lost again. We are sorry for her, but cannot help her, because she will talke no advice. It is her habit to swell and collapse, to flow and to ebb. She was once a great Empire. The tra- dition haunts her and drives her mad. To protest against her follies -would be to hold a lunatic responsible. We acquit her on the ground of insanity, and are content to see M. THouvvNm rub his hauds, smile, and congratulate himself that we don't Protest. But, if we don't Protest as much as he thinks we ought, at least we tell him what we think of his conduct, aud so wipe our hands of the affair.

			Austia has too great a faith in the principle of legality. She seldom does a wise, or a just, or a generous thing, but she thinks herself faultless if her acts can be defended by the pedants of Inter- national law. Her whole career in recent times has been a series of strictly defensible follies. To the French school of critics who boasted that their tragedies had no faults like those of SH-AspEAaE it was answered justly that a French tragedy was one entire fault. So we may Bay of Austrian policy. The diplomatists of Vienna may be able to run over the incidents of the last 60 years, arid to show that on no occasion has Austria been technically wrong in her international dealings. They may demonstrate that she bhs been throughout a rigidly legal and unaggressive Power, only holding her own, and asking not for that which is another's. They may prove that she has been unjustly provoked by Italy, attacked by France, abandoned by Russia, deceived by England, ill- supported by Prussia and the rest of Germaniy, and made the subject of eternal vituperation by every press in Europe, and yet that none of those countries can lay their hands on a treaty and say " Austria has violated this." The news- papers attached to the interests of the Viennese Court are conitinually reiterating argu- ments of this kind. But how powerles5 they are to comnuand the assent of the world is shown by the fact that the Emperor FsAqems JosEmr, who should be one of the most influential Sovereigns of Europe, is now forced to acquiesce in the triumph of his rivals by the hostile attitude of his own sub- jects. " What judgment shall I fear, doing no " wrong ?" has been the argument of that political Snxyocx, the Austrian Government, for many a year; and the answer conmes in the shape of alien- ated friends, exulting eneaies, and a people on the verge of revolution.
			While their ally and counsellor, the HoLY FATHE, is redauced, after all his threats, to the publication of a merely general excommunication -a thunderbolt with the lightning omitted-and dares not name the Sovereign who has usurped his fairest province, the Austrian statesmen are content to see their vassal sovereignties swept away, with only an impotent appeal to the work of forgotten Plenipotentiaries. No one can read the abstract of the note addressed to the Court of Turin without feeling that Austria has by her own bigotry and folly thrown away a great position in Europe, and destroyed the influence of an Empire which should have been one of the guardians of national safety. Such a docment, invoking the faith of treatLes and protesting against inter- national aggrewsion and aggrandizement, would, if it came from any other quarter, have the highest claims on onr ympathy. The world is not so unconsientious, so slavish, so basely submissive to
			succesful force, so adulatory cf martial- glory,as necessarily to cry down a State vwhicnji has -been worsted in war. If Austria were other than what Bhe is, the Austrian armies might have retroated from Solferino with the respect of mankind, and a province might have been ceded to an enemy without the loss of general respect to the vanquished Government. Europejs too much bound together by common interesss and has too strong a recollection of former suffering3 and danger;, for its principal States to have any- thing but sympathy for the victims of military ambition. It is with no feeling of derision or of contemptnous-pity that we hear an unfortunate State declare that it yields to the fortune of vwar, and that it will not attempt to enforce its rights, because the wrongdoer is more powerful than itself. If Switzerland or Belgium, dis- membered by a hostile attack, had published sullch a remonstrance, it would have had the sympathy, perhaps the active sympathy, of every free people. But what can be said or done for Austria? Who can lament her disasters, or think of aiding her to retrieve them ? Who can stand up for law which has been the shield of injustice, for rights of Sovereigns which have been the wrongs of their unhappy subjects, for treaties which she has taught mankind to consider as bargains of wiclked- ness? Treaties are sacred things when they ara urged by those who have used them to forward the great ends of government-the happiness and pros- perity of nations. They lose their value -when they come before the tribunal of the world tainted with violence and injustice. Europe knows hovw to makle the distinction between what is good and bad, what is corrupt and what is worthy of preservation, in the international arrangements of the past. The aggression on the rights of nations which is contained in the annexation of the neu- tralized territory of Savoy, although technically it may not diurer from the invasion and conquest of Lombardy, is adjudged by the common sense of mankind to be something widely different. France, in the one case, is convicted by general opinion of an outrage on civilization; in the other, even her rivals credit her with a deed of heroism.
			It would be puerile to follow the Austriau Cabinet in its review of the various treaties which from the early days of the last century consecrated the rights of the now dispossessed Princes of Tus- cany, Modena, and Parma. Austria establishes, by historical and legal considerations, her incontestable right to oppose an act which in reality she does not oppose, and she demonstrates her right to a reversion of the Italian thrones on the failuro of dynasties which are now no longer in possession. That the Duchy of Tuscany was guaranteed to the House of LORRAInE by a treaty signed by a pre- decessor of VicToro ErrAauan himself may be true enough; that in 170i3, and again in 1817, similar engagements were entered into; and that as late as 1844 the Court of Sar- dinia confirmed anew the power and ac- knowledged the rights of Austria, are matters which might well have been urged some 15 months ago, but which now have no more importance than the records engraved on the slabs of Nineveh. The whole history of these transac- tions may be summed up in a few words. Austria has had great advantages, great opportunities, im- mense prestige, power, and political influence, and she has thrown them all away. Her former courage and firmness in the midst of misfortunes, her aid to the European cause, and the general conviction that she was a State unaggressive, and powerful only for defence, have induced the Powers to intrust her with extraordinary authority, and to cenfirm it by successive treaties. WVith only common prudence and justice Austria might be now powerful and respected. But the twin demons of military and priestly bigotry have lured her to ruin, and now she is not only no longer able to help Europe should danger menace, but her tottering condition invites the aggressor.
			We have only one counsel to offer this unhappy State, and, as it is nothing more than a repetition of 'what every man of sense in Europe has thought and spoken for years, we can hardly hope that it wiU be received by the Prince whose boyish obsti- nacy has been extolled as firmness by flatterers util it has led to the crash of Solferino. An entire abandonment of the system which has for the last eleven years prevailed in the Empire is, ia the opinion of aU able observers, the only salva- tion of the State. To content the provinces by giving up the hateful principle of German supre- macy, to give civil abilities and commercial enterprise a chauce by a relaxation of military rule, and, finally, to establish that religious freedom which even Spain is beginning to re- cognize, are the first and most necessary duties of the Austrian Sovereign. As for Italy, we would advise the Austrian Government to forget that there is such a land. There ia too much antipathy between the races for one ever to eser- cise peaceful authority over the other. In days to come it may be that a regenerate and re- claimed Government at Vienna may live on terms of saity with the people South of the Alps, but this will only come to pass when tho double-headed eagle has taken its flight for ever from Italian soil. Let Austria be wise 'while there is yet time, and, by separating Veenice from the Empire, carry out the policy which must be the necessary consequenco of her present manifesto. The dominion of the C--esAas will still be extensive enough; the finest countries of Central Europe will still be parts of their heritage. Diminution of territory will be to them increase of strength, and the world may find in them once more able defenders of the peace of E,urope.

			EXPRESS FROM PARIS.
			The following is the letter of our Paris corre- apondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday) :_
			My Spanish letters have aluded lately to a pro- jected movement on the part of the Carlists in Spain. We have to-day the Intelligence that a movement under unusualy serious circumstances bas actually taken place. 'What the telegraph announces is this, that General Ortega, at the head of 3,000 men,- has proclaimed the Pretender, Don Carlos, King of Spain, by the title of Charles VI. and that the movement was at the latest date concentrated at Tortosa, near Valencia.
			From my own private sources I learn that Count Montemolin, now proclaimed as Charles VI., arrived in Paris 10 or 12 days back; that he met here Cabrera (with whom he oecame reconciled after a. long estrangement), General Elio, and some others of less note; that he proceeded to the Balearic Islands, of which Ortega, formerly an ultra- democrat, was Captain-General; that Ortega and the garrison proclaimed Don Carlos; that they Icnded at Valencia, where they were well received, and MIontemolin alho proclaimed, it is said, by the troops. hIontemolin was accompanied by Cabrera and Elio In the expedition; Elio, who is a native of Navarre, no doubt to try to raise the north, and Cabrera Catalonia and part of Valencia. A friend of Cabrera has advanced 24,0001. to Monte- molin.
			M. Louis Venilot, the ex-editor of the Vnirers, left Paris some six weeks or two months since, for Rome. He had, after the suppression of his paper, accepted from a French capit3list the place of in- spector of the Roman railroads. On leaving ParIs he found himself in the same carriage with a re- spectable looking man, of good address and agree- able manners. They soon entered Into conversa- tion; the stranger appeared charmed at finding himEeli with Eo famous a person, and AL Veulilot learned with pleasure that his attractive acquaint- ance was also on his way to Rome on some commer- cial mvatters. They agreed to travel in the same carriage, to put up at the same hotels, and even to descend at the same lodging-house In the Eternal City. Their acquaintance grew closer as they went along, and by the time they reached the end of their journey they were to all appearance the best frienda in the world. A. Venillot an.
			nounced after Eome Weeks that circumstances com- peDed him to return to Paris. His friend expressed deep regret at his speedy departure, and said that he himself wanted only two or three days more to finish his business, when he also intended returning to France, and that It was a pity they could not come jback together ! xL Veuilot observed that, afteF all, a day or two did not much matter, and that he ehould wait for him. He did wait, and both arrived fti Paris last Sunday morning. They pro- ceeded to the same hoteL 1. Veulilot went out for a bath; his friend took another direction. On the former returning to his lodging he was informed, to his astonIshment, that police agents had been to his apartment, and had seized his portmanteau, contain- iDg his papern, &amp;c. He went at once to the E- fecture of Police, and one of the first persons he beheld vwa the amiable companion of hlis journey, who turned out to be nothing more or less than an agent of the secret police. He gave information
			that M. Veuillot had brought important despatches for the Papal Nuncio in Paris. M. Veuillot de- manded his papers; some were restored to him, but the greater part, to the address of the Nuncio, re- tained. He went off instantly to the Nuncio, and informed him of what had happened. His Ex- cellency was greatly excited; he went straight to the Foreign-office, demanded explanations, and declared that if his papers were not given up he should t ^ii1 ^ lcn oaresa ouf all diplomatic re- latlons with the French Government, demand his passports, and quit Paris. It was explained that the seizure of the papers was in consequence of Information being given that M. VeuMilot was made the channel of communication between the clergy and the Court of Rome, with a view to certain manifestations on the part of the clergy in the matter of the bulls of excommunication. The Nhuncio's demand was, however, complied with, and the papers given up.
			The Nuncio was so far weak that M. Veuillot had forgotten 'or neglected to have himself described in his passports as a courier, or as a bearer of de- spatches to the Pope's Ambassador in Paris. There was no seal on the papers, and otherwise nothing official about thenm; and, moreover, it was an infra^- tion of the Post-office regulations to bring letters or despatebes as a private person. The Nunco has got his papers ; M. Veuillot has got those that belonged to him, and will doubtless take care not to be too in- timate with the plausible persons he may happen to meet in a railway carriage when next he goes to Rome. The matter is a good deal talked about here, and, as people laugh at most things, it is a good subject for pleasantry.
			A few days back the Sirfe published in a promi- nent part of its columns the formula of excommu- nication pronounced by the Court of Rome as apropos of the censure issued by the present Pope against the " actors, promoters, advisers," &amp;c., of the annexation of the Romagna. The formula given by the Siecle was copied by the Opinion Nationcale, and subsequently by the other less known Governmental papers. The Sie'e and Opinion ac- companied the formidable document with divers remarks on its enormity, and expended a good deal of learning on excommunications in general. Both those papera pique themselves on their theological learning, and are popularly considered as infallible authoritieson those subjects. MIM. Louis Jourdan and Guerault having formerly been themselves high priests, or something of the sort, in the St. Simo- nian Conventicle founded by Pcre Enfantin, were naturaRly supposed to be strong in theology, canon law,Papal bulls, briefs, rescripts, &amp;c. When the Sidcle and Opinion lationale first gave to the world this ex- communication it struck me that I had seen some- thing like it before, and I suspected that, like the old tin sconce whichMartinus Scriblerius took for an an- cient Roman shield, the Sied's excommunication was of doubtful genuineness. In truth, what it took for Pius IX's excommunication is nothing more or less than the grotesque malediction in Tristraen Shaitdys which Dr. Slop reads while "' my uncle Toby" whistles Lillibullero. I see some one has given a hint to the Monde about the matter, and the Monde very naturally makes the most of it.
			The last number of the Bctvue Conternporai,ie con- tains an article on the social and political character of the English aristocracy, and to which present circumstances give peculiar interest. The Revue Contemporaine, though an avowed supporter of the present form of government in France, differs in some respects from the other defenders of the Im- perial system, and does not refuse to render justice to our institutions, and gives to its readers informa- tion on matters which it would be advantageous for them to know. If French journalists took some pains to ibecome acquainted with a country almost in sight of their shores, they would not fall into the ludicrous blunders they do every day. kL Grand- guillot, in the Constitutionnel of Saturday, informs the world that it is all a mistake to suppose Eng- land is represented by either House of Parliamnent or bv its Dress. He sav:
			" It Is neither Sir Robert Peel, crusbed under the weight of the paternal inheritance; nor Mr. Kinglake, the incompre- hensible poet; nor Mr. E3orsman, whom his constituents have disavowed so publicly ; nor a Whig Minister, who Is apparently ignorant of the duty incumbent on a Liberal Mnistry, of which he Is one of the leading mem- bers,-not one of these Parliamentary Individuals really represents the English people. StiU less is It a journal, whether it be Tle . Times, the Daily News, or the Mforning Herald. No; behind the privileged benches of the Lords, behlnd the noisy seats of the Commnons, there is the mass of the nation," &amp;c.
			Those who were under the impression hitherto that the House of Commons was composed of the representatives of the people, and that a free press was the channel through which public opinion was expressed, vill now find they were in error. A. Grandguillot is apparently hard to be pleased. Seeing that neither the English Parliament nor the English prees kno-w anything of England or English, I have some suspicion that LI. Grandguillot very modestly thinks that he himself and the Cozstits- tiosnel are the only true exponents of English in- terests.
			AT. Louis Jourdan also condescends to lecture u5 in the &amp;&amp;Ie. He highly disapproves the way in wbich the Government, Parliament, the press, and the entire nation think, speak, and act. He kindly advises us to take care of what wo are doing, is of opinion that we deserve his displeasure, and clearly thinks that if we do not take his advice we must " go to the dogs." MM. Jourdan and Grandguillot would do well to read the BReue Contemporai7e.
			AL Beneditti, whose arrival in Paris was prema- turely announced in the French papers, did not re- turn here from Italy until Sunday last. Several Piedmontese officers of superior rank are likewlse expected in Paris. They have been selected by Victor Emmanuel to settle the boundaries of the lately ceded provinces in conjunction with French commissioners appointed by the Emperor. Maps of the provinces have already been prepared under the direction of Marshal Randon, which will serve as a guide to the Commissioners in fixing the boundaries.
			lhe Eunicipal Council of Paris has concluded a contract for the construction of two theatres on the Place da Chatelet-one an Equestrian Circus and tha other a Lyric Theatre. The contractor has bound himself to have the two theatres ready for the reception of their companies within eight months from the day of signing the contract. The MIunicipal Council is occupied not only with beauti- fying Paris, but is likewise taking precautions to protect it against fire. For that purpose it has voted funds for the construction of three barracks for saleurspoTspiers (firemen), In the newly annexed quarters of Paris. One is to be built at Grenelle (15th arrondissement), another at Passy (16th ar- rondsssement), and the third at Belleville (20th ar- rondissement. These three new quarters, at a con- sdderable distance from any post of firemen, siuce their own corps were suppressed at their annexation to Parts, on the 1st of January last, have been greatly exposed to accidents from fire.
			It is expected that the magnificent new street, the Rue du Louvre, will be completed by the end of the present month.
			The establishment of docks and the sale of mer- chandise by warrants, an idea borrowed from Eng- land, appear at length about to be adopted in France. A great prejudice existed against the plan on this side of the Channel, firat because it wan Intro- ducedby the Republicans of 1848; secondly, because In France an advance of money on a warrant for the delivery of merchandise is looked upon as a pawn- broking transaction, and any merchant doing Eo would be considered as labeuring under pecunnary difficulties. A more healthy feeling on the 51i'oject js springing up according an it is better undierstood, thanks to lopr clever wfork-s wbib MP.ve been pub-
			lished on the matter, and among them o0ne by M. Mfaurice Block, which the author read on Satur- day last to the Academy of Mforal and Political Sciences. In this work the advantages to be de- rived from general warehouses (the name by which establishmentsauthorizedto issue warrants are known in France)areexplainedwithgreatforce. AL Maurice Blockl further demonstrates that in a great number of cases credit among French merchants is not fonnded on confidence, but on the certainty of the solvency of th^ d6btor and more frequently on secarities or pledges of which the creditor obtains possession in one ahape or other. There are other ideas suggested in the work of Bf. Maurice Block which appear to be new, and to merit the attention of political eco- nomists. This work iS to be inserted in the minutes of the academy, and will form the introduction to a pamphlet in which AI. Damaschino, a young ad- vocate, explains the French law with respect to gene- ral warehouses and warrants.

			SWITZEBLAND AND SAVOY.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-As the events which occurred in this citS yesta'rday may possibly be 'asrepresented in other quarters, and made to assume a character which, in the present critical state of the relations of Switzer- land with France, could Dot but be highly prejudicial to the intere-ts of the former country, 1 trost you will permit me, as an eye-witness, to give an account of what actually did take place. It would, indeed, be most unjust to the community of Geneva if the im- pression wrere allowed to prevail that the rash and
			nJustifiable act of a few violent and misguided per- sons had been countenanced or encouraged by any section of the population whatever.
			It seems that at 4 o'clock yesterday morning some 50 or 60 persons, about hahl of wvhoin were aNmed, succeeded in evading the vigilance of the police, embarked on board one of the lake steamers, and induced the captain, whose con- plicity in the aliair has yet to be deter- mined, to convey them to Thonon, the chief town of Chablais, -with the avowed intention of exciting the population of that province to a demonstratiou in favour of the Swiss cause. Before midday the news of this escapade had spread all over the town, and the greatest excitement prevailed. The streets were crowded with animated groups, denouncina in the most violent terms an attempt so futile aud, at the same time, so evidently prejudicial to their cause that it was broadly asserted those who had taken part in it were the paid agents of a neighbouring country. Even the authorities found themselves compromised by the negligence of the police, in alowing the steamer to slip away; and the Coencil of State hastened to disavow and coni- demn the proceeding in the following notice, which was posted over the town:-
			" LE CON;SEaIL o'ETAT A SES COXCITOyEXS.
			"Chers Concitoyens,-Le Conseil d'Etat voent d'ap- prendre qu'une cinquantsane d'hommes, porteursde quelques armes, sont partis cotte nuit du Grand Quai pour Is rive Savoislenne.
			" Le Gouvernement de Geneve proteste contra une viola- tion, asDs! imprndente quo coupable, des devoirs quo nous lmnposent a la fois la neutralitd Smisse et nos sympathies blen entendues pour Is cause Savoisimne.
			D6ja tune euquete est conimenoie, at des mesures sont prises pour atteludre les provocateurs de ce moevament et en arreter les f30cbeses cens0eqences.
			'h Sla Conmei d'Etat compte swor sa confiance at lappl de ses coaoltoyeas, at no faillira pas 3t son deor'or, dana Yes air- constances graves oft setrouve la R6publique.
			" Au nom du Censeil drsitat,
			"AI)OLPllE FONTA?EL, Ie Vico-Prisident. "C eneve, le 30 MIars, lSoO."
			The Savoyard Conunittee,wrhosa acts have always hitherto been marked by the greatest good sense and moderation, issued aimultaneously the annexed declaration:-
			" Le bruit so r6pand qu'une bande d'hommes sont partls ce matin de Geneve pour Thonon, sous le pr6texto de soulever la Savoie.
			" Ine tentative semblable risquerait de comprnmettre tout af la fois la Savoie et la Suisse, s'il d6peudailt de qnelque3 hommes 6gar6s de mettre en p6rll la c.wmso sacrce de notre libert6 et do I'ind6pendance Helv6tique.
			" Nous protestons contre la condulte d'un petit nombre d'lndividus dont nous no saurions assez ouvertement r6pu- dier les actes. "L. ARECHAL, Pr6sident.
			" F. BRUEL, Secr6taire. "Gen6ve, le 30 Mars, 1860.I"
			Mleantime, prompt measures were taken for the arrest of the culprits. These were facilitated by the opportune arrival of Colonel Zieg&gt;ler, who has just been appointed by the Federal Government to the command of the Genevese troops. Two. companies of Chasseurs wFere embarked on board a steamer, and proceeded in quest of M. Perrier, the organizer of the expedition, and his comrades. The excite ment had by this time reached so great a pitch that it was deemed advisable to call a public meetmg, and at 5 o'clock in the afternoon about B,000 persons assembled in the Electoral Buildings to hear the explanations of the authorities.
			The following resolution was then rut, and carried unanimously:-
			" Le penple Genevois, r6uni en assemblce populaire le 30 Mars, a 5 heares, au 135timent Electoral,
			"DWclare d6savoner solenneloement touts tentative qSl aurait 6t6 faite contre un nays voisin.
			" La peuple Genevois, fidelo ft P'allanes des Confi6d6r6s, d6clare qu'il se confie entirement aux d6clsions de rAs- sembl6e F6crale.
			" II eat pret A tonts les sacrlfices que Is patrie commune lui demandera, et il so Ylve tout entler, autant pour d6fen- dre les droits que Is Suisse soutient en ce moment, qne poor arreter les hom-mes qui, c6dant Af d'odienses provocatYons, serviraient Is cause de l'tranger en faisant douter deo loyautk Suisse.
			"I n demande au Conseil FWdiral l'envoi imm6diat d'n delegu6 a arist pour dLsavoner, as nom du canton de Gen6ve et de is Conf6d&amp;rstion, toute d6marche qui tendrailt :1 faire sortir la questlon Savoislenne des ni5godaftlons inter- nationales et des voles dignes et energiques qui ont dii entries jusqu'id."
			Throughout the whole of the proceedings the vast assembly seemed animated by the Single desire of manifesting, in the most decided and unequivocal manner, their disapprobation of the act of ML Per- rier and his followers, and they had an opportunity of showing this more forcibly a few moments after the meeting dispersed, when the steamer contain- ing the prisoners who had been caDtured on their return voyage arrived. I saw these mnen as they were marched into the Hlotel do Ville, and with the exception of lI. Perrier him- self, who wore a coat and hat, a more disre- putable collection of gamisis could not be picked out of the streets of Geneva. The greater part of them were lads who looked ex- oessively alarmed at the unexpected turn affairs had taken, while AL Perrier himself, who in his capacity of demagogue appealed to the populace to rescue him, was answered by shouts of " A leaue," and followed by the hootings and jibes of the excited mob. It is said that the peaceable inhabitants of Thonon and Evian, the towns at which the expedi- tion landed, are utterly ignorant up to this moment that the unarmed passengers who visited them yesterday and consumed an unusual quantity of champagne in sundry cafes were swaggering revolu- tionists. It seems that, so far from venturina to rouse the popular feeling by acts of violence against the partisans of France, they actually left the mus- kets with which they had furnished themselves on hoard the steamer, and after a somewhat unsatisfac- torypicnicreturned,-re infectd,to pass the night inpri- son, and undergo a severe penaltyat the hands of the authorities. For it will not be forgotten by their judges that this enterprise, although it has termi- nated in a mnanner bordering on the ludicrous, might, had it been conducted by men of greater courage and determination, have led to consequences most disas- trous to the cause of Switzerland.
			Meantime, it Is not to be regretted that the peo- ple and Government of Geneva should have had this opportunity of proving to the w-orld their respect for international rights which still exist, and their determination to remain steadily faithful to the federal authority, and to those principles of loyalty which have ever characterized the policy of Switzer-

			P.S. The trial of Perrier and his comrades is now taking place, and I am inrormed that Perrier has r.cently returned fromn Paris, wherhe has been resi- dent for some time. It is worlhy of note that the gang wFho accompanied him are men of so low a clas

			THE Rxv. 0. IH. SruxGEox-On Monday even- ing last a meeting of the frlends of Mr. Spurgeon took place at New Park-street Chapel to bear from the secretary (Mr. Cook) his financiaL statement relative to the erectlon of the N'ew Tabernacle, and to testify their Interest in the work by presenting to the building committee an Easter offering. The chair was taken by Mr. Spurgeon, who opened the meeting by a statement of the progress of the building, aR well as a description of its ao- commodation. In contrasting it with the Surrey Music. hall, he said that, although ib would be one-third larger, the provision of mean for the Ingress and egress of the con- gregation was sach that they would be a'ale to quit the ch pel in abouttsi mlnutes, whereas at the former place it took at least 20 minutes for them to disperse. In addition to affording seat-room for 5,000 people, there wousld*be a vestry for olding church meetings,eBc., sufficiently large to enable from 900 to 1,000 to meet. A schoolrocen for the education of 1,500 chUdren, as well as rooms for the other institutions helonginz to the cause, would be built on the basement floor. Ar. Spurgeon has already some 10 or 12 young men whom he is training for the ministry. he intends to inmrese their number to about 50. An extensive library will be provided for his studentsa,'eso will be enabled to pursue their studles at the chapel. The bullding is exr pected to be cufficlently finished to enable the congregation to meet for worship by the end of the ramme)r. Several ministers addressed the meeting, congratulating both pastor and people on the succesi which had hitherto attended them. Among the many liberal supporters whose contribations were gratefully acknowledged, one was deserving of particular notice. A. lady, some short time slncg1 vwls seen by the clerk ef the works curiously endeavouring to look at their pro- gress, when be 'invited her inside. After viewing the whole of lIit rooms, ho., she retilred, begging that she might be alluwe*' to leave 1001. as a token of her admiration of the prVt0r who wrould fill the plpit, but a;t the same time re- IiUga to leave her name. Nearly 21,000!has been already coDlected. The entire cost of the Tabernclewillbenn wards of 30,0001. Towards obtaining the amount sl needed an appeal was made to the meetine, when 610! was contributed in a most hearty m er. The meeting sepA. rated at about 10 o'clock.

			2HB FBAUDS In THE AUSTrIAJN C063r-
			MISSARPJAT.
			(mo3M A CORRSPOD--%T.)
			TRIESTE, MlARCH 29.
			The engroissig toplo. f the day ig tho gigantic frauds dis- covered in the Commissarlat Department, which, no doubt, were in no small degree influential in bringing to SD sudden a termination "he recent hostilities between the Anstrian and Franco-Italian armies, and which drag to light, despite most powerful infiuence, a series of disgraceful facig, in- volving 3 multitude of names, come of them holding positions so high as to render even allusions hazardous, in charges of the most flagrant political and moral turpitude. The ac- counts in the Vienna ana other Austriau newspapers are meagre in the extreme; and, but for the suiclde of General :1natten on the 7th-Sth inst., which admitted ofno conceal- ment,thesefrauds would probablyhaveneverbeenaUlldedto. The deficit amounts to the astounding sum of no less than 1,000,000 dorius, or 1,700,0001. sterling, of vwhich 3,000,000 flrlns, or 300,000?., is laid to the charge of some of the leading capitalists of this city. One was imprisoned, two have fled, and others are undergoing forced examinstlous of books, papers, documents, &amp;-c. The strangest pat of tho talo is, however, that which is certainly the least kmoorn. It is said, andfrosn thesources from whence Ihearit I beReve itistrue, thatat the celebrated meeting of the rlval Emrerors which led to the armistice, and subsequently to the preliminaries of the treaty of peace at Villafranca, when Napoleon and Francis Joseph were left quasi alone for nearly three quarters of an hour, the former, addressing the latter. said, " Your Majesty would do wvel to listen to friendly and well-meant counsels. You are surrounded by traitors. Your Majesty believes that your fortress of Mantua is provisioned for six months; I tell y.nu," emphati- caly risinig his finger, " it has not food for as many days. Test my information, and act accordingly." And so it proved, and afforded another lesson also of the infinite superiority of the French over the Austrian system of csplonnagc.
			To give some Idea of the bare-faced effrontery of tho fraud, and the number of accomplices necessary, one in- s.ance 'will suffice, though, if needful, I could adduce many others. Mantus is a walled city, nnd tho bullodks whiah were driven in at one gate passed through the town out at the opposite, and then, making the.hbaf circuit of the wails, re-entered at the first gate, and every bullock made this parade five times! Tho richestpartof thetalein connexion with Mantuna is yet to come. A firm in Trieste made a con- tract -with the Austrian Government for the hides of the bullocks supplied for tho -use of the troops. Now, although eachhbulock did duty living for five, stil he could only be kdlled once, and supply one hide. The contractors, there- fore, called upon and actually received from the Govern- ment the forfeit, as stipulated by contract, of one florin upon every hide short deivered; thus profiting to the ex- tent of 30,000 florins for the non-delivery of the sklis of animals which had never been kiDed ! Solfcrlno and Magenta might each have told another tale had not the hunger caused byAustrian fraud weakened,if not paralyzed, Austrian valour. Fnough of this for the present.
			A good on dit is getting en extensive under-currency, and Is believed by some; I do not aver that I am of the number, nevertheless the tale tells well, and it may, therefore, be prudent not too closely to test its accuracy. It is said that the Emperor Francis Joseph, being disquieted by the triple recurrence of a dream, had recourse to the coun- sels of his mother, the Archduchess Sofia, who at once sum- moned to her aid a " weird sister" in whose mystic talent sbe had herself confidence. Introduced to the august pre- sence, the crone demanded what visons of the night had startled the Imperial slumbers. The Emperor informed her ho had dreamed of thzeo mice; the first perfectly blind, the second so immensely bloated and fat it could scarcely wall-, and the third weak, poor, and almost dying from star- vation. The beldame appeared alarmed,and at first professed her inabilityto affordanycolution ;but,on beingreaasuredand informed that under any circumstances she might rely not only on protection but reward, she took heart, and, much to the astonishment of her Imperial interrogators, replied, "The blind mouse is your Lajesty ; the fat mouse, your Ministers; andtheworn-out,starving, andexhausted mouse, your people." Be the tale weU or il founded, it is suill- ciently analogous to the preeent state of the empire; but the worst part of it Is that the blind mouse does not at present appear to have opened his eyes, and, if he con- tinues to persevere in his present course, bids fair to realise the warning prophecy of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, when nine months ago he gave deep umbrage to his Imperial brother by saying, " If your Majesty goes on thus, you will not stop till you have lost yourself and your empire." Apropos of the Archdake Ferdinand Maxi- ,nmian.-a young man of education, genius, and talent far beyond the common order, and universally esteemed and beloved, except by one or two exalted personages-there is no doubt that his voyage to Madeira and the Brazils, from whenco he is now on his return, 'was in reality an honorary exile. The advice which was once rejected is now sought, and his return is anxiously ex- pected, as ho possesses more brain than aU the rest of the Hapsburga concentrated. He is generaUy expected bere abont the middle of AprIl, but I believe the commence- ment os .he month is more probable. Ilis steam yacht, the Fantasia, left at midnight very recently to meet him, on the expected arrival of the Elisabetta frigate at an island which he bought a few montbs ago on the Dalmatlan coast for the purpose of erecting another marine residence; and I know positively that on the same day a telegram arrived from Vienna for the purpose of hastening his departure for the capital to attend a Council.

			FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
			THE PAPAL STATES.
			(FROM OUB OWN COBR PONDENT.)
			eA porslon of the following appearod in ou second
			eon of yeser?da:-1
			ROME, ?dAnc 27.
			New arrests and domiciliary visits! I have hardly any news of a more cheering nature to communl- cate. The few foreigners who had come to Rome for the ceremonies of Holy Week have been struck. with horror, or seized with disgust, at the msasacres of the 19tb, and are leaving us precipltately. To- console the Romans, the Government has lalda new tax on cattle, from which they antlcipate an ln&gt;- crease to the revenue of 35,000 scd. You hear the people savagely curs9tg in the streets, and saying, "URnless we eat each other, what are we to live upon b"
			There are not mnany here who entertain any doubt am, to the real causes which led to the bloody scenes of the 19th. The Papal Government had been led fo believe that there might be eomething, after a1l, In the reiterated threats of the -ithdrawal of the French troops. They thought they could avail themselves of the last days of their prerence so to terrorize the population that it might afterwards be eassy to keep their seat in Rome either by theilr owns unaided forces or by Neapolitan help. If the French Emnperor's consent to a Neapolitan occupation of the MIarches and lJmbrla could be obtained, it] might be worth while to try to concentrate upon the capital all that Papal rabble which Is now keeping the distant provinces in check, and use them in support of the Holy See at head-quarters; for that purpose it will be just as well if the Gendarmes at present in Rome have an opportunity t o flesh their swords - among the multitude, and if any outbreak, or mere pretence of an outbreak, affords an opportunity, for thin- ning the patriot ranks by summary proceedings and wholesale proscriptions so much the better. The echeme has succeeded tolerably well hitherto, but I think the Government will find themselves sadly out in their reckoning. The Romans, whatever people may say who do not know them, are a brave, enduring, and highly vindictive race. Only let it be clearly understood that the French are iione never to return, and they will number these few
			wiss or Bavarian cnt.hroats, and put themselves in a position to give a good account of them. As tlo t^he Neapolitans, I am sorry to have to say it of such sister races, but a Roman's blood boils in his veins at the mere mention of his souther neigh- bour. Even greater than this rancorous hatred is the supreme contempt in which, whether justly or otherwise, the Bourbon's troops are held. If the Pope is wiling to see the " dance" begin in earnest, just let him bring in Neapolitans to do garrison duty in the Traseevere.
			There is every reason to believe that the Papal Go- vernment, not sated with the blood that was spUlt in the Corso on Monday, the 19tb, has been trying to excite the people to new disturbances towards the end of last week, and especially on Sunday last, when it was expected that the Corso would be as usual, swarming with promenaders. On Saturday, the 24th, printed bills were seen stuck up at the street corners, which said, " Romans, do not to- morrow bring the women with you, nor yet the children, for we must have our revenge." Else- where I read, "Gendarmes! to-morrow we await you at the Corso r" Up to a late hour in the morn- ngof SundayI saw these bills with my own eyes in t,he Corso, andyet, mark well ! the Corso had been all the foregoing night like an encampment,thronged with troops of every descrption. Towvards 6 on Sun- day morning two guns went out of Porta Angseca, and were taken round to the barracks of the Piazza del Popolo,-a clear hint of the precautions taken by Government, which harboured designs evidently In the style of King Bomba. In the morning, how- ever, nothing happened. The tanners, who really thought those bills had been stucl up by the Liberal Committee, were preparing for vengeance. The sane did the Transteverini, the Montigiani, the popolani of every description. These same bills had been spread in the adjoining country, so that from several villages men in arms came to town to have their reranche. Th., Liberal Committee, aware of the danger, and knowing the instigators of the im- pending strife, as quick as lightning printed and
			. tributed the proclamation which I here translate and enclose -
			'Romans !-An atrocious and bloody outrage has been perpetrated. You wiah for vengeance, and it is due to you. It goes hard against our own hearts to have to moderate the past ions of a people provoked to the greatest excesses by the mo: t abject of Governments. but In public no less than in pri ate life we mrust learn to endure and wait, to conquer ou feelings, and give them vent only when we have at least a clance of Euccess. Certainly, If our only object were to shoe. the priests that you do not dread their cut-throats -tiose sbin-i whom, with a cruelty unknown to the Boun bon, or even to Austria, they, the 51inisters of Christ, have armed with daggers-you wevl know the trial would be neither long nor arduous. Bet our purpose is to free Rome froni their yoke. The time for it is not far off, but it has not come yet. Any movement at this moment would be niot only unseasonable, but we might increase the difliculties the noble defenders of the national cause have to contend with, and might come into collision with the Frencb, to whom you, asltalians,owea debt of gratitude. For the present, then, give proofs of discretion. Thoso who are provoking you will see at a proper moment whether yon lack courage. Those who are now prompting you to violent re- venge act In the interest of the Government . they would wish to shed fresh generous Roman blood-a blood which would do harm, not good to the country. These suggestions come from the priestly and Austrian party, the foes to our regfneration. Beware of them !"
			These few lines had a wonderful effect. The Pope went to the Mlinerva. Some of his friends cheered hin, but the town was mute. In the afternoon the Corso was almost entirely empty. Thus did the scheme miscarry.
			MIeanwhile of a Government shrinking from no exhemes of this nature, and of a people so obedient to every hint of their leaders, what are we to ex- pect-especially if both are left without the inter- venig barrier of the French garrison? Are the French reaUy going ? al going? going for good? Are we to have nothing but Papal troops-native or foreign ? Are we to have the Neapolitans ?
			All I can say is that the talk abous it is so general that even my strong conviction to the contrary Is well-nigh shaken. Remember, however, I told you the Pope would depart before his French pro- tectors and the Pope's fliaht is stiU an almost un- avoidable consummnation. EHe will first accomplish his visit to Benevento; then, if storms arise, as arise they must, he will fly to Gaeta, and, finally, em- bark for Spain. Then will be the time for Sardinia and Naples either to share the Roman spoils be- tween them, or to wrench them from each other's clutches. Should Francis of Naples relent, offer to come to terms with his people, to follow a liberal, national policy, and should he still find men wiing to believe him, then we might have the Itallan Dualism and the Pope would either never come hack to kome, or only come back on his people's own terms-to be a priest, a bishop of Rome, a primate of Italy, and nothing but a spiritual lordL The two kingdoms of Northern and Southern Italy would join hands at Rome, as in a neutral city, the connecting link of the national league.
			But, were the King of Naples, as is far more likely, to persist iu his obduracy, or were he too far gone to find people willing to come to terms with biTn, then, no doubt, he and the Pope, if abandoned to themselves, would surely fall, and then either would Piedmont have the whole of Italy or the southern half would fal into the hands of him who has just been baffled In his crooked designs upon Central Italy, and who is now digesting, with such relish as he can, those meagre bones of Savoy and Nice with which Sardinia was, ln an evil moment, compelled to glut his appetite. Let Europe be on the look out, or we shall have a Bonaparte on the throne of Naples ere we are three months older I

			AUSTRIA.
			(FRO:M OIVR OWN COPMEMSPOhiD}T.)
			Y15i A-, 51 A CH Si.
			The day before yesterday this Governmeut for- warded to Paris a note, in wnich It formally pro- testa agaist the annexation of the Italian Dachies by Sardinia, and announces its resolve not; to resign ita reversionary claims to Tuscany and Modena. In the Ausrian note mention is also made of the vie- lation of the treaties of Villafranca and Zurich, and of the annexation of Savoy, but in such guarded language that neither the Emperor Napoleon,nor Ml. Thouvenel can possibly take offence at it. A protest against the incorporation of Tuscany and Modenz, which was forwarded to the Sardinien Government, through the Prussian
			"egat'On, on Thursday last, is said to be much more energetic than the one that was sent to Paris on the same day. Several attempts have recently been made by England and PruEsia to Induce Austria to give her support to
			Switzerland in the matter of the neutralized dis- tricts of Savoy, but they have proved fruitless, this Government being resolved " not to meddle In or vith the businesa of other people." In- poRtical
			circles it Is stated that Autria will remain in-; active, " even though the French should invade the German provinces on the left bank of the Rhine," but a military man of the highest rank yesterday declared this to be " dummes geschw&amp;&amp;' (mere stuff and nonsense). It is very generally believed that the so-called "rectification" of the Fzench fron- tier towards Germany will begin on the Upper Rhine, and great preparations for the defence of the Palatinate (Rhenish Bavaria) are now being made in Bavaria Proper. Should Franca muake an attack on the Ehenish provinces of Prussia, this Government would doubtless be very slow in its movements, but it would not re- fuse to give asistance to its Federal ally. Austria entertains no kindly feeling towards Prussia but she cannot break with her, as the Germanic Confede- ration would be entirely dissolved If she did so. Even nowr there is a great schism in the Bund, and the French Government wil hardly fail to take advantage of it. A dementi has to-day been given to the report that an intrenched camp is to be formed in Prusaia, but tho semi-official statement has failed to convince the public that it is an error. The information which has reached this city on the subject is, that the outline of an in- trenched camp wiU be drawn in the neighbourhood of Dinalaken (in the government of Dusseldorf) on Mlonday next. On the northern side of the town is the so-called Drasens Tower, and it will probably be taken within the wall or fence of circumvallation. 120,000 pali- sades have already been contracted for, ana it is oxpected that others will soon be purchased. It Is evident that the Emperor of the French has begun to study the German question, for several German publicists have recently received information that the French Government, in order to strengthen the �friendly relations between France and Germany, wishes to establish some German papers, " which; will receive the necessary instructions from Paris." In the letters addremed to the German writers it is particularly mentioned that they will be generously rewarded for their services. A few days aao Prince Luitpold, who is Commander of the First Divi- sion of the Bavarian army, observed to some of his subordinates that the Bavarian army would probably soon have an opportunity of displaying its courage and discipline. In Austria the Bavarian troops have a high reputation for courage, but they are accused of being over-much given to marauding when in foreign countries.
			The so-called xrelsbehirden (the authorities of the circles) have been abolished in Upper and Lower Austria and Styria. As long as the manor, or "patrimonial" courts, were in being the Kreisbe- h6rden were necessary for the protection of the pea- sants against the arbitrary will of their masters'- but when viUenage and soccage were abolished in Austria the principal and more important part of their occupation was Pgone. Ft i3s stated that the provincial constitutions have been laid before the Emperor for his sanction but the report can hardly be correct, as the enlarged " Reicharath" is to meet in the month of May. As the provinces have waited nine years for the realiza- tion ofthefImperial promise it will be nogreat m3sfor- tune to be obliged to wait a couple of months longer.
			In the Wiener Zeitung we read that . von Plor- bazzi, who is perhaps the most unpopular man in Venetia, has been made delegate of the district of Venice. The Austrian Government has such a wonderful talent for putting the wrong men into the wrong places, that M. von Piombazzi may perhaps be one of the two representatives of Venetia in the Council of the Empire.
			Yesterday various sorts of Government Bonds, of the nominal value of 140,025,992fl., which were found by the Commission in the Sinking Fund Department, were publicly burnt. The Vienna papers continue to write up the loan, but
			the public displays great reserve, althougyh the bait- offered in exLtremely tempting. The Stadtholders in the different provices send to the landed proprie- tors to ask them to subscribe to the loan, and here a dead Eet is made at the bankers, proprietors of houses, shopkeepers, &amp;c
			The Duke of Brabaut will leave for Constan- tinople this evening. His Royal Highness has had a Danubian steamer placed at his disposal by the Emperor.

			SPAIN.
			The Madrid Gazete of the 29th ult. publishes a despatch from Marshal O'Donnell to the Mnister of State (Foreign Affairs),encloing the text of the pre- liminaries of peace with Morocco. The despatch gives a brief account of the conference with Muley Abbas, and Eays that the latter accepted all the points proposed except that which regarded t4e indemnity. On that point he begged, i- stend of the 500,000,000 reals claimed, that only 400,000,000 reals should be ixed; "and," says the Marshal, "the strong desire he mani fested for peace, his elevated position as Caliph, and the dignity with which he suppored his un- fortunate fate, caused me to reduce my demanki. to 400,000,000 reals. It appeared to me that it would not have been generous in my country tb humiliate still further an enemy who, though ad-. beg himself to be defeated, cannot in any way
			edespised." The prelimiaries of peace are in nine articles, and are to the effect already stated bytele- graph. In the preamble Lo them Marshal O'Don- nell iB described as Duke de Tetuan and Count de Lucena, and Muley Abbas as CaUph of the Empire of Morocco and Prince of Algarve. The Gazette announces that the Queen, by the advice of the Council of Mfinisters, approved the prellmi- naries.

			STAMPED NBWSPAPBRS.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-After reading your article upon, and the description given in your paper of the General Post-office, I may hone that you will speak a word against the proposed withdrawal of the 14 days' free currency now granted to " stamped newspapers." The effect of such withdrawal will be to de- prive all those, who, like myself, live in the country remote from towns and railways, and whose income Is too small to allow of their taklng in a London paper on their " own acconnt," of seeing a newspaper at alL Since the abolition of the "penny tax on knowledge," country-town frlenas have ceased to send us their papers, not caring to be at the troul?le or expense of fixing a postage stamp upon thenm; and Low country nelghbours who, by means of the local post, are enabled to join in a London Daper must dissolve partcership.
			The remission of the " penny tax" was no boon to us; hut, as above, a positive loss. It was, however, no injus- tice, and, therefore, we had no reason to complain.
			The reposting of stamped newspapers can very little affect the General Post-office, the great bulk of such retransmis- sions passing through country post-ofces. The wlthdraws.l of the present privilege is but a very shabby piece of eco-. nomy in itself and cruelly oppressive to thosowho are already overbuxdened.
			Very likely-like " rags" in the treaty-Mr. Gladstous may have overlooked this view of the case.
			I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
			A POOR COUNTY REOTOR.

			POST-OFFICE WISMAfBfMEyT.
			TO THE :EDITOR OF THE TIMS.
			Sir,-The foRlowing facts will servo as a comment on your recent artiles on the bad management of the Post-office.
			I was staying during the last month ia the Sardtulan States, and deslied thbt my newspapers should be sent to me. My friend, on inquiy at the Pos-office, was informed that a penny stamp would Insur their arrival. Oat of 16 papers sent so stamped to Nleice, only one reached me., On, mentioning this, I found many other persons had suffered: the same annoyance, but was informed that if tro samps were put on I should probably be more successful. I gave orders to that effect, and the newspapers arrived safely.
			Surely the Poet-office authorities might know thder own minds a Uttle better than this, and spr travellers such unn n-ee-sary inconvenience; or, if they eqmire aouono mono beside tne regular tariff they should make it more gonerally known.
			I am,. Sir, your obedient servant.

			A derelict sloop had been picked up in the Lower Bay of New York. Upon examination it was dis- covered to have been the theatre of a crael and bloody contest, ending probably in the destruction of every member of the crew.
			The ship Uriel, of Boston, Is reported to have fallen in, on the 22d of January, in lat. 23 39, long. 68 60, wvith the Portaguese brig of war MIondigo, bound from China for iSsbon, in distresr, and to have taken off 9 officers, 55 of the crewv, and 2 women. The remainder of those on board, number unknown, went down with the brig. The Uriel los three of her j&amp;en by the staving of her boats.
			The following further details relative to the bon- bardment of Vera Cruz by Miramon, and the cap- ture of the two steamers by the American sloop of war Saratoga, had been received -
			NEW OILuSs, March 2L "iiramon notified the foreign vessels that he would com mence the bombardment of Vera Croz on the night of the 13th, and he would not be responsible for the shipping an- chored under the castle. On the night of the 13th the officers on the deck of the General Miramon heard heavy cannonading in the direction of Vera Cruz. There were captured with the two steamers si mortars, six 24-pounders, and 2,000 stand of small arms. The steamers are worth $60,000. They broke down on the third day out, a.nd put into Sial. The materials of war were stored away below, out of sight of the men, who were Ignorant of the destination of the expedition, and who were forced Into the zervice. Manln's steamers returned the Sarato"a's fire and then tried to escape. The Indianoli 'pursued the Miramon, whereupon the latter fired on her. The Indianola returned the fire, and her crew boarded the Miramon at the point of the bayonet. A portion of the Indlanola's deck was carried away by the shot. The Miramon was then run aground, and the Saratoga brought the Marquis to. The Picayune is informed, b3y French prisoners on board the prizes, that the fihting was done qrincipaliylbyte offlicers, who were obliged to chargt and
			hetne guns, assisted only by Mexican officers from the shore. The two steamers had 250 'on board and their killed and wounded amounited to 40. The indlanola and Wave had 80 men each. The first esgineer of the Marquis, ani American, was killed. Captain Turner asked MIaria why he fired on ',he Acuneriean vessels without provocation. Main replied that his men could not be controDled. He knew the nationality of the Saratopa and understood her signals. -Thle men ired contrary to h
			orders. Captain Turser replied "You are entirely respon- sible for the outrage." It is stated that the expedition cost $300,000, mostly furnished in Havamnahby the (overnment, in accordance with a secret article of the Almonte Treaty. The prize steamer Marquis is anchored offthis city. Lieu- tenant Chapman has received orders from.Washington to remain here and forward his despatches. He has de- epatches also for the British Minister. Juarez's pro- clamation, declaring Marin's expedition piracy, authorized any one to capture It. The DeZia publishes the detatis of the negotiations between the British and Mexican Governments. Lord John Russell proposes an armistice, a general amnesty, and religious toleratlen. If the proposition is declined, E.ngland must demand from both parties in Mexico the foil indemnity due to English subjects. M�iram on has preposed the terms of the armistice, and stipulates that England FPrance, Spain, I3russia, and the United States shall be mediatorsfor the establishment of peace. Mleantime the C3ustom-house duties are to be divided between the two p arMes. Juarez returned liramon's communication on the
			inst., with the declaration that the propositions were ab- surd and Inadmissible."
			The transactlons in the commercial markets were without any materils change. Freights to Lon- don :-Lsrd and tallow, 30s.
			The Australassian, which has brought the above advices, has bean chartered by the OCanadlanlRoyal Mlail Company, and will take her departure for Portland on the 11th inst., with the usual mails for Nortsh Amnerica.

			FATAT. BoTrnx E-x-nLo-s-soP.-The Newcastle-on- T'yne coUllery district appears destined to a fearf ul notoriety this spring through- exposlomsin maines and explosions of steam. boi)%ers. Folloiong theo awful Burradon explosion we recorded a destructive colliery boiler explosion last week, and we' have this mnorning to report another colliery boiler explosion, which has been extremely destructive. The underviewer at Blaydon Mai-n, 'where the boiler ex- plodedlasi week, bappened to be a brother of Mr. Johnson, the underviewer of Bur-radon; and, by another singnlar coin- cidence, the collery -where the explosion we are abouLt to record has happenedL Is closely adjacent to Barradon, and formerly belonged to the same owners, we believe, the " Grand Allies," both colltieies using the same waggon way for conveyance of their coals to. the places of shipment. Se-aton'Burn Colliery belongs to Messr. John Wewes and Co., the owners of a large amount of col. liery property In the north, and the smine is undeor the charge of Mlr. S. C. Crone, viewer. In carrylng on the workings of the colliery two engines were generaliy em- ployed, one for pumping and another for winding, a third, which has bieen superseded by one of these, being kept in reserve, and occasionally used In feeding the boilers when the puraping engine was off work. The steam required for this machinery was supplied by six hollers, each measuring 32 ft. by 6) ft. 10 in., which were arraged on one bed to the north of the engine-house with thei-r ends pointing east and west. The outside hollr at the north end of the row, was a new one, and, besides other appianes,wasfited asan xpeimet,with Mr. Archer's safey-vlve Toeac oftheothrs ereattached two escpevalesandtw foat, ne f hecommon descrip- tio, ad te oheran lar whstlngfloat.

			THE BRAZILIAN ANTD RfrB PLATE
			MAILS.
			------ S bb-
			fA teleg-pho smmary of the following appeared in our eecond edition of yesterday:-]
			The Royal Mail Company's steamship Tyne, Cap- tain J. H. Jellicee, with mails iu charge of Lieute- nant W. J. R. Card,. IRN., Admiralty agent, arrived at Southampton yesterday at 4 am. Her
			AA+toq -wprA
			As far ss St. Vincent the Tyne experienced fine weather, thence to Lisbon strong head winds and heavy swell, and between Lisbon and Southampton strong north-westerlv gales and a very heavy sea.
			This packet brought l3passengers, among whom were the following from Buenos Ayres :-Senor Don Carlos Calvo, Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Paraguay to the Governments of France and England; Signor Marcelo Cerrutl, Sardiniian Mlnister in the River Plate to the Governments of the Oriental and Argentine Republics; MIarshal SantaCruz,formerlyPresidentof Bolivia andalso Minister in France of the said country.
			Her Majesty's ship Oberon was at Buenos Ayres, the Leopard and Spy at Montevideo, and the Buz- zard and storeship Mfadagascar at Rio de Janeiro.
			By a supplementary mail, which caught the packet at Montevideo, we have dates from Buenos Ayres up to the let of March, from Rosario to the 26th of February, and from Paraguay to the 20th.
			In Buenos Ayres the question of its incorporation with the Confederation continued to be discussed by the press -with much ardour. The Liberal party in the Conventlonhad obtained some advantages, first, in electing a special committee to examine the con- stitution of the Confederation; and, secondly, in the report of this committee recommending many reforins in the Constitution before its acceptance by Buenos Ayres. As it is not probable that the Con- federation will admit these reforms, fears are enter- tained that the.union may be postponed sine die.
			Four of the steamers forming the Buenos Ayrean fleet had been chartered by private companies, to be worked as packets.
			The Government had conceded to a M. Lelievre the privilege of making a railway to connect the city with the southern districts of the State, con- ditionally on its being commenced within ayear from the date of concession. Application had also been made for permission to lay down the electric tele- graph between Buenos Ayres and Rosaxlo.
			F rom the Confederation we hear that the election for the second presidential period resuilted, as anti- cipated, in favour of Don Santiago Derqui, cidevant Minister of the Interior to IJrquiza. This election was considered as unfavourable to the interests of Buenos Ayres, owing to the notorious enmity of Dlerqui to the predominant Liberal party in that
			,tate. Already it was confidently reported that he contemplated the re-establishment of the differential duties against Buenos Ayres, nnless she joined the Confederation without further delay. Should this impolitic step be taken, English commerce, now so active, would at once be depressed, and it was feared that BuenosAyres would be driven to the necessity of declaring herself independent. No fears were en- tertained of war again breaking out, owing to the depressed state of the finances of the Confederation , and&amp;to the impossibility of raising men without the helpof General IJrquiza. To remedy the state of the finances, lt was proposed to obtain a loan in E"ngland, to enable thiem to pay off the floating debt of some 3,000,000 silver dollars, giving as secu- rity a portion of the rental of all the Custom-houses of the Confederation.
			General Juan Estevan Pedernera was elected Vice- President. No Ministry had been formed when the mail left.
			General Urquiza, having ceased to be Presldont, stll retained the post of Commander-in-Chief of all the forces and the Governorship of his province of Entre Rios, which he has now held for 15 years, where it was his ffied determination to remain in peace, giving up politics entirely, and devoting him- self to the management of his enormous private paroperty.
			From Paraguay we hear that the war steamer Tacuari, so long detained in Baenos Ayres by the English cruisers, had arrived at Ascension amid great rejoicings. General Lopez was anxious to re- establish the amicable relations hitherto existing with England, and had accredited Senor Don Carlos Calvo as resident Minister in London, with the obiect of arranging the questions in disputse, and of preventing any future misunderstandings.
			The railway from the capital to the y,erba and tsobacco districts wvas progressing rapidly, uder the direction and management of resident English engineers.
			Dates from Montevideo are to the 2d of March, the packet having been detained a day to bring the result of the election for President, which took place on the 1st. The election was in favour of Don Bernardo P. Berro by a large majority, every- thing being conducted in the most orderly manner, without any attempt to disturb the peace. This result bad given general satisfaction to the majority of inhabitants, both foreign and native. It was ex- pected that he would carry out an equally firm though more liberal policy than his predecessor, and that a general amnesty for all political offences would at once be promulgated, to enable many exiles to return to the country.
			The port of Paysandu, on the Uruguay, had been opened to foreign trade.
			A new lighthouse had been established at Punta del Eate, near tbe Poct of Maldonado, visible in good weather 12 miles. The light on Lobos Island had, inceonsequence,v been extinguished.

			COMMERCIAL LLLIGENCE.
			Bnusness in Imnorts In the River Plate generally con- tinued very actiie. The stockfs of most classes of sultable goods bavlng become much reduced, some advance had been established m prices, particularly in ahirtings and prints of suitable styles.
			In produce little had been done durlng the month, the great drought of the previous three months having prevented its transport to town, and also the bringing of cattle to the saladeros. Rain had, however, faUen, and the salad6ros were expected to resume work in the following month. Prices had in the meantime improved to 61 reals for salted ox and cow hides, at which rate several parcels already on board at lower rates had changed hands. A contract for all the produce of cattle to be slaughtered in General Urquiza's salad6ros in Entre Rios, estimated at 30,000 head, during the rest of the season had been taken by a Buenos Ayrean
			Exchange on Bnenos Ayres, after receding to 66s. Gd. per doubloon, closed at 67s. D)?oubloons had risen to 353 per oy., owing to the anticipated commercial hostility to Buenos Ayres on the part of the new President of the

			TUB ANGLO-FRENCH TREATY.
			The foUowing communication from Her :Majestys Government has been forwarded to the different Chambers of Commerce relative to the working of the Commercial Treaty with France, in order. that they may be put in pos- session of any facts that may make the measure more per- fect, and at the same time be in accordance with the prac- tical views of the manufacturing interests of*this country:-
			"Offire of Committee of Privy Council for Trade,
			' March 24, 1860.
			"Sir,-I am directed by the Lords of the Committee of Privy CouncO for Trade to request that yoa will inform the Chamber of Commerce of that, with a view to, negotiations which are in progress for the purpose of asr ranging the detals of the now French tariff of Imporb daties upon the articles of the prodnce and manufactures of the United Kigdom enumerated in article farst of the treaty of the 23d of January 1860, they are desirons of obtaiuing any information wh'ch the Chamber may be able to supply. in cornexion with the branches of the British exportation trade in which that body is more especially interested. These are the three questions In regard to which my Lords miore especially desire accurate and detailed statements at the earliest convenience of the Chamber:-
			" 1. As to the classification which, in its opinion, it would be desirable to adopt in respect of such manufactures with a view to the arrangement of specific duties by weight in the French tariff.
			" 2. As to the average prices of each class of such mnamufactures with reference to such classification.
			" 3. Upon what description of each class of goods it is more especiaUy important that the duties should be reduce .
			below the maxirnusm of 30 per cent. ad valorcma, whether such duties should be charged 3iz valorcem or the ad valore7n rate be taken as a basis on which to assess specific duties, and upon wbat special grounds such reductions are im- portant.
			"In reference to the second head I am to observe that the 13th article of the treaty with France, of the 23d of January, 1860, provides that the average price of the arti- cles of British produce and manufactures enumerated in the treaty during the six months last preceding Its signature shall he taken as a basis in fixing the amount of the import duty upon them; my Lords would therefore desire to be furnished with a state- ment of such average prices during the period therein men- tioned, but they would be glad at the same time to obtain a similar statement of such average prices- during each of the three years Immediately precedi, the date of the treaty I am to add that my Lords wiU be happy to receive any. statement or Euggestion with regard to the branches of trade represented by your Chamber which that body may think. hkely to be of use to Her MajestyE Government in the pre sent negotiation. I -am, in conclusion, to state, with reference to- a desite which has been expressed in certain quarters, that deputations should be sent to Paris on the subject of the treaty, that my Lords would suggest for the .*corisideration . of the Chamber of Commerce of - whether it. may not be possible and desirable that a delegate .might be selected from each branch of. the industties with which the Chamber is connected to represent the common interest of such parti- cular branch, and7to proceed, if it he necessary, to Paris, to supply sany information on 'the st7ot 'which may be re- quired in the nlegotiations of' the French taif

On going alongside the captail of the bark reported her to be in a smiking condi- tion, and the steamer kept company with her till wlthin a few miles of Cape Roca, where she was left in comeany of a French steamer. There was every probability of the bark arriving in Lisbon early on the evening of the 30th, the wind beiDng from the northward.
			On the 29thshe exchanged signals wlth Her Majesty!sship Amphlon, inlat. 36.37 N.,long. 8.15 W.; andthe same day, in 1st. 36.29, long. 7.49, with the American bark Daniel, bound to the westward.

			The -British schooner Pioneer, from London, with .Government stores for Gibraltar, arrived out on the 24th. The Margaret and the Peterel, fromLiverpool, and the Eugh and the Hebden, from Newcastle, ni laden with coals, had also arrived.
			The master and crew (six in number) of the Datch galliot Greltze Wemhoff, coal-laden, 94 days out from Newcastle for Marseilles, which vessel foundered at sea in lat. 38, long. 6 50 E.,were landed at Gibraltar on the 92d by the Dutch steamer Rhine, bound from Messina andPalermo for Rotterdam.
			The British brigantine Qtueen of the West, Captain S. Tregarthen, from Milo for Newcastle, with a cargo of srl- pbur, arrived at Gibraltar on the 26th ult. Captain Tre- garthen made the following report:-" During the passago down from MlEo observed a raft, with three men on it, 40 miles N.?E. of Cape Bon. Having taken the poor feol lows off I learned that they belonged to the Greek brig Archimedles, of and bound to Syra, with a cargo of coals from Cardiff. The brig had struck on Reef's Reef, near Maritime, at 4 o'clock in the morning of the 28th of Fe bru- ary. Theosrvivors had been on the raft wlthout food for six d&amp;iys, and when rescued were [reduced almost to tthe last extremity. The captaLinand five ofthe crew wereodrowned, the,only survivors being the mate and two seamen found on the raft, who have been landed here." Captain Tregarthen andhliscrew treated the poor snfferers with that kindness so characteristic of British seamen.
			The Dutch schooner Maria Spec Moo, Captain Vaalman, took the master and crew of the bark Baronet, of KL-kaldy, who were landed at Gibraltar on-the 2lth ult, The follow. mng is the report of the less of the hark :
			" The Baronet, David Lone rmater, was from Liverpool bound to Bona, in Algeria, with a cargo of coat. On the 12th Inst., in the Bay of Biscay, a heavy sea struck, the bark, washing away bolwarks, stanchiona, displacing boeat
			breaking skylight, and flling the cabin with water. From that date to the 16th all hands, day and night, were con- tinually at the pumaps in consequence of a leak ; and on this latter day the master, finding the water gaining on the pups andl the vessel gradually sinking, hoisted a flag of ditess, whenL the Maria Spes Mena hare down, and suc ceeded in taking Captain Lamb and his crew on hea-rd from their own beats. Half an hour after the Baronet was seen to founder, in lat. 44, long. 11. W."
			Captain Lamh expressed his gratitude to Captain Vaal- man for the kidndness he received from him and his crew.

			The m-eatgf-war wrere thou to proceed to the Bay of Tan- gier for 4epurpose of making a combined simultaneoos attack by land and sea on that City. The subsequent sign-
			g of the peace, however, prevented this arrangement being carred into execution The baggage was again landed on the 26th at Port Martn. The sea was so rough that many of the launches belonging to the transports engaged in landing provisions, &amp;c., were upset by the heavy surf, and an immense amount of Droperty Is said to have been lost.
			It Is stated thati n the action of the 2Sd the Moors stoodl the Spanish bayonet charge with undaunted valour. The Catalonian volunteers, whose effective strength was 250 men, are Eaid to have had 200 men put hors de combat.
			Upwards of 200 troops, wounded in the engagement of the 23d, were landed at the Orange Grove on the 26th. They were conveyed tohthe San Roque hospitals. Fifteen of the wounded soldiers died on te passage previously to the steamersreaching the Spanish coast. Another batch of wounded reached Algeciras on the morning of the 27th, others having been conveyed to Cadiz and Malaga.
			The whole of the Spanish men-of-war, incInding the Princesa de Astuuras steam frigate, bearing Admiral Bus- tlllos'aflag, as well as the fleet of steam and other transports that were off Tetuan, had, owing to the strong east wind, gone to the Puente MEayorga for shelter.
			The Gibralsar Chroenidc of the 28th nlt. says
			" The gratifying intelligence given in yesterday's number regarding the prellminaries of peace havlng been signed by fiuley Abbas and the General-in-Chief of the Spanish army of operations in Africa, thus putting an end to further effunon of human blood, is fully corroborated by a letter re- ceived after the hour of publication, written by a trust- worthy officer who was present with his corps at the esagni- nary battle of the 23d inst. It is dated from the camp near the Fondac, March 25 12 o'clock noon, and Is as follows .-
			" ' I have to than the Almighty for having spared me once more, after the bloody battle fought the day before yes- terday. dur losses have been great, very great! It is be- lieved that they must have amounted to at least 1,500 men between kIlled and wounded- The lOss of the Moors is esti- mated at nearly 5,000. We yesterday rested while the Moors presented themselves to have a parley; and to-day, at last, peace has been made. At the hour I am writing the General-in-Chief notifies the happy event to the whole army. It is believed that we shal very soon return to
			Spain.
			"We glean the following particulars from a private letter dated Tetuan, March 24, 8 am
			"'The state of the roads between the port of Martin and Tetuan was very unsafe, and the people were afraid of their lives, 5s only 4,000 men remained to garrison the postions from the beach to the town. It was given as posi- tive in Tetuan that the loss of the Spaniards in the battle of the 23d was estimated at upwards of 2,000. The writer believes they could not be less, judging by the very large numbers of wounded that he saw continually brought in. The Catalonian volunteers are said to have had only 40 men left intact out of theirnumber. The Madrid LightInfantry suffered very severe losses. The Biscayan volunteers were also engaged, and bad a great number killed and wounded. The First and Second Commandants of the Catalonians were wounded, hut whether severely or slightly is not stated. The civil population, by an order from the Spanish autho-
			ities, were prohibited leaving the tovn.d"'
			The Algecirsa Hojcs SzeU gives the following details of the battle of the 23d:
			"The Moors, posted on the heights of Gualdras, were the irst to open a terrific fire upon our troops, who attacked them with unequalled boldness. Th. enemy kept firm bravely defending his camp for several hours. Generai Echague advanced with the first corps, flanked by General Rios's division, whose forces jointly sustalned the brunt of the combat, while General Ros de Olano occupted the centre, and General Prim the other flank.
			"In the meantime the Moors had dared to make a move- ment, endeavouring to surprise or to turn the flank- of General Rios's division, but they attacked him rashly, and all was in vain, their efforts being thwarted ab the point of the bayonet by our brave soldiers, though inflicting some Eevere losses on the battalions more exposed to the fire of the enemy. The heights were successively taken, and there were moments of a pell-mell and confusion fn which bayonets and qusnias crossed. We caused them an awful and very considerable carnage.
			"General Prim's division twice took a donar which was most tenaciously defended by the enemy, untU the General ordered it to be set on fire.
			"In one of the charges made by the Ctirassiers of El Principe their commander, Senor Pojada, was killed.
			"The Moors commenced retreating, but, being harassed by Generals Echague's and Prim's divisions, they took to
			flight.
			* The battalions wbich have suffered most are the Tarifa and Madrid, and the Saragossa Regiment."
			The R6e also publishes the following from the Minis- ter of the Interior:-
			"Camp of Gualdras, March 25, 1 p.m.
			Yesterday the envoys of Muley Abbas again presented theniselves as the bearers of a letter, in which earnest de- sires for peace were manifested and demanding an inter- view, which was acceded to on condition that the proposi- tions already sent should be accepted, and that the hour of meeting be notified before half-past 6 on the following morning, for at that hour the troops would be on the march. The emissaries did not keep us waitina, long; the tents were already struck, and the troops ready to move, when news was received that the Caliph would come to the interview between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning ; this actually took place, and he was received in a tent pitched at a distance of G00 paces from our advanced posts,
			"March 25, 2 p.m.-The preliminaries of peace and the celebration of an armistlce hai becn signed to-day, the anry proceeds to station Itself withinthe line of Buseja's Bridge, which Is the divisory one,-a position easily and quickly assisted and provisioned."
			Accounts from Iazagan to the 23d ult. state that the commercil transactlons between the Moors in the country and the townspeople continued pretty steady, notwithstaud- ang the unsettled state of the interior, where great effer- vescence among the wild tribes was spoken of. Wool and hides find their way into the market of the town, where there seemed to be a good demand for these articles. The pro- hibition of the export of wheat, decreed by the Moorish Goe vernment on account of the war with Spain, continued in full force; but the grain parchased and stored by foreign agents previous to this order was allowed free course. The Diana, Lombard master, was in port, expecting to load a cargo of woul for Gibraltar. Other vessels were expected, the car- goes of which, consisting of wool, skins, &amp;c., were ready for shipment. About the middle of the month one of the Emperor's youngest brothers, named Muley Dris, about 22 years of age, paid a flying visit to Maragan, accompanied by a strong escort of cavalry, well mounted and equipped ; and, after going through some evolutions in presence of the peo- ple of the town and taking some rest, the Prince paid a vislt to Mr. Redman in town, and then proceeded with his escort to that gentleman's country residence, where he took up his quarters. All the other seaports on the coast of Barbary are reported to be in the enjoyment of tran- quillity.

			A P.REVISIONV OP THE LITURGY.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-You were good enough to give publlity to a letter from me a short time since, commenting upon the strange jumble of irrelevancies and repetitions which occurs in our Ash Wednesday Services. I request now to be allowed to do the smoe in reference to the service for this day, from which I am just returned. It did not occupy an hour, and yet we had the Lord's Prayer three times, three prayers for the Queen, two coUects twice over, two Supplications for all estates of men, and two final benedictions. As there are no proper Psalms, or option given of selection to the officlating ininizter, we had those appointed for the 2d of the month, vhlch have no particular reference to a penitential season; and we might have faUen on others as incongruous as pos- Eible.
			Yet I grieve to say that a majority of the prelates of the Canterbury Convocation, men of great influence, and of whom I desire to speak with the respect which I entertaln For them, have declared that, as far as they are concerned, no chango whatever shall be made in these arrangements. In reference to this subject I venture to quote a second time irom the writer in tho Church of England *Uonthly, to
			bheu I had recourse upon a former occasion. In urging upon Convocation the necessity of revision, he makes use of the following wvords:-
			" Is the Church like a rlceketty building, which the owner dares not repair, lest he bring the whole structure about his ears ? We do not think so, but rather that a well-consl- dered adaptation of the venerable fabric to the new circum- stances of its tenants will prove as safe as it is necessary. We fear far more the additional strength thrown Into the hands of the revolutlonary element in our Church by every denial of much needed reform. Extremes meet, and in Church as In politics the best friends of the demagogue are these who stiffly deny even to friends the least amendment of practical grievances. Quieta non nseere is a maxim which has its danners when appliaed as one of our bishops has ap. plled It. The quiet obtained by withholding what is in Itself demanded by reason or policy is hut temporary, and pur- c.hased usually at the price of a future catastrophe. The old institu,tions go,pn, seemlingly as well as usual for a time; hut the 'brcakf, cometh suddenly In an Instant. So far from thinking the present time a wrong one for urging the point, wre think there is no time like the present."
			Your obedient servant.

			A MAGISTERIAL DE5JNQVM2T.
			Mr. R. W. Eall Dare, J.P. of the county of Slgo, was tried at the Quarter Sessions of Ballymote, on Saturday last, on a charge of having indecently assaulted Elizabeth Montagu, an Englishwoman, the wife of Thomas Montagu, Mr. Dare's under-game- keeper. The jury took a long time to deliberate, hut eventually they brought in a verdict of guilty of common assault. In passing sentence, the Assistant- B3arrister (MIr. Harstonge Rtobinson) said;-
			Ha Mr. H Dare, a very Painful duty devolves upon me. You have been found gulty of a common assault, and I have consulted my brother magistrates, and we consider it to be our duty to impose upon yon a punishment that will mark our disapprobatlon of your conduct, and show to the public that, no matter how high the positlon of a parby unfortunately guilty of such an offence, the law must take Its course with regard to him. For these oonsiderations we feel it to be our duty to sentence you to one month's impri- sonment, and that yen pay a fine of ol. together with 10. which have been Incurred as expenses by the prosecutrir."
			Mr. Hfall Dare, who had ris6n from his seat to receive the sentenCe of the Court, made no observa- tion, and shortly afterwards, in company with the Hub-sheriff, walked across to Doyle'8 hoteL.
			Mr. Dare formerly represented an English county in Parliament, and a few years ago became the pur- chaser, under the Encumbered Estates Court, of the Perceval property, in the county of Sligo, since which he has re8ided constantly in Ireland. The whole affair has, of course, created great interest in the county of Sligo.

			T;HE TssAx SUBSConareON CLU.-Yesterday evening the members of this club, established aboutifive years ago with the view to encourage the practice of the noble art of rowing,b eldtheir anniversary festival at the Freemasons' Tavern. The Hon. G. Denman, MSP., the president of the institution, acted as chairman, and among the invlted guests, of whom there was a goodly number, were Mr. Serjeant Shoe, Sir Wiliam Fraser, ,Mr. Serjeant Sisglalce MYP Mr. Johm Locke, MP.T, Mr. Lush, Q.C., Mr. Hug'es, the author of Tom BraTzen' School-days, and six of the Oxford crew wvho competed in the recent Unl- versity boat race on the Thames. The Cambridge crew had been invited, and would have been present but for the strin- geny of the regulations which compelled their return to the University. On the removal of the cloth the cus- tomary loyal and constitutional toasts were drunk with acclamation, the chairman remarking, as a matter for congratulation, that the Prince of Wales himself was a member of the Oxford University boat club, and used to keep a four-oar of his own upon the Thames, in order to enjoy the noble and gallant pastime of rowing. Mr. Serjeant Kimglake, in responding to the toast of ' The members of the House of Commons," amused the company by relatinog some of the boating exploits in which he took part in early life at Cambridge, and how on one occasion in par- ticular he acted as captain of an open six-oared boat, built under his own superintendence, which was rowed from Deal to Calais and back again, adding that on the return voyage having a spare oar, hoand his crew could not find in ali Calais a Frenchman who would consent to take it. He stated alo, that on a recent gala day at Eton he heard the Duke of Malakhoffremark,onseeingtheEtonboys row, that now he knew where the gallant officers who fought the battles of the English in the Crimea were trained. The chairmAan, in proposing the toast of the even- ing, adverted to the gratification he had felt, as one long accustomed to aquatic pastimes, on witnessing the gallant struggle on the Thames on Saturday between the crews from the sister Universities. From the start until they had paesed over good two miles and a half of water, it was Impossible, he said, for any person expe- rienced3 in rowing to say with any certainty which
			of the two would vin the race, so keenly was every, inch of the course contested. The general feellng among boating men who with himself witnessed the race was that the Oxford men did their best, but that, in spite of that, the were beaten by a crewr who did bettor than theselves. MAlr. Baxter, one of the Oxford crew, whose name was coupled with the toast, responded to the compliment in a speech replete with modesty and good feel- ing. Generously acknowledging the pluck and skill of the Cambridge men, he expressed his conviction that the Oxford crew, of whom he was one, did their best, adding that they rowed in the race not for any paltry repntation of their own, but for the honour of their University, a sentiment which was loudly cheered. They were fairly beaten, he said, not by any fault of their own, bnt though beaten they were not discouraged. Mr. Serjeant Shee, Lleutenant Lon-dale, of the Inns of Court Rifle Coaps, Air. T. Hughes, Mr. John Locke, M.P., and other gentlemen addressed the company In the course of the evening on subjects germane to the club. The band of the Scots FusUeer Guards was in attendance.
			THIE AccsnnrT oN THE EASTERN Cousins RAm- w"-Av.-The adjourned inquiry into the cause of the death of George Alexander Falconer, who expired on the 11th of March from injuries sustained by the accident at Totten- ham on the 20th of February, was resumed yesterday after- noon before Mr. Humthreys, in the Sir John Cam Tavern, Victoria-road, South ackney. Mr. Serjeant BaUantine ap Reared for the Eastern Counties Railway Company and Mr Hlumphreys (of Humphrey, Morgan, and Co.) for the widow of the deceased. The greaternumberofthescientific gentlemen connected with rallways and the manufacture of iron who gave evidence at the Tottenham Inquiry were also present. The only new evidence of a scientific kind which was pro- duced, was that which wras given by Sir Charles Fox. In answrer to questions by Mr. Hmmphreys, Sir Charles stated that he had. exsmined with prat care the tire which had broken and occasioned the accident. The fracture had been occasloned by a weld which had never been perfect, but ho was of opinion that if the tire of the wheel had been properly blocked it would have given certain indicationswhich would have informed a careful workman that a defect existed. In cross-examination by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Sir Charles said that very small defects in tires might re- main undetected by the system of blocking he had referred to, but he thoupht the defect which caused the accident was onginally too large not to have given indications of its existence. Mr. Harrison, an engineer, Mr. Fenton, tho manager of the Low Moor iron works, and Mtr. Beattle, engineer on the South-Westemr Railway, were then called by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, and each of them gave an opinion disagreeing with that of Sir Charles Fox. The coroner havig carefuUy summed up, the jury returned the following verdct :-" That George Alex- ander Falconer died on the 11th day of March, and that his death arose fromt the upsetting of a certain locomotive en- Rine on the Eastern Counties Railway, and that the upset- ting of the said locomotive engine was caused by a wheel being used whereon was a defective tire)'

			LAW REPOBR.
			CONSISTORY COURT. ArRm 3.
			TEE CASE OF ST. GEORGE'S-IN-THE-BAST.
			(Before Dr. Twms , Q..)
			= OFIOCE OF JU1DGE, PHOSIOTED BY wG, V. RO .
			The Rev. Bryan King, rector of St. Georgels-in-the-East, exhibited ardclos against Robert Rosier, a parishioner, " for brawling, quarrellng, and chidling in tho parish church" on Sunday, the 14th of August, and on Sunday, the 6th of November, 1859. In the third ertole the defendant was charged with having on the 14th August, during the cele. bration of afternoon servIce, at 4 p.m., when the Rev. Mr. Burn, who was officiating, fainted or fell down in a fit, in a brawling, chiding, and Irreverent maner ehouted out, 'It is a judgment from God upon him; Godahas strack him dead; down wlth Bryan King P' In the fourth article he was charged with havlng upon the 6th of November, immediately upon the conclusion of the afternoon service, and before the congregation haddispeseed, pointed at a member of the congregation named Savage Hall, and said, In an Irreverent and brawling tone and manner, " This thing caUs himself a captain. He is a dis- grace to the army; he is a greasy swell," and with having said to another person named Blat'bford, " This is the man who is going to swear I spat upon him at Welldose-square." Mr. Rosier had given in a negative issuo to these allegation.
			I Dr. P zM Toxx, Q.C., with whom was Dr. Swabey, in his opening, sald that if the evidence sustained the aver- menth the present case would have a bad pro-eminence not only as the most gross and scandalous case of brawling that had ever occurred, but because it was notorious that the acts charged formed a link in the chain of a system which had brought greater disgrace on the metropolis than anything since the Gordon Riots. The circumstances which had lead to the suit were unhappily so notorious that it was needless to detaUthem. The Rev. Mr. King was Instituted In September' 1842. is parish contained a population of about 27,000, and amnong them were some of the worst characters in Lon. don; It had been ascertained that ont of 733 houses in the parish 154 were brothels and 40 were publichouses and heershops. Mr. King's predecessor had kept no curate, and talcen ittle part in the ministration. Mr. King had kept from three to six curatest had established two mision chapels and a refuge for pemtent women, and had three or four services a-weL This, therefore, was a proper case for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court for the protec- tion of a clergyman and for the prevention of a system of profanation, blasphemy, and outrage without a parallel in the history of any Christian country.
			Mr. Rosier conducted his own case, having refused the offer of the Court to provide him with counsel. At the con. elusion of Dr. Phillimore's openlighe expressed his surprise and regret that his case was not to be decided by a jury.
			Thomas John Nash, a bootmaker and parishioner of St. George's-In-the-East, was then examined, and said that on the afternoon of the 14th of August last he was in the parish church of St. George. The rector's service began at 4 o'clock. Ar. Burn was reading the service. Wtuese. was standing near the reading desk. He did not know any one in the church. There was a great deal of nolse durin the service. As 31r. Burn was reading the Litany he foi down In a fit. There was a rush forward. He moved with the people, and was brought into close contact with Mr. Rosier, who said, In a very loud tone, " God has struck him dead; It is a just judgment onhim." -Mr. King went on with the Litany, in front of the altar ; but the nolse was so great -hisdsng hooting, and cries of " No Popery"-that nothing could be heard. When the Litany was finished there was a general rush, and he was carried off his feet down the side aisles. There was a mob of about 150 persons, and they were crying out at Captain Hall, "Pitch him down the steps." He never saw Rosier before that Su nday.
			In cross-examination by Ifs. RosiEx the witnes deniedl that he was a Jesuit or a Roman Catholic. He certainly considered the oath he had taken binding.
			Captain Savage Hall, formerly of the 7th FusUeers, said that he was not a parishioner of St. George's-in-the-East; he was p eetat the aftemnoon service on the 14th of August. He first sat under the reading desk, but afterwards stood uP. After Mr. Burn fell down the crowd in the centre sie moved forward and carried him with them. Mr. Rosier was at his right hand, less than a yard distant. He called out In a loud voice, " It is a judgment from God on him." The people called out, "Down with the Pope, and down -with old Bryan King."1 The rector read the rest of the service, but it could hardly be heard. The choristers went to the north aisle, and the people in the centre aisle rushed after them. When he gotto the saptistr7 door a struggle took place between him and Rosier. There were summonses taken out on both ddes, and they both 'went before the magistrate. The church was shut up until the 6th of November. He attended the service on that day at a quarter before 3I o'clock. Rosier was sitting in one of the choir seats. The Litany and resonses were chanted. Rosier and the boys called out the responses In atumultuous way, In such a manner as to interrupt the service. As Rosier was leaving the church witness stood to let him pass by, and he pointed at him and said, " That thing calls himself a captao. Hoe Roa greasy swell, and a dssgrace to the armY ? Where's your umbrella S" RHsier then said to Mr. Blatchford, " That feoow will swear anything. He was going to swear that I sPat On him in Weaelose. square." Neitrhe ho nor Mr. Blatchford had done any- ting to provoke Rosier. Theraewas an attackn Mad on the choristers on the 14th of August. Rosier wos one of the leaders of the mob.
			Cross-exagained.-He lived at Soho. Hre had been askd to dine at the rectory on the 14th of August. He had gone to the church to assist in keeping order. He had dined with others who had gone for the same purpose in the mis. sion house. He was not a Jesit, and he consldered his oath bidn.He was not kneelig when Mr. Burn fell.

			frmthis charge she brought the action. Itwa
			tried in this city in the year 1853 before Lord camp. bell ,and resulted in averdict for the plaintiff. About the same time the defendant in this action wvas also employed by Jane Burton to defend her agabinst a charge of forgery which had been made 2gainst her and which charge was dismissed by the maggistrates. TIhese charges against her servants, both of whom were great favourites, caused Miss Mann great uneasiness, and inL the cours of the frequent interviews which she had with the defendant uponL this sub- ject she became very favourably im re-sed with his assiduity and intelligence. The.defendanta~ter this constantly came to Lynn, and on several occasions saw Miss Mann About this time that lady appeared to have conceived some recent. ment against Mfr. Weston Jarvis on account of his advising her with some pertinacity to get rid of the two Burtons, and some other interference of a petty description In bar domestic affairs. Of these, according to the defendlant's statement, she mnade frequent complaint to him, and eventually, in the month of April, 184 she Informed H im that she Intended to revoke her will in Mr. Whfim. cop Jarvis's favour, and to leave her property to himself; and requested the defendant to prepare a will accordingly. This, the defendant said, he at first refused to do ; but Miss Mann insisting upon it on several occasions, he at length acceded, upon-the condition that two responsible witnesses were called in to witness the execution of the will. The defendant then said that Kiss Mann gave Into his hands the wil made' by her in favour of Mr. Jarvls, which he read over, mark-ing In pencil 'he alteratiouswhichMIlssMann suggested, the effect of which was to substitute the defendant's name in the place of that of Mr. Whincop Jarvis as residuary devisee, to leave two legacies of 4001. to the Messr. Jarvis, and to introduce a clause by which, instead of the separate document already alluded to, 8001. vwa directed to be expendedi for the benefit of the chapelatTylneySt. Lawrence; in other respects the will was the same as before. The mexecuters of this wil were Mr. Loppings and Mr. Carter, gentlemen of high re- spectability residing at Lynn. The attestfing witnesse, two medical gentlemen residing at Lynn, and other medical gentlemen and others acquainted with Miss Mann, were called, and were unanimous In expressing theiropinlon that Miss Mannm, althouigh somewhat capricious and self-willed, was perfectly competent to make a wll.
			At the conclusion of the evidence In support of the will, a long legal argument ensued upon points pu~r4ely technical, which were ultimately reserved by his Lrdship for the consideration of the Court of Oueen's Bmenh.

			This was an action for the alleged wFrongful dismiasa of the plaintiff from his situLation of commercial traveller to tho defendants. The defendants arc tea merchants at Liverpool and London. The plaintiff had, previous to N'ovember last, been about 'two years in the defendant's service as a clerk, at 2001. a year. Th that month the plaintiff was engaed to travel in Scotland in the firm at a salary of 5001. a-Year, PaYing his own expenses, which it was consdaered need not exceedL 2501.,three months notice of terminating the contract to he glven: 251, was advanced him on account of salary. After being on a journey for abouit five weeks, durlng which he received several sums of money, exceeding in the whole 2001., for the defendants, he was called on to account for and pay over the same to the London house. This he was unable to do by the sum of 891. He attribuited his inabilty to pay up this sum to the expenses that he hadl incurred in travelling and partly to treating the custoraers of the firm. It also appeared that lhe had joined a volunteer artil- lery corps, which Mrt. Henry Steams, the London partner, characterized as keing a piece of extravagant tomfoolery In a person in the plaintff's position. To meet the 891. it was proposed that the plaintiff shouldl give an order on the Liverpool honse to transferthat amount on his account to the London house. This would have been done if the plaintiffs salary for the time had amounted to as mnuch but hids salary, reckconed up to the day, being ouly 591., the Liverpood house refusedl to make the requisita transfer. Under these circumstances the dfxatsum maanly dismnissed the plaintiff without notice.
			For the defence it was contended that the plaintidt ought to have made the 251. paid to him on account meet all his proper expenses during the time that hie had been in the situation, andt that he should consequently have been able to pay ~ the foil amaount of the money re- ceived for his emploers, and that not having done so, and having also incuired expense for reglmentals, &amp;o., In entering the ridle corps, the defendants were, without im.
			puig any dishonesty to the plaintiff, justified In dismlssn hVim or not, according to his duty, paying over when cZl on monies received f or his employers.
			The defendants and their bookkeepers having been exa- mined for the defence, and the learned counsel having summed up and replled on behalf of their respective clients,
			HIS LORDsss summed up, observing that in orde to make out the dlefence it was not necessary that defendearnts should show that the plaintiff embezzled theilr money or had been goilty of dishonesty, but only that. he received money on their account and failed to account for and pay over the same when calledon. e bed no right to mix upthe salary to be paid to him with the money received by him for his ployers. The question was whether on the 31st of December the defendants did cail on plaintiff to account and pay over the balance. On that day the precise amount of salary -was 691., but the amount for which the defendant proposed to give en order on the Liver- poeel house was 301. mnore. Was that a payiag ever the balance? He (the learned Judge) thought It was net, and that a sufficienit cause existed for dismissing him. But another question then arose, which was, did the defendants dismiss for that cause?a Or having forgiven him for not then paying that balance, dia they dimiss him for some other reason? If &amp;e, the defence wTould -not be mnade out, and the plaintiff would he entitled to a verdict for the amount of the quarter's salary, les the probable epnehewuld have incurred in travelling for the plain- tif uigtat time, and the value which the jury might thnkhi hvi that tie at his own disposal might have been t-o him.

			G}:UFEb, ADMUIISTrtATIX, V. THE GREAT WESTERX RAIL-
			lWAY COMPANY.
			biZ Al. bSlade, AMr. Coleridge, and Mr. Kfingdon were coun- sel for the plaintiff ; Mlr. Butt, Mr. Smith, and Mr. iKas- lake were counsel for the compay.
			This was an action broughitby the Wife, as adMsninitratrix of a Mfr. James Griffin, to recover damgson behalf of herself and six children for loss susaied in conse- quence of her husband being kfied on the defendants' rail- way by the negligence of their servants.
			The facts of the case as they appeared from the evidence of the witnesses were as follows:-llr. Griffin was a florist at Bath, in a large way of business, and on the 8th of September in the last yea there was a flower show at Swindoni. Mr. Griffin was an exhfibiter on that occasion, and obtainedl several prizes, among others a sUlver cup. In the evening he returned toBath in company with some friends who were also exhibitors at Swindou b the mail train, wvhich arrived at Bath at about ii o'clock. On the arrival of the train it stopped, and Mr. Griffin put his handl out and openedl the door of the carriage in order to alight, wheu without any notice the train was basked by a sudden jerk, and Mlr. Griffin, having his foot on the atep of the carriage, was thrown down and dragged uner the carriaaes, and received such injories that ho died wvitisiA three hours of the time of the accident. Several witnesses were called who corroborated the -above fac-ts, and lleed hatno ignl ws gventhat the train was abou tomove an wee sujeced t a ros-exainaionto proe tat hetran bd verhot te satin,and that a notce as ive no toqut te crriges asth train was On the part of the defendants a nesmber of witnesses were celled to show that every precaution was tak-en that could be, and that the accident arose entirely frosm the negligence
			of the man himself, -who got out of the carriage in defiance1 of a caution that was given to the passengers to k-eep their seats.
			Mr. Baron MaAInTx told the jury that the question was one entirely for them as to which aide they believed, as the evidence was as contradictory on the main point as it pos- sibly could be.
			The jury retired, and, after an absence of about two hours founds verdict for the defendants.
			One more spcial jury case, partly heard, remained for tra tte lg of the Court.

An aztive inquiry was at once Instituted by the police, and It re-ulted that a art, with three men in it, ha been seen to drive away from the street door early in the morning, while a clue was fallen upon which led to negetia. tions between a Mr. Loveridge, a silk factor, and a man (name unknown) for the purchase of a qpeLtlty of slk which was supposed to be that stolen. This m3n took Mr. Loveridge to an obscure street in Bethnal-gresn for the purpose of seeing the goods In bulk, but the precau- tion bad been taken to secure the attendance of Detectives Knight andllunnell and a third officer, who, as saon as they sav &amp; fitting oporbunity,dro quletly upon three men as they were bringing the ,lkin parcels to the cab which -hadconveyed r. Loverldge to the spot. Of these three men the prisoner was one, and a man named Angus another- but when the officers attempted to appre- hend them there was a rush of disreputsble char- ters to the rescue, and Angus only was secured, the unknown man escaplng without difficulty, whUe the prisoner, who ws takol:ed by Knight, struggled de,ep rately rollng with the officer over and over re- pe3Ztly, and at last. brealdng away, he rusbed through a grocer's shop, nd escaped by jumping through a bck win- dw, while Kight, in attempting to follow, struck himself egalust the doorpost, and fell hack upon the pavement with g reat violence. Angus we committed for trial from this court, and sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude at the Sep- tembersession,sof the Central Criminal Coat. but nothing more was seen of the prisoner or the third man un- ti the 12th of October, when Knight and EanneU foundtheformerata house in Ayr-street, Bethual-preen, but were again unsuccessful in attempting to arrest him, as he resisted them with great determination, and was again aided in his efforts to escape by a mob of thieves and excited women. More fortunate on the third attempt, Knight with five other officers, found him in bed, secured him, ana conveyed himin safely to the stationhouse. When there the prisoner denied that he had been in any way connected with the robbery, hut admitted that ho wras a great fool to have anyting to dowith the silk, alt.honzh he thought at the time that he might as well make a shilling or two, throagh finding a buyer, as any one else.

			UU DHALL.L-Robert Clox appearea on a summon- for unlawfuly having In his possession property suppose' to have been stolen.
			Mr. Lewis Hoffman appeared for the prosecution, anw Mr. Lewis, jun., for the defence.
			Thlscase arose out ofthe fo'lowing circumstances:-Iathe early pext of last month a Mr. JohnL Thompson, who was stated to have served In the 16th Lancers through the wars of the 1eninmula and the Battle of Waterloo, and stml later on the Crimean campaign, left his home with a quantity of valuable property about him. He was on the same eveanig seen drunk with the defendant as they were leavlng the Hlaunch of Venison, in Bell-yard, Fleet-street, ab)out 9 o'ock,h and about three hours after Thompson was dis- covered insensible on the cellar-stairs in Cox's house, and bleeding from a wound in the head, and he was conveyed to a room at the to p of the house, where Cox was found drank in bed. A medical man was caUed in, bet Thompson only lingered for a few days, and after his death Cox
			laimedeverythingbr elonging to Thompson, alleging ta he washs brother. He ion about to be burled at the parlsh expense, when Mr. PlImer, Thompson's land. lord, interfered, and, finding how he had been woundod, brought the matter under the coroner's notice. An inquest was held, and a verdict returned to the effect that the de. ceased diefrom the wound in the head, but that there was no evidence to show how or by whom it Vas inflicted. Co at the inquest said the deceased gave him his property betfre he died, ut, on being questioned by the Alderman, he (Cox) was about to state wbere and when he and his alleged half-brother Thompson,vere born, when he was interrupted by Mr. Lewi, who, perceiving the drift of these questions, advised the defendant to answer no more.
			Mrx. Lewis objected to the j arisdiction, As the case was one of disputed title, which this court had no power to try.
			Mx. HEofman- said Mr Palmer's claim for board anl lodging was 451.. am4, n Vthe absence of nest of kin, he in- tended to samisAster to the deceased's effects.
			MIr. Lewis said Cox also Intended to administer.
			Alderman Hrrpnsay said, he had no donbtthat Thoin - eon met his death by unfair means. Being drunk he bad boon thrown down stairs and his money tak-en from him. He therefore direteaa the police to make inquires, and to. act upon them accordingly.

			TEHB WITWOORTtandaLARMSTROpRWt GUJYS.
			Since the conclusion of Mr. Whit'orts'5 vaoAeble experiments at Southport a tabular summary of the reault of each trial of the 3, 1�,, and 80-pounders, at different degrees of elevatljon, has been carefully prepared. Tnis table sl'.ows such marvellous results to have been obtain'a with each description of ord- nancee both as rev&lt;,rds range and accuracy, that we give rt to our ieaders in eztenso, in order that they ;ay see that our first estimate of the great power of the Wnitworth gan has been already borne oat by these results.
			The table is as follows
			Smnmary of Eaperiments with Mr. Whitworth's Rifled
			Cannon at Southport, showing the Mean Range and Deviation of all the Shots fired at each Experiment.
			All these experiments, be it remembered, were conducted from first to last by amateur gunners, -without accident or delay of any kind, and during the prevalence of wind and weather both about the most unfavourable that could well be imagined for obtaining good average results of range alone. As these successes appear to have excited the attention of engineers and scientific artillerists throughout Europe, and, above all, of the many supporters of the Armstrong principle for rifled cannon, we feel sure that our readers will be interested in our again referring to this sabject.
			Since the great success of the WVhitworth gun was first published in this journal, that gentleman has continued to demonstrate the scientific principles on which his ordnance are constructed by elicit- ing from fresh experiments a regularly pro- gressive increase of range and accuracy. N1r. Sidney Herbert has therefore stated in the House that as the Whitworth guns had exceeded the Armstrong in range, and very nearly, as far as could be judged from the rough experiments, equalled it in accuracy, the Government were prepared to take the usual steps to give both a competitive trial at Shoebury- ness. This verv fair decision of the War-oflice has given rise to some dissatisfaction among many of the supporters of the Armstrong gun, who allege that 3iir. WVhitworth has only obtained greater range by reducing the diameter of his projectile, and, of course, therefore, the bore of the canuon itself; quite forgetting that, as long as that gen- tleman can prove that a great improvement is brought about by the adoption of certain principles, the public andt the military authorities will care very little whether the principles themselves are new or old. By.31r. Whitworth's plan of reducingthedia- meter of the shot, and therefore the bore of thegun, he contends that not only are the range and accuracy increased, but the gun itself can be constructed of the same relative strength of metal though nearly two-tbirds lighter than the ordinary brass guns. The value of this reduction in weight, by allowing fewer horses and fewer men to manceuvre heavier gumn at greaterspeed, must be apparent to any one, more especially to those who have seen what a very little way the largest transports in the service go towards transporting two or three ordinary field batteries, with their present complement of 21 waggons and carriages, 2.50 horses, and some 250 men. The celebrated three-pounder gun of Vhitworth, with carriage and limber complete, could be brought into action and manceuvred and served with the utmost rapidity by two horses and two men only. In this respect, however, the Whitworth gun has no advantage over that of Armstrong; on the contrary, as far as we have yet seen, the Armstrong large guns are much lighter. It has been stated as a kind of objection to the almost astounding results both for range and accuracy which M1r. Whitworth' ob- tained at Southport wvith such small charges of powder, that Sir William Armstrong had only con- structed his ordnance with a view to securing ac- curacy, and that had he chosen to construct a mgn for range alone he would have distanced Mr. Whit- worth in that reFpect. In the articles which ap- peared in Tti, Times on the manufacture of the Armstrong gun, we pointed out the futility of the diffierence which is sometimes mought to be drawn between the terms "1lonarange" and "great accuracy," when in truth they nmean one and the same thing. Guns are only made with one object, which is, after all, that of throwing their shot in the straightest line, and it therefore of necessity foUlows that the gun which can send its shot furthest in a straight line secures the greatest accuracy by attain- ing the greatest range. To suppose that any ord- nance can be made for long range and not attain certain accuracy also is to suppose it possible that the mere a shot deviates from a straight line, the greater wiU be the distance it can eventually accomplish,- a proposition which we think few will ventLre to support. Sir William Armstrong himself, how- ever, is far too experienced a gunner to have su- gested this difference between range and accuracy which has been so hastily advanced by some of his many admirers. He states that beyond a certain distance range for general purposes has no practical valhe, and that as for artillerymen firing in the field at objects five miles distant, without any clue -to guide them but their eve, they might as well fire at the moon. It is not onily a qnestion of which shot goes furthest, but what the shot efects when it does reach the mark. The formation of his gun, he states, bas not been his chief or only object, which, in fact, has been as much directed to invent- ing the most destructive projectile.
			To secure this all-important object, he has been compelled to give up to a certain extent the attain- ment of an immense range, and increase the diame- ter of his gtn in order to enable it to carry the Armstrong shell, which for terrible destructiveness deserves to be almost more celebrated than the gun itself. Thus be states that as yet no fair comparison can be drawn between the results he has achieved while trying only for destructive effect, and the re- sults obtained by a gun wbich was merely fired for r-ange.
			The real test as to their merits both he and iMIr. 'Whitworth very justly maintain can only be got by putting the two guns side by side, and trying them under similar conditions for range, accuracy, and above all for destructive effect. It has been suggested that there is room in the service for both the Armstrong and Whitworth guns, as each weapon has its peculiar attributes and its peculiar supporters. This, however, is taking a view of the case in which we think neither the public nor the War-offlice is at all likely to agree. Sir William Armstrong claims to have constructed his gun on certain fundamentalprinciples ; these Mr.Whitwvorth disregards, and forms his gun as unlike Sir William's in principle as two guns can wvell be. Now, both these ordnance cannot be right, and whichever comes out of the trials at Shoeburyness triumphantly- whether it be the Whitworth or Sir William's-that is the gun to be eventuaUy adopted in both ser- vices as soon as is consisteut with the present im- mense demand for rifled ordnance of almost any kind.
			Each gun, as w e have said, is so essentially different In its principles, that, except that they are both gruns, and both breech-loaders, there is no other point of similarity betwveen them. The Armstrong _s made of coils of wrought iron joined into one tube, the pitch of its rifling is one turn in 10 feet, and its rifling itself is 3S fine sharp grooves. The breech is formed by a long chamber fitting on to the end of the gun, info which works a powerful hollow screw, wbich, when screwed up, jams the breech-piece, which is dropped before it, into the end of the tube, and so makes the perfect gun. The conical shot is, of course, compotnd,-that is, coated P.t the shoulder and base with rings of lead, to
			enable the soft metal to take the rifling. These I rings of lead are expensive as compared with iron, and difficult to fLx, and the shot must be driven through the hoUow screw into the breech of the g,un with care, or accidents would be likely to
			bappen which might spoil the rifling of the nun. The friction on the shot in taking, the rifling is enormous, and to this the recoil of the gun was at one time supposed to be due. But this was a
			istake, for, allowing for the difference of weight between guns and projectiles, the recoil of all ordnance must be in mechanical proportion to the velocity with which the shot leaves the gun. That the friction on the shot, however, is very great may be judged from the fact that we have ourselves seen an Armstrong gun, from the muzzle of which not only the rifling, but the metal of the barrel itself had been stripped out in places like so much paper. The Armstrong shell, as a tremendous engine of warfare, i
			never likely to be surpassed in destructivenes, though, we should think, it can be adapted to be used from rified breech-loading cannon of all kinds. This, however, remains to be seen. The WVhitworth gun, as distinguished from the Armstrong, is bored from one solid cylinder of homogeneous iron, a metal which, in our humble judgment, we take to be only another term for soft tough steeL There is no rifling as is generally understood by the term in the bore, which is a plain hexagon, making one complete turn, which varies with the diameter of the gun. Thus there is one turn in about eight feet in the largest guns (from 50 to 120 pounders), one com- plete turn I five feet in the medium sized ordnance (12 to 32 pounders), and one complete turn in three feet four inches in the small guns, or from three to 12 pounders. AU the guns above 18- pounders are hooped round with rings of iron forced on by hydraulic pressure-an additional strength which is apparently not required, and which in weight gives the Armstrong guns of the same calibres a most important advantage. The breech-loading arrangement is a hinge at the end of the gun supporting a hoop of iron, in which is the breech or cap which screws on to the end of the piece, according to the way in which we have so often described it to our readers already. The shot is of cast iron, and in form precisely like a ninepin, with its thickest part at the middle pared off to fit with mechanical precision the hexagonal sides of the bore. Thus the projectile has a bearing surface on the whole of the barrel, and runs freely in or out of the gun, so that in case of an enemy's shot striking the breech and jamming the screw, or other injury to it, the gun could be used as a muzzle-loader with the same f %cility as an ordinary smooth- bore field-piece. We need scarcely say that this is not the case with the Armstrong, any- thing happening to the arrangement of the breech at once rendering the gun useless till another breech is fitted on at the factories at Elswick or Woolwich. No exertion of force which could be applied to the gun in the field would get the shot down the barrel of the Armstrong; and nothing short of the pressure of several tons would suffice to overcome the friction which is offered by the double rings of lead to the exit of the shot at the muzzle. With the Whitworth gun there is no chamber for the reception of shot and powder, and no rings-an advantage of the utmost im- portance. The Armstrong chamber adds to the length of the gun, without being rifled or assisting in impelling the shot in any way. With the Whit- worththe gun is rifled throughout its entire lenath from end to end, and every inch is used to aid thE flight and give rotation to the projectile. From the chamber in the Armstrong being of a certain size, it follows that only shot of a certain length can be used. In the Whitworth, on the contrary, it is con- tended that shots of any length, or a charge of powder of any strength, can be used indifferently. Thus the three, 12, and 80 pounders are, in fact, only guns of the calibre we mention as long as they are re-
			RIeduce this enormons range to the distance at which long-range guns are generally used- say 3,000 yards-and the length of the pro- jectiles of these ordnance may be more than doubled, the three-pounder used for 91b. shot, the 12-pounder for 321b., and the 80-pounder for a shot of even 2001b. In naval warfare great weight must be attached to these advantages. Twelve- pounder boat guns could be used as 12-pounders or 30-pounders, according to the distance at which they chose to engage, while ships could douolo- shot or even treble-shot their broadside gans as they closed with an enemy. The onlylimit, in fact, to the number of shots with which the Whit
			worth can be loaded when engaged at close quar- ters is the limit to the strength of the powder to eject them. Thus, in the course of the experiments tried to ascertain this fact, it was found that the three-pounder got rid of 10 shots placed one over another at one discharge, but failed to eject 11, when all the powder in the charge burnt out like a squib through the touchhole, leaving the shots in the gun. In the course of the same experiments MUr. Vhitworth fired from a common howitzer a projectile 10 diameters long, and also fired a small cannon, 22 Inches long, with the pitch of its rifling making one complete turn iu every inch; in fact, the inside of this latter barrel was a perfect screw. Yet the projectile from this had an extraordinary amount of penetration. This fact is so difficult to believe till one sees the rapidity with which the hexagonal shot glides down the most rapid turn of rifling thai one of our COntemDo- raries has actually given credence to the monstrous canard that the Whitworth cast-iron shots have been crushed to fragments by the rifling, and "come forth from the gun in a state of potcder 1 As the Armstrong is now used without sponging oUt, Mr. WVhitworth's advantage in this respect has been neutralized. As regards cost the Armstrong is now being manufactured for as low as 1031. per gun. The cost of the IVhitworth is at present quite double this amount, though it might be redueed to as low as or even slightly lower than the cost of thce Armstrong if the barrel were manufactared of tubes of rolled bar iron, instead of the homogeneous metal, which is very expensive, and certainly for all practical purposes of gunnery is not stronger, we believe, than the wirought iron of Armstrong, or even stronger than the extraordinary wrought iron now making for guns at the Mersey Steel-works at 191. a-ton. If in the trials of the two guns at Shoeburyness the Wbitworth is found to be the best, and is ordered to be adopted, and its tube made on the wrought-iron plan which the Government use with the Armstrong, the only cost, it is stated, of altering the machinery at Elswick and Voolwich to suit the new manufacture would be some 51. or 1 01. for a new form of cutter for the boring, or ratber the hexagonal rifling. Not another part of the maehinery need be altered or even made to move faster or slower, though much of it might be disused altogether. Very many of the supporters of the Armstrong allege that it is useless adopting every improvement as it springs up, and that, after all the trouble of chanae has been taken, a better gun even than Whitworth's may be found before the year is out. This m ay be true. But if the WVar-office is tco adopt this argument, and ignore the valuable inventions which they have got because there may be some other undiscovered ones of which they know nothing at aU, what will become of the service, or when will a step in progress be ever made? Whichever gun is provedto bethebest must owe its superiority to broad scientific prin- ciples, and any further improvement must there- fore be merely a development of the same funda- mental ideas, every step in which renders further progress less probable. If, however, there should be a dozen great improvements made in a dozen consecutive years, tbe public will never grudge the money for a change as long as they are convineed it is for the better. It is the gigantic sums which have been wasted on such rubbish as the Lan- caster guns which make the House of Commons timid of the expediency of ehanges, or at least of those by whom they are carried out. To secure the perfect development of two such in- valuable improvements as those of Armstrong and Whitworth undoubtedly are the country would never flinch from any reasonable sum that might be required. Fortunately, however, whichever is se- lected, no further outlay, it is said,will be necessary in the way of plant or machinery; so we may await without any pecuniary misgiving the result of the forthcoming trials, and the oflicial proclamation as to which gun is the best of the two. This result our readers may depend upon knowing as soon as it is definitely ascertained.

			The 86th (Royal County Down) Regiment, stationed at Gosport, have reedved orders to hold themselves in readi- ness to proceed to Aldershott in about 14 days.
			Brevet-Major Palmer's 1st battery, lst. brigade, garrison ArtiUlery, yesterday lefE Woolwich for Shoeburyness, to relieve Brevet-Major Clifford's 7th battery, 2d brigade, ordered to proceed to Dover. Two additional battorles are about to be added to the depot at Woolwich, to be named the 9th and 10th batteries, for the purpose of embodying the corps of non-effective men employed in the garrison, such as offioers' servants, and men who, under ordinary cir- cumstances, are not subject to parade and dril.
			Since the disuse of corporal punishment, which has been unknown at Woolwich for many months past, it is stated that the crime of desertion is of less frequent occur- rence, as verified by the official returns from the corps of Royal Artillery and Royal Marines, as well as the other divisions of the army stationed at Woolwlch. This is ac- counted for by the known fact of numbers of desertions having been induced solelyby the terror of the lash, which, up to the moment vwhen corporal punishment was ordered to be held in abeyance, was resorted to, in some weeks, every day except Saturday and Sunday.

Ewart, hove in sight at Plymouth about 6 o'clock yesterday (Tuesday) morning, with the wind from the westward, a smart breeze. They came in from sea under their three topsails, and on reaching the west end of the breakwater took in aU canvas, and proceeded under steam to the an- chorage ground, the flagship taking her position well to the westward. At 8 o'clock the flag of Port Admiral Sir Bar- rington Reynolds, E.C.B., was honoured by a salute, which was acknowledged by the Impregnable, 104, Capt. Stewarb, in Hamoaze. This portion of the Chaunel fieet left Lisbon on Friday, March the 23d, In company with the screw steam- ships Edgar, 91, Capt. James E. Hator; Algiers, 91, Capt. George W. D.

The Edgar carried away har main topsollyard on Sunday morning, when crossing the Bay of Biscay. The Edgar and Mersey have lost a man each overboard. On Monday night, off the Lizard, the Fdgar, Algiers, Queen, Mars, and Mersey parted company, and proceeded up Channel for Portsmouth. Very Line weather was experi- enced at first, but within the last four days strong gales from west-north-west have prevailed, with extraordinary heavy seas. All the ships are reported leaky; the Royal Albert will require a thorough caulking. Two Datch ships of war were in the Tagns.
			The Victoria and Albert, Royal paddle-yacht, was yester- day removed from the steam basin to her moorings in Ports- mouth Harbour, where she received her crew preparatory to her intended cruise.
			The Enryalus, 51, screw, Capt. Tarleton, C.B., Was un- docked yestexday from No. 7 dock at Portsmouth, and placed in the steam basin, where she will receive her new boilers, and complete her refit for further service.
			The Vulture, 6, paddle, Capt. George Parker, has been removed from the middle harbour buoy In Portsmouth har- bour, and berthed alongside the sheer jetty, where ehe has conmmenced taking out her masts. She will pay off on Thursday (to-morrow) if possible.
			Rear-Admiral of the White Sir F. Maitland, accom- panied by his future flag-captain, Capt. Mackenzie, yester- day paid a visit to the Bacchante, 51, screw, at Portsmouth, the intended flagship of the gallant Admiral for the Pacific station.

			A TRAGEDY OX TPIE HIGfH SEAs.-On Werdnes- day morning, about 6 o'clock, three men while in the bay off Staten Island, discovered an oyster-sloop with her sails torn to shreds and hanging over her side, which, with the general appearance of the craft, induced them to believe that she had been abandoned. Accordingly, they boarded the sloop, which proved to be the B. A. Johnson, of Islip, Long Island, Her bowsprit was gone, and she was abandoned. The deck was full of clotted blood and hair. On entering tho cabin large pools of blood were found on both sides of the stove, and in the comnpanion way. The starboard quarter on the outside had much blood on it, apparently finger prints. Her boat was gone. In the cabin were found a pair of Indiarubber boots, several shirts, bedding, and a number of other articles, which could have been easily taken away if the vessel had boen honestly aban- doned. The sloop was fast drifting ashore when the steam- tug Ceres, Captain Storens, took her in tow and brought her to the city. An soon as the sloop was brought lnto the Folton-market slip, information was Immediately given to the coroner and Captain Weed of the Seconld Precinct, who boarded her. The deck of the vessel presented the ap- pearance of a slaughterhouse. Everything was covered with blood from stem to stern; matted hair was found upon the deck, and full and complete evidence of a terrible massacre was plain. An examination was next made of the cabin, and the sight here, if possible, was worse than upon the deck. Floor, tables, chairs, and washstand were besmeared with gore, and everything was disarranged, giving evidence of a furlous struggle. A hammer, weiphing about three pounds, was found upon the floor, covered, like all else, with blood. Considerable hair was also found upon It, and it is probable that the assassin or assa&lt;sins used It for the parpose of consummating their villainous deeds. Dr. Bouton, after making a father exa- mination of the cabin, discovered a coffee pot, and this, like the hammer was besmeared with blood and covered with hair. it looks as though the crew, being attacked in the cabin, made a desperate resistance, and that during the struggle aU available means of attack and defence were used. After the examination of the cabin had been concluded the deck was again visited, and a close in- spection of it stilU more satisfied everybody that a barbarous muarder had been committed. From the cabin door there was an unbroken line of blood to the guards; bat there was the appearance of a strnggle;.aa the pool was very large; then, again, marks of bloody hands were seen upon the guard, and a hatchet mark. Blood ran down the oater side also. Forward, at the mast, there was more evidencs of a terrible struggle. A large pool of blood, yet fresh, lay around, extending to the bow ; and here, again, human hair was found. The mast and sails were slightly besmeared, and on the guards, near by, were mnore imprints of bloody hands. Ta ken altogether the scene was a sickening one. The name of the captain of the ill-fated sloop was George
			Burr. He was a man about 34 years of age, andI has a family living at Islip,Long island. He sailed from the foot of Spring. street on the l5th inst.,havingonboard three deck hands, two of whom were named Smith Watts and Oliver Watts; the name of the third party was not ascertained. The, sloop was hound for Virginia for a load of oysters, and it is be- lieved tLat the captain had upwards of $500 in money with him, with which to purchase the cargo. He called at teyport, leaving there on Sunday afternoon, and this was the last seen of the slooD until 3 O'clock on Wednesday morning, when she was run into by the schooner John B. 'Martha, Captain Nickerson, off Staten Tsland. Captain Nickeroon says there was one man aboard her then, who ran towards the bow, as the vessels were about to strike. The sloop struck the schooner about mid- ships, nearly sinking her. No words passed botween the ve'sael and the slGop dropped astern, but when found by the Tegraph. as already stated, outside of Sandy Hook, she was abandoned; Captain Weed gave orders for the arrest of CaPtain Nlckerson and crew of the schooner
			Idartha. There seems tolbobntonetheory asregards this ter- rIble affair. The Johnson had on board a goodI round sum of money. This fast was doubtless known to the river pirates, who, fright-ened loom the East agd Nqorth Rivers by the Harbour Police, have taken refuge on Long and Staten Islands. These villains hadl probably gone on board the sloop at night, '17riced the crew In the cabin, after first

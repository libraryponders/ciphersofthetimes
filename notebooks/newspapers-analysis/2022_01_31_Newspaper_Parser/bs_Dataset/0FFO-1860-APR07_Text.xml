			The service commenced oas the lst November. 192., andbas contboued sinterruptssly to the present time. givine entire satifacftIon to the ge.eral and local Goveramenrsof New Ee.auad and the colonlata gens- rally. The growilg requirenents and rapidly increasing importance of the ceveral places frequented by the Company-o vessels, and toe timulus Impacted ta commerce by the institution of regular commusunltion basing necssitlated an extension of tIle service, a oupplesnsut-al con. tract was entered into In April last with thea Culnubl Government. roising the subsidy to �-30,OOO per annum, at which rmu It at preccat stands.

			THBE CRIMEA_7V WAR.
			(Continued from T7he imes of Jan. 28.)
			The sitting of Parliament and the important debates which have occupied both Houses compelled us to suspend our review of the official account of the Siege of SebastopoL Availing ourselves of the respite afforded by the Easter recess, we now resume our criticism of this most remarkable work.
			In our last notice we brought the review of the first volume of the Enati.ieers' Journal down to the close of the original letter-press, which was quoted copiously throughout as the sole authority for the statements and deductions of the reviewer. Page after page was carefully collated and examined, because the work comes before the limited public who are likely ever to see it with all the weight of official origin, preparation, sanction, and authority-it relates to a great war as to which there are many controversies, not only on matters of opinion, but on mere matters of fact, still raging fiercely. There are the optimists on one aide, and the pessimists on the other, and, a jus&amp;e miZieu party, who occupy the position of their sect in all things political or religious, and go backwards and forwards. or remain stationary, just as those in front and rear of them pull, drag, or neutralize each other's efforts. The opti- mists declare that the whole thing was perfection from beginning to end, only that two diverse and conflicting powers came in to mar it. These dis- turbing ifiluences were "the System" and "the press." It was "the System" that starved our army, that caused the breakdown of everything- for a breakdown is at last confessed-that took away the beds from the sick and wounded, put on their shoes or hid them, played the deuce with ships, stores, commissaries, purveyors, Quartermaster- Generals, Adjutant-Generals, Generals' orders, quinine, llc.; but which "System" had a great triumph at last-if not over the Russians, with whom we were actually at war, at all events over the Frencb, who were our allies-in getting the whole army into splendid order for fighting (as we are told) precisely when our army had no more fighting to do. It is a melancholy fact, indeed, but the great consolation of our optimists is, not that we were well off the first year, when we were at war, but that the French were badly off the second year, when the place had fallen, and we were all but at peace. Concurrently with offering up sacrifices to their grand fetish - the demon "System"-the optimists, who maintain the eter- nal fitness of things, fling mountains of dirt at the public press, by the action and intercession of which, in truth, the " System," which was destroying so much of the army, was eventually transformed into a beneficent creature, which sent out gargles for sentries, Daffy's elixir for youthful soldiers, and respirators for trench guards. It was "the press" which blew up French mines (we never had any to blow up)-it was "the press " which made it known that the British did not take the Redan (of which our allies would of
			course have said nothing)-finally, it was "the press" which "killed Lord Raglan I" Why not General Estcourt?-why not the French Commis- sioner P-why not Mr. Calvert, tho interpreter, all of whom died at head-quarters within a few days of each other ? Why did not the press kill General Airey, or Lord Cardigan, or Lord Lucan, or Dr. Andrew Smith, or Sir John H[all Did "System" in its beneficent or ma- lific form aid in staying or directing the hand of the mischievous organ I "Who fils the butchers' shops with large blueffies?" "Who - But, no. It is not a subject on which anyone who is aware of the real services rendered by the press-in enlightening and directing public opinion, in giving force and expression tothe feelings of the nation, in exciting the deepest sympathy and admiration for our army, in procuring for it the largest popularity the service ever enjoyed, in awakening the empire to a sense of the hollowness of its securities-it is not a matter, we say, on which any who know what the press has done can affect to jest or be in- different when they hear the ungrateful, hypocritical cant and affected invective, of the men who in their hearts feel that without its aid they had been lost. Thepeoplecametoshore on the life-belt, andtheynow turn round and abuse it because its stringent cords marked a few streaks of black and blue on their delicate ribs. The good sense of the nation has let the small questions drop, and it has pretty well determined in what position the heroes of these con- troversies stand-not their position in office, or in military rank, or in favour, but in history, to which they already belong, though they be yet in the flesh. And perhaps it is not altogether unfortunate for the nation-as it is assuredly most fortunate for the individuals themselves-that they, who were assailed by the voice of the people, and who were charged by the public press with high offences and delinquencie, should have been-as if it were on that account alone-sustained by the most powerful hands in the State. As for the pessimists, who cried out that all was nought, and who saw nothing but incompetency and folly in the whole army, from the drumboy to the General, and madness in the war itself, no one thinks of arguing with them, simply because the splendid actions of our soldiers answer all their assertions.
			We are now dealing with the record of what ac- tually took place in the engineering operations. From those pages nearly every one known to the world in connexion with the siege is excluded or shut up in an appendix. We see as it were the work of the Engineers,which is, however, all above ground, and iu so far is destitute of the exciting and scientific details of mining, tamping, tunnelling, blowing out 6tonnoirs, &amp;c., which generally are found in siege journals, and which form such a large portion of the French history of operations. By the aid of the plans we can accompany the Engineers step by step, and measure off yard by yard. We see them rebuilding merlons of batteries, improving trenches and boyaux, scarping terrepleins, raising epaulements, struggling with their Turks, re- connoitring inthe dark, backed by their hardy intel- ligent sappers. Now and then we are aware that they are in trouble, as on the night of December G, when a trifling omission was made, which is thus stated,-" No sentries ivere posted infronf ti71 8 p.m.
			when the Royal Engineer officer, perceiving the omission, posted them himself !" We find also that when the men do work there is a " great scarcity of miners' tools" (p.209), and that on December 10 " little work was done ;" and why-" the men stated they had now been five consective nights in the trenches." (P. 210.) "Many of the Tnrks and several of the 95th were too sickly to work." (P. 211.) Now and then they work well, and get a whole day's pay, but then there are sure to be no " pickaxes." And we are the first mechanical, tool-making, tax-paying people iu the world! Then our men, half-frozen, took to destroy- ing our own gabions and fascines, in order to make fires, and the losses in this way are daily and duly recerded by the ang,ry Engineers,-who, all the while, are eagerlyceyeing "boatloads of gabions car- ried across from the north side" to the south by the Russians, as well as large quantities of provisions. Anon we hear of odd incidents such as de- serters coming in, or that " a Russian spy, dressed in plain clothes (Jan. 30th), walked through the trenches and batteries. He then suddenly made for the middle ravine, escaped unhurt, and was received with loud cheers by his comrades." (P. 257.) As well, indeed, he might be. And so the Journal closes for the year.
			The first volume consists of 299 pages, 89 of which are devoted to the introduction, the account of the invasion, and the siege of Sebastopol, the rest being filled by an appendix, composed of the trench jour- nals, despatches, memorandums, statistics, and papers on various matters connected with the opera- tions, 54 in all, of which Sir John Burgoyne fur- nishes 21 memoranda, signed by his own name, and probably several others, such as "Instructions forre- newed assault onSebastopol" (148),and "recommend- ing an augmentationof the corps of Royal Engineers in consequence of the experience gained durmg the war in the Crlmea." (P. 152.) Before we proceed to make a fexv remarks on these papers we must say that neither in binding, printing, nor paper is this work worthy of its origin We except from this remark the maps and plans, which are finely exe- cuted. The lithograph in the front is by no means a respectable work of art, though we are not pre- pared to s3y whether the deficiencies lie with the designer or the lithographer; and the typographical errors, misspelling of names, and mistakes of the kind are more numerous than they ought to be in a book which comes out with the sanction of the State. For example, we find the name of a French General, well known then and now, spelt Martimprey, Martemprey, Alartinpr6 (the first being correct). General Trochu is dis.
			figured as General Trocher, General Vinoy is dis-, guised as Vinois, St. Laurent is called Laurent.
			Do Bazancourt is caeled De Beancourt, Mr. Filder is styled Tilder (an obvious misprint); "now" is printed for "not" (page 19S), " night " at- tack is put for "right" attack. The Russian guns are stated to be 109 in page 31, but they are put at 107 in page 132. The 7th Lancers are stated to have been on board the Simla, page 268. We should have thought little of these and other things of the kind did not some of them expose us to the ridicule of the French officers who are likely to see the work, and were it not that the book has been revised by hand, and is in one placo corrected in ink.
			It is observable that at the very outset the French, when they were not so strong as we were, seem to have assumed a leading position, which, so far as we can see, was tacitly acquiesced in; certainly it was submitted to. Thus, when the linen at Bulair were being constructed, long before expedition to the Crimea was thought of, Major Gibb writes- "At the instigation of the French engmeers, on whom apparently was vested the whole responsibility of the trace of the lines, the site originally proposed was altered." (P. 262.) And very curious lines they were. There was a scarcity of water along the posi- tion, so that in summer not more than 3,000 men could have been supplied with that necessaryI But we held on to them, not only after the retreat of the Russians from the Danube, but from the Alma. It was a constant aim of the French to be first in everything. They sailed before we did; they landed before we did. NVe adhered steadily to our pro- gramme and our signals, " to assemble, to form to advance, &amp;c.," as if there was an enemy in sight; but the French, who saw there was no enemy, set to work at once, and threwr their men on the beach so fast that they reported all on shore seoon after noon; they landed 25,000 men and 24 guns before nightfalL Our Generals, seeing the start our allies had got, actually held a little council of war before they would give the signal for the British " to land" without going through the pre- liminary signals (P. 265).
			31uch praise has been bestowed on the landing, and as far as the efforts of the navy and the disci- pline of the men went it was perfect; but it is rather encouraging to us to see that the operation, though undisturbed by the enemy and aided by a most powerful fleet and an incomparable flotilla of transports, was so deranged by a slight breeze of wind as to take full four days to accomplish. Captain Mends, a very competent judge, who ar- ranged the whole plan of the descent, is of opinion, however, that if the fleet had auchored one day sooner, and in the order arranged, the whole of the army would have been landed in 16 hours. It must be recollected, also, that our preparations began long before the actual descent. Mr. Roberts, master in command of the Cyclops, fitted out long Turkish boats peculiar to the Bosphorus, after a plan of his own, by which invaluable assistance was rendered to us. All our anxiety seems to have been centred on landing in the Crimea, as if that would be all the difficulty to be overcome; but on the 23d of July General Tylden, commanding the Engineers, called attention to the deficiency of the Engineers' establishment, and entreated Lord Raglan to get out 160 draught horses from E3ngland, without which he was "convinced of the difficulty, not to say impracticability, of moving stores and materials." The General than knew so little of what was at the time in contemplation that he considers " Varna as the base of operations for the year," but on the 25th of July he is called on to make a report on the requirements for an expedition to the Crimea and the siege of Sebas- t.opoL .ow, be it observed that between the months of April and May, 1854, the attention of the authorities had bean called to the very defective quality of our mining and trenching tools, which we have seen so often alluded to in the trench jour- nals. " The tools were of indifferent quality" (Bays Major Gibb, p. 263); " the spades and shovels were constantlybreaking." Butthe implements foundtobe so inefficient at Bulair in May, 1854, were no doubt sent to Varna, and from Varna to the Crimea. When our troops were short of water at Bulair it was found we could not sink wells deep enough " on account of the weakness of the boring ap- paratus," but had all these tools been the best in the world, "on the landing of the British expedi- tionary army in the Crimea, the Royal Engineers were unprovided with the means of transport for their material" (p. 282). Although they were by far the most comfortably, or the least un- comfortably situate in their internal economy " the want of medical officers permanently attached to the corps was seriously felt" (p. 282). The Sappers and MIiners had their company messes,where their Chobham camp and cooking experiences proved very useful, hot coffee,which the cooks ground up by means of large shot, being always prepared in the morning for the reliefs. They were, per- haps, the most unpopular and hard-worked corps in the army-unpopular, because their duty was to point out to others labour to be done, to fnd fault with its execution, to have the power of censure without the pewer of reward; hard worked, because always requiredand never idle. Of course, the breakdown of "the system" is only incidentally illustrated by the Engineer Journals and Trench- book, but we have seen enough of its working not to be much surprised that on the 5th of February Sir John Burgoyne is suddenly moved to make this remark:-" The result of this campaign in the Crimea manifestly exhibits that the seerera depart- ments of tke army are capable of qreat imp orerment, and their reform will probably hereafter not be so much discouraged as hitherto." These are very preg- naut words ofSirJohnBurgoyne. We wonderwhether theywere ever conveyedhome from the Crimea to the ears of any one in authority, because it is to be pre- sumed that the opinions of an officer selected by Go- vernment as adlatus of Lord Raglan, the Chief of the Engineers, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, were considered of sufficient importance to be duly brought to the notice of the Government. If they were, certainly no action has followed of any decided nature as yet, with the exception of the system of examinations and the institution of the Staff Col- lege. From all we can hear the confusion and stiff- ness of working in the departments are as great, if not greater, than they were at the outset of the first winter in the Crimea. Is it possible "the System" is flourishing once more?

			THE UsE or ToBAcco.-ThE I ian La2wc of the let of February contains an Interesting report on the abolition of tobacco in Indian gaols,by Joseph Ewart,M.D., of Her Majesty's Bengal medical service. It is stated that, one of tho fruits resulting from the appointment of inspoe- tors vested with almost dictatorial powers to watch over and control the general management of InALan prisons, has been the very extensive abolition of the use of narcotics. These had previously been aUowed to the prlsoners under the impression that their use, in some shape or other, wvas essential to the preservation of life in those who had from their youth upwards freely and con- tinuously indulged in them. In the Punjab, Lower Provinces of Bengal, andl Madra it has been wisely rnled that tobacco and opium can only be granted to the convicts at the express direction of the medlcal officer and then only in curtailed quantities and for limited periods in cases where the general health appears to suffer by teir sudden and complete withdrawal from old hbUtuAs. In 1851, outLu of 3S go1s, tobacco was aUowed to the prisoners in
			80 grains; in 18, to 033 grain;ine tdalwo, tont90o gaimns; in two, The authorities who denhounze mtolbnalcncor as a 8 n oxaiou nd poisonous weed are both numerous and of high distinction.
			he results of the experiment, tried on a large scale and under crmcial conditlonsin the Indian prisons,enfficlently show that the fears are groundless which have bhee entertained rgard ing the dangers supposed to follow the absolute and imme- diate withdrawal of tobacco from those persons who have been accnstomed to use it freely from their childhood through al thte middle and later yeanrsof their life. These fear wee eteraind, In the first Instance, by the Bengal Medical Board and the Court of Directors. The Bengal Board reported that, from long andonfirmedhabit, tobaco smoking ad with miany adult convicts become not so much a. luxury as a necessary of lRfe, corpanble to salt and other condiments, which nature prescribe as indicurnable ad- jndts to meals. The Court of Directors considered, also, that discretion was necessary in withdrawing tobaco from persons who had always been in the habit of using It. Three years after the withdrawal of tobacco fromyrisoners In the
			Bngal Presidency had been accomplished D.Mouat pre- sented a report to the Government of Bengal, from which it appeared that, of the 50 civil surgeons imcUo of gaols who had watched the effect of the order, 33 consIdered that the withdrawal of tobacco from the prisoners had not been attended with injury to heath, and 14 gave undecided answers. Wo can allow for the sympathies and prejudices of old amok-era, and we have sue hesitation in concurring in the conclusion of Dr. Mount, that the mass of positive tes- timony accumulated in India as to the absence of any ill- effects from the cessation of the use of tobacco, even in those habituated to it from infancy, fully bears out the opinions entertained regarding it hy many of the most eminent authors of modem times In Europe, and justifies the belief that it is a mere luxury ; thaLt it is not needed for the Performance of any healthy function in the human economy ; and that its denial to criminals in a wise, sound, and judicious measure of prison disslpline.-The Laura.

			LZTURGICAL YIsON.*
			The following remark is extracted by Mr. DaviB from a pamphlet written a few years ago by the preo. sent Bishop of London:-
			"gOf men below the age of 45 throughont the kingdom there may be few, but they are very few-and their number may be counted by units-whose mind is a sort of trauszrpb of the 39 Artclies and the Prayer Book-, who have so habituated themselves from their earliest years to look gpon aU that they find therein written as infallible, that theirthoughts have never ranged beyond the prescribea limits."
			Mr. Davis-not incorrectly, perhaps-detects in this observation, whichis in form only the statement of a fact, a judgment, and that not a complimentary one to the " units ;" and he is accordingly laudably anxious to show that his d, at any rate, is not "a transcript of the 39 Artices and the Prayer Book." He has in this spirit wiitten a very zealous, elaborato, and recondite pamphlet on the subject of Prayer Book reformn, allowing considerable research and industry. He cites authorities copiously, and ex- hibits a command of the pamnphleteering ares, and a famillarity with the nooks and crannies of con- troversy. INevertheless, we are compelled to say that we much doubt the substantial service that Mr
			Davis's production will afford tothe cause of Prayer Book reform. the old proverb pre-emininetly applids to it-" the haflf would have been greater than the whole." The reform w;hich Is really wanted in the construction of our public services is of the simpleo1a
			kind. We want ehorter services, such as would im- poso less strainuponthe attention, and servicesmore simply constructed than the accumulations and com- binations of different services which are now tho only ones in use. But Air. Davis overloads the reform waggon, heaping package upon package upon it till it staggers uader the accumulated weight, and threatens an immediate overturn or a helpless fix in the ruts. At least a dozen fierce and critical theological controversies would have to be begun, carried on. and completed before this
			scasme ot rrayer book retorm was consmruateo4
			Welnowfrom hiBtory the average length of such doc- trinal wars. The first ten pages of Ir. Davis would require about half ai century. There would then bea sixty pages left, which might or might not dig proportionately further into time. The Bap- tiamnl controversy, the Eucharistic controversy' the controversy on the Power of the Keys the controversy about the Apocrypha, would a have .o be repeated; once more would the grand old dispute of the celebration of Saints' days come on the theological iqpi.; once more would tender consciencea prolong with careful interest the di-s cuasion of the casnistical problem of godfatherse and godmethers' promisoe; the Church's calen- dar, the Church's ritual would pass through the most searching ordeal; we sbould live again X the days of Hooler and T. C., second Whitgifts and Abbotts would arise, Hampton Court Conferences would sit again, cassocks and square caps would re- vive in sympathy, grim Puritan visages would reappear in canvas upon our walls, and loodk solemnly down upon oollege dinners. The world iz hardly prepared for the repetition of such doctrinal wars, and the Church, having by meana of various e:;ce]lent eplanations accommodated its formularies as a whole to the consciences of its differing mem- bers, hardly wants them.
			esicleS the unnecessary seriousness of Mlr. Davi5's reforms, which alter the Baptismal, Communion, Confirmation, and Ordination services, the Csta chism, and other importantparts of the Prayer BooE, and alter them doctrinaUy, i. c., in such a rway
			a considerable portion of the Church would not look upon the eervices as containing M;t same doctrine that they do in their present shape- beasides the gratuitously controversial character of his scheme, the minuteness of some of Mr. Dav&amp;fg reconstructions almost provoke a smile. Under tho head of the Church Catechimn he proposes the omision of " and I heartily thank our H:ven Father that He hath called me to this state of ai- vation," under the following circumstances:-
			" As wicked children often repeat the Catechism-such. as juvenile criminals in pri6o0s-the omission .f this clauwe (though intended hypothetically as a guide to ssl.ex-sil- tion)repecting raying 'to oontinue in the samr state of usi- vation untzo their ' lifes end,' would be expedient."
			The formal accommodation and adaptation of the Church Catechism to suit the case of little pickpockets would, doubtless2 be an object worthy of the weighty deberation of Convocation, and the great Synod of the English Church would shine in 'the act of appending to the Catechism, at this part, the following rubric:-" In the instance of juvenile criminals omit." The difficulty, indeed, would not stop here, for there are-sad truth, but it must be confessed-there are " wicked children" who have never been putinto gaol, or even put into the stocks, or taken up by a constable. The excepting rubric, then, must be made larger and more comprehen- sive-including the heinous cases of little boys who have within the preceding six months robbed appletrees, carelessly and wantonly broken panes of glass, disobediently and inexcusably declined learning their lessons, presumptuously and insolently vituperated a fellow-creature who, by ill-luck, got in their way, fallen into a fit of passion, or, worse still, fought. The " omisslon" of this clause of tho Catechism would act in thos
			cases as a tacit sentence of excommunica- tion, by which the severe but salutary justica of the Church would correct the misdemeanours and curb the violences of early youth. Another instance of the minuteness of Mlr. Davis's scheme
			of reform is the substitution he solemnly recom, mends of the word "Hades" for " Hell" In the vernacular translation of the Apostles' Creed whlch is recited in church. Such a substitution would, of course, revive the controversy about the "descent tinto Hell" which vehemently agitated the Reformation age of our Church, and elicited hosts of books and pamphlets; but, to pass over this consequence, does 3Ir. Davis exactly realizs
			tho profound astonishment with which our rurs] congregations would receive the somewhat un- couth and odd-sounding stranger? Has he ever imagined to himself the curiosity rather than reve- rence with whichthisnew andforeign word,in so oldt and familiar a place, would excite ? If he has not we recommendhimtoattemptthis act of the imagination, and also to consider whether the scriptural advice not to pat new wine into old bottles, and new cloth into anold garment, does not apply to creeds. Oar recited creeds are only translations, but they ara translations wrhich have now been consecrated by, use and association, and should not be altered merely for a whim. Mlr. Davis proposes the composition by authority of "a larger catechism," to which suggestion we can only say-Heaven forbid that the attempt shouldbe made ! Our existing little catechism has created dispute enough, but the jealousies and animosities that the construction of a new and "larger cate- chisom" would excite are beyond calculation.

			TRANSFORM ATIOj*
			It may be tempting to make sport of a poet's dream, and the occazion is here ready to our incli- nations. MIr. Hawthorne is a poet, and his Tranw- fornation is a dream, airy and illusory, enticing s to hot pursuit or leaving us to a sense of emptiness and ridicule. What is our proper province in a case like this? WVhat have we to do with ahaiows or ethereal Eemblances? Even art hsas more solid materials for our investigation and opinion. We have, at all events, a shadow or zarefaction here, evoked by a poetical imagination from its contact with known facts. It may be tempting, as we have said, to keep withinthedomain of these facts, and to pour a contemptuous commen- tary on the fancies which have sprung out of them. But it is a temptation which we shall wisely resist in the interests of a higher art than comes ordinarily to thereader'scloset orthe critic's tribunaL Wewillonly state as a preliminary that this is an ideal romance, of which the dust of modern Rome is something more than the background, and In which its hoazy monuments each play their part. The expectants of eatire will understand our abstlnence when we tell them that, among other transcendental processes, the Faun of Praxiteles walks down from its pedestal and becomes the most prominent of the dramatis Persont. On the other hand, those who welcome a work of pure phantasy will appreciate the ideal with reference to which it was moulded. A familiar marble statue is endued with a soul, and this soul is rigorously burdened with moral responsibilities beneath which it tends steadily to grow and develope itself. Strange as it may sound, this conception is not altogether new. The principle of this Roman dream h an echo of other dreams, and the I ITransformation of MIr. Hawthorne, thus freely effected, combines the feat of Pygmalion with the life ordeal of Undine.
			We may wish to pass a balanced judgment on the artistic result, or at least to give the true rat ionale of the process. But when a work of imagination differs from the ordinary standard the task of the critic may be easy or it may'be exceedingly difficult. It is easy to note and condemn certain deviations, which are unequivocal lapses, and the eccentricity, which is both an aberration and a weakness. The singulari- 'des of infirmity are the easiest blots to hit, for, like other blotches and distortions, they simply disfigure a type, and have nothing to commend their harsh departures from nature. But there are case3 in 'which natural types have been asnd may be set aside for airy conceptions to which the world righnt- fully renders homage. Such conceptions belong to a traly ideal sphere, and their congrcaties of grace and proportion sufficiently vindicate their author's audacity. Criticism abdicates part of its functions, and accepts such conceptions as types, models- existences independent and absolute,a It allows a true creative capacity to be a law to itself, nor does it dream of insisting on the anomslies of tricksy Ariels or Pucks or the impossible combination of qualities in an Apoilo B.ivedere.
			The art which attains this high impunity Is so subtle that it defies analysis, and yet so definite in ita manifestation that it admits of no dispute. In a book like this before us we at once admit its pre- sence, perplexing and yet pleasing us, startling and leading us captive. As far as our knowledge of the world's present literature extends Mr. Hawthorne possesses more of this rare capacity than any living writer. His art of expression is equal to the idealism of his conceptions, and his pure flexible Eng- lish beguiles his readers into accepting them as among the sum of probable and natural things. But, none the less, they are pure transcendentalisms, impalpable to common sense and unamenable to iaw, Or rather, as we said, they are a lawv to them- selves, beyond the covenanted rules and formulas of art, and externally in dependent of the critical scheme and dispensation.
			If we conceive we are not entitled to assert our jurisdiction at their exuense, we may nevertheless consider the rationale of their origin. There is a peculiar type of the American mind which is strongly in revolt against American utilities, and which is predisposed by the very monotony of its surroundings to hues of contrast and attitudes of antagonism. WVe have seen the manifestation of this revolt in American literature in Edgar Poe and even in Longfellovr and Washington Irving. It is emphatically the desire of idealists like these and of M1r. Hawthorne to escapo from the " iron rule" of their country and the " social despotism" of their generation. They disdain to be parts of a complicated scheme of pro- gress, which can only result in their arrival at a colder and drearier region than that they were born in, and they refuse to add to "an acca- mulat.ed pile of usefulness, of which the only use will be, to burden their posterity with even heavier thoughts and more inordinate labour than their own." This impulse induces them to become vagrants in imagination and reality, tourists in the old world of Europe, dreamers and artificers in the older world of poetry and romance ; and the con- trast of that to which they attach themselves, as compared with that which they fly from, is more stimulating than early association with such influ- ences is to us. WVe have, in truth, no parallel among ourselves to the freshness of their enthusiasm aud no equivalent to its literary restlessness or &amp;aa.

But the American artist finds himself in Rome with eyes full of innocent wonder, and a heart thumping against his breast like that of Aladdin in the cave. He comes, as he observes, from a country where "there is no Ehadow, no antiquity, no mystery, no picturesque and gloomy wrong, nor anything bat a common- place prosperity, in broad and simple daylight ;"

			Wo can easily conceive that Mr. Hawthorns had no intention at the outset of working such impres- elons into a story or picture of his own constructing. In fact, from the e-tent to which he has introduced descriptions of various Italian objects, antique, pic- torial, and atatuesque, and, from the very miscel- lancous nature of these items, we should rather infer that, in the first instance, he contemplated a work of descriptive criticism. Be this as it may, there is no work, even of this clas, on Rome and its treasures which brings their details so closely and vividly before us. It is worth all the guide-books we ever met with, as regards the gems of Italian art, the characteristic features of Roman edifices, and the atmosphere of Roman life. In fact, we conceive it calculated, in many instances, to impart new views of objects with which travellers may have imagined themselves already too familiar. Thus we Interpret its comments on the statuary by -which Mr. Hawthorne lingers, or the significance he attributes to the open eye of the Pantheon, or his expansion of that St. Peter's, which is, at first sight, a gk7antic casket, intothe true metropolitan temple of the Catholic world. ve obtain a fresh pleasure from our old favourites as their salient points and subtle- ties are presented to us anew thronoh the medlnm of his clear discernment.

Some tia- ditionL even went so far as to enumerate the ears, aovered with a delicate fur, and sbaped like a pointed leaf, among the proofs of autbentic descent which were seen in these favoured individuaIs. at it was indisputable that, once in a century *tpnen. a son of Nlonte Beni gathcre6 into himseli . mral qualities of his race, aun produced the ca.a__ter that had been assigned
			from immemorial times. Strong, kindly, -ncere, with simplo tastes and natural gifts, this personage had a power of associating himself with the wild creatures of the forests and hills, and could feel a sympathy even with tho trees, among which it was his lot to dwell. On the other hand, there were deficiencies both of intellect and heart, and espe- cialy, as it seemed, in the development of tho higher portion of man's nature, and these deficien- cies showed themselves strongly with advancing age, when the animal spirits had subsided, and youthful impulses no longer beautified the original brute nature
			'Around this pedes'Ai, as it were, of his coneeption, Mr. Hawthorme weaves a variety of suggestive legends and Arcadian fillets appropriate to the main figure ; and his dream of a modern Faun in the per- son of Donatello, the last Count of MIonte Beni, actually grows into a portrait by the marvellous skill and consistency with which it is elaborated. At a later period we have a picture of Donatello in his Tuscan home, with accessories such as Horace may have cherished at his Sabine farm, and with the same internal light of a calm rustic felicity. But the description of Donatello in the gardens of the Villa Borghese is a more qnotable specimen of the ingenious art which rusta ns MIr. Hawthorne in his extravagant audacity. The Faun has found his way to Rome, and has attached himself to a young female artist, about whoze antecedents and position there is 3 mystery of criminality. The pair meet 'in the glades of the Roman Eden, of whUch, as an appro- priate background, this is part of the choice descrip. tion:-

Es only garmenta lion's skitu with the elaws upon his shouder-falUs half way down his back, leaving the limbs and entire front of the figure nue.e. The form thus dis- played is marveUously graceful, bub has a feller and more rounded outlino, more flesh, and less of heroic muscle than the old sculptors were wont to assign to their types of mas- culine beauty. The character of thss face corresponds with tho figure; It is most agreeable in outline and feature, but rounded and somewhat voluptuously developed, eoeCdally about the throat and chin; the nose is almost straight, but very slightly curves inward, thereby acquirLng an inde- scrlbable charm of geniality and humour. The month, with its fuU yet delicatoe ps, seems so nearly to smile outright that it calls forth a responsive smile. The whole statue- unlike anything else that ever was wrought in that severe material of marble-conveys the idea of an amiable and sensual creature, easy, mirthful, apt for jollity, yet not incapable of being touched by pathos. It is impossible to gaze long at this stone image without conceiving a kindly sentiment towards it, ssii its substance were warm to the teuch, and imbued with actual life. It comes very close to some of our pleasantest symDathies.
			"Perhaps it is the ver lack of moral Eeverity, of any high and heroic ingredientin the characterof the Faun, that makes it so delightful an objece to the human eye and to the frailty of the human heart. The being here repre- sented is endowed with no principle of virtue, and would be inca1pableof comprehending such; but he would bh true and honest by dint of his simplicity. We should expect from him no sacrifice or effort for an abstract cause; thers is not an atom of martyr's stuff in all that softened marble; but he has a capacity for strong&gt; and warm attashmeat, and might act devotedly tlsrooa7h its imlpulse, and even die for it at need. It is possible, too, taat the Faun might be educated through the medium of his emotions, so that the coarser animal portion of his noature might eventually be thrown into the baekzground, though never utterly ex-
			l"he animal nature, indeed, is a most essential part of the Faun's composition, for the characteristics of the brute creation meet and combine with those of humanity in this strange yet true and natural conception of an- tlnue poetry and art. Praxitele3 has subtly diffused throrghout his work that mute nystery which so hope- lessly perplexes us whenever we attempt to gain an in- tellectual or sympathetic knowledge of the lower oiders of creation. The riddle is indicated, however. only by two definite signs; these are the two ears of the Faun which are leaf.shaped, terminating inlittle peaks, like those of some species of animats. Thounh not so seen in the marble, they are probably to bc considered as clothed in fine downy fur. Iu the coarser representations of this class of mythological creatures there is anot'aer token of brute kin- dred-a certain caudal appendage ; which, If the Fann of Praxiteles must be supposed to possess it at all, is hidden by the lion's skin that forms his garment. The pointed and furry ears, therefore, are the sole indications of his wid, forest nature.
			" Only a sculptor of the finest Imamination, the most dell- cats taste, the sweetest feeling, and the rarest artistic skUil- in a word, a sculptor and a poet too-could have first dreamed of a Faun in this gnise, and then have succeeded in imprisoning the sportive and frisky thing in marble. Neither man nor animal, and yet no monster; but a being in whom both races meet on friendly ground! The idea grows coarse as we handle it, and hardens in our grasp. But it the spectator broods long over the statue, he will be conscious of its spell; all the pleasantness of sylvan life, aU the gental and happy characteristics of creatures that dwell in woods and fields, wiU seem to ba mingled and kneaded into one substance, along with the kindred oualities in the human soul. Trees, grass, flowers, woodland stream- lets, cattle, deer, and unsophisticated man ! The essence of of all these was compressed long ago, and stlU exists within that discoloured marble surface of the Faun of Praxiteles.
			" And, after all, the idea may have been no dream, but rather a poet's reminiscence of a period when man's atfinity with nature was more strict, and his fellowship with every living thing more intimate and dear."
			We conceive Mr. Hawthorne's purpose as shaping itself out of this imprcesion, and as exacting aid from his creative ingenuity in this wise. To embody the Faun for an experiment of the influences of mortal sin and sorrow on its Pagan nature, he trans- ports us to the recesses of the Tuscan hills, where he supposes the existence of a noble race of immemorial antiquity and of hereditary peculiarities. A strange mystery surrounds the origin of this race, who are the Counts of Monte Beni. They bave come down in a broad track through the middle ages, son after sire being distinctly visible in the gloom of the in- terval before chivalry put forth its flower; but they ascend above and beyond this through the Roman Imperial ages, and beyond these, again, into the epoch of kingly rulo, unrtil they reach an origin in the sylvan life of Etruria while Italy was yet guiltless of Rome-a vanishing point at such a vener.hle dis- tance that heralds give up their lineage in despair. Imagination steps in where history falters and assigns them a local habitation and a name in re- treats half Arcadian, amid uplands half reclaimed, when the myrtle and vine were new inrentions, when goat's curds -were a dainty diet, when the rustic mind had not yet risen from its community with nature to the artifices of Fescennine verses and Atellan plays. This race has its heirlooms ia some cavernous tombs, a few bronzes, and some quaintly wrought ornaments of gold, and In gems with mys- tical figures and inscriptions. The very foundations of their old tower were laid so long ago that one- half of its height is said to be sunken under the sur- face, and to hide sibterranean chambers which once were cheerful with the olden sunshine.
			But there is a story or a myth attached to this pre-historic race, and to which Mr. Hawthorne gropes his way, until he finds it in the Golden Age itself. There was a timo, as the trustful Lempribre declarcs, when deities and demigods appeared fami- liarly on earth, mingling with its inhabitants as friend with friend-wben nymphs, satyrs, and the whole train of classic faith or fable hardly took pains to hide themselves iu the primmval woods, and were neither awful nor shocking to the human imaoina- tion. At that dateless epoch, a sylvan creature, nativo among the woods, had loved a mortal maiden and-possibly by kindness and the subtle courtesies
			which love rmight teach to his simplicity, or possibly by a ruder wooing-had won her to his haunts. Thence had sprung a vigorous progcny, that took its place unquestioned among human families, but which In that age and long afterwards showed the lineaments of its wild paternity. It was a pleasant and kindly race of men, but capabla of savage fierce- ness, and never quite restrainable within the limits of social law. Yet, as centuries passed away, the Faun's wild blood had necessarily been attempered with constant intermixtures from the more ordinary streams of human life; while its original vigour kept it from eatinction through the perils and emer- gencies of Roman wars, and its hardihood made it conformable to the exigencies of the feudal ages. Still its hereditary peculiarity, like a supernumerary finger or an anomalous shape of feature, like the Austrian lip, for example, was wont to show itself in the family after a wayward f ashion. At inter- vals growing longer and louger this peculiaritv had

It was as if they had strayed kcroEs the limits of Arcadia, and come under a civil polity where young men might avow their passion with as little restraint as a bird pipes its notes to a similar purpose.

			The association of these two personages is the scaffolding by which Mr. Hawthorne proceeds to the " Transformation" of the Fauu's nature on a theory which seems to pervade his works, that you may Bo change any nature by burdening it with heavy re- sponsibilities. It is represented of 3Iiriam that she has been equivocally involved in some awful catas- trophe, on account of which she is living in retire- ment and isolation. A sort of half-mad priest is the depositary of her secret, and persecutes her incessantlyin spite of warnings and prayers. Dona- tello isawitnessto one of these interviewsonthebrink of the Tarpeian Rock, and at a slgnaiof balf assent from Miriam he murders the priest by throwing him headlong. Thenceforth he and Miriam arc bound together by the consciousness of their common crime, while this consciousness subdues and shatters the nature of Donatello and leads up by degrees to his so-called " Transformation." The last steps of this process are not very happy, nor is their result clear, but the harmony of the conception is sustained even when its outlines are blurred and Donatello is losing his affinity to the wild creatures of the woods. An American artist, a friend of his and of Miriam's, and who seeks him at his home, to which he has retired in a fit of remorse, is the means of thus elicit- ing the fact that his natural virtue has gone out of him. Donatello is invited to try the fascination of his voice in the thicket, and the effect of his mortal defilement is thus exquisitely indicated:-
			" I I doubt,' s3id DonateDo, ' whether tbey will remember my voiee now. It changes, you knwo, as the boy growvs to- vrards manhood.'

Statues gray with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere half hidle and half reveal themselves, high on pedestPls, or pernap3 fallen or broken on the tulf.

			" The final charm is bestowed by the malaria. There is a piercing, thriling, delcious Iindl of regret In the idea of so much beauty thrown away, or only enjoyable at its half. development, In winter and early spring, and never to be dwelt among as the home scenery of any human being. For if you come hither in summer, and stray through these glades in the golden sunset, fever walks arm and arma with you, and death awaits you at the end of the dlm vlsts. Thus, the scene is like Eden in its loveliess ; like Eden, too, in the fatal speUl that removes it beyond the scope of man's actual posseassons. But Donatello felt nothing of this dream-like melancboly that haunts the spot. As h passed among the sunny shadows his spIrit seemed to acquire new elasticicy. The flisker of the sunshine, the sparkle of the
			foutan' gush, the dance of the leaf upon the bough, the woodland fragrance, the greenL freshness, the old sylvan Peace andl freedom, were all intermningled in those long breaths which he drew.

He leapt up to catch the overbanging bough of an flex, and swinging himself by it alighted far onward, as if he had flown thither throngh the air. In a sudden rapture he em- braced tho trunk of a sturdy tree, and seemed to imagine it a creature worthy of affection and capable of a tender re- sponse; he clasped it closely in hiis armn, as a Faun might have clasped the warm, feminine grace of the nymph whom antiqnit.y supposed to dwell within that rough, encircling rind. Then, in order to bring himself closer to the genial earth, with which hig kindred instincts linked him so strongly. he threw htnmself at full length on the turf, and pressed down his lips, kissing the violets and daisies, which k..ted him back again, though shyly, in their maiden fashion.
			"While he lay there it was pleasant to see how the green and blue lizards, who had been basking on some rock, or on a fallen pillar that absorbed the warmth of the snn, scrupled not to scramble over him with their smaU feet ; and how the birds alighted on the nearest twigs and sang their little roundelays unbroken by any chirrnp of alarm ; they reco- nized him, it may be, as something akin to themselves, or else they fancied that he was rooted and grew there; for these wild pets of nature dreaded bin no more in his buoyant life than if a mound of cell and grass and flowers had long since covered his dead body, converting it back to the sympathies frum which human existenca had
			The charm of such a phenomenon to the mind of the woman who encounters him in this familiar garden is thus gradually developed :-
			"Miriam's sadder mood, it might be, bad at first an effect on Donatello's spirits. It checked the joyous ebullition into which they would otherwise have effervesced when he found himself in her society, not, as heretofore, in the old gloom of Rome, but under that bright soft sky and in those Arcadian woods. Ile was silent for awhile; It being, in. deed, seldom Donatello's impulse to express himself copiously in words. His usual inodes of demonstration were by the natural language of gesture, the Instinctive move- ment of his agile frame, and the unconscious play of his features, which, within a limited range of thought and emotion, would speak volumes in a moment.
			"' By-and-by his owvn mood seemed to brighten Miriam's and was reflected back upon himself. He began inevitably, as it were, to dance along the woodpath, flinging himself Into attitudes of strange comic arace. Often, too, he ran a little way in advance of his companion, and then steed to watch her as she approached along the shadowyand sun- fleckered path. With every step she took he expressed his joy at her nearer and nearer presence by wbht might bo thought an extravaganre of gesticulation, but which doubt. less was the language of the natural man, theugh laId aside and forgotten by other men, now that words have been feebly sub3tituted in the place of signs and symbols, IZe gave Miriam the idea of a being net precisely man, nor yet a child, hut in a high and beautiful sense an animal- a creature in a state of development les3 than what mankind has attained, yet the more perfect within Itself for that very deficiency. This idea filled her mobhil imagination with agreeable fautasies, which, after smiling at them herself, she tried to convey to the young
			own pulses, might produce a sound almost identlcel with this; andyet it was as individual as a murmur of the breeze. DonateUo tried it, over and over again, with many breaks at first, and pauses of tncertainty ; then with more confidence, ard a fuller swell, like a wayfarer groping out of obscurity Into the light, and moving with freer footsteps as it brightens around him.
			" Anon, his voice a peared to fli tho air, yet nobt isith nM obtrusive olangour. The sonnd was of a murmurous clLa- racter, sofb, attractive, persuasive, fiiendly. The sculptor fancied that such might hav been the original voice and utterance of the natural man, before the sophisticatlon of the humnm inteleet formed what we now eall language. In this broad dialect-broad as the sympathies of nature-the human brother might have spoken to his inartilnato bro- therhood that prowl the woods, or soar upon the ving, and have been intelligible, to such an extent as to win their con- fSdence.
			"The sound had Its pathos too. At some of it3 simple cadences the tears came quietly into Kenyon's eyes. They welled up slowly from his heart, which was thrilling with an emotion more delightful than he had often felt before bat which he forbore to analyse, lest, if he seizedit,It should at once perish in nis gras
			"- Donat-lo paused two or tre times, ad seemed to listen; then, recommencing, he poured his spirit and life more earnetly into the strain. And, finally-or else the sculptor's hope and imagination deceved him-soft treads were audible upon the faUen leaves. There ws a rustling among the shrubbery; a whirr of wings, moreover, that hovered in the air. It may have been aU an ilusion ; but Kenyon fancied that he could distinguish the stealthy, cat- like movement of somo smal forest citizen, and that he could even sce Its doubtful shadow, if no' rosay its sub- stance. But, all at once, whatever might be the reason, there ensued a hurried rush and scamper of little feet; and then the sculptor heard a wild, sorrowful cry, and through the crevices of the thicket beheld Donatello fling himself on the ground.
			II Emerging from his hiding-place, he Eaw no living thing, saye a brown lzard (it was of the tarantula species) rustling away through the sunshine. To al present appearance, this venomous reptile vwas the only creaturo that had responded to the young Count's efforts to renew his intercounse with the lower orders of nature.
			"' W hat has happened to you' oexclalmed Kenyon, stooping down over his friend, and wondering at the anguish which he betrayed.
			"' Death, death !' sobbed Donatello. ' Theykmow it !
			"Ie grovelled beside the fountain, in a fit of such pas- sionate sobbing and weeping that it seemed as if his heart had broken, and spilt its wild sorrows upon the round. His nnrestralned grlef and childish tears made Kenyon sensible in how small a degree tho customs and restraints of society had really acted upon this young man, in spite of the quietude of his ordinary deportment. In responso to his friend's efforts to console him, he murmured words hardly more articulata than the strange chant which he had so recently been breathing into the air.
			"' 'They know it !' wzas all that Eenyon could yet dis- tinguish. ' They know it 1'
			" 'WVho kn,ow it 7' asked the sculptoz, 'A nd what is it they kinow 2'
			"' They know it !' repeated Donatelao, trembling. ' They shunme. All nature shrinks from me, and shudders at me ! I live in the midst of a curse, that hems me round with a circle of fire! No innocent thing can come near me.'")
			From this point, which is midway ina the second volume, Mr. aawthorne's purpose evidently falters, and there is comparatively a faUling short of the intended rosult. The attentive reader cannot fail to perceive this miscarriage, and we suspect that Yrx. Hawthorne is not only conscious of it himself, but makes Kenyon, the artist, his spokesrman in the difficulty -
			*He pointed to a bust of Donatello. It was not the one
			which Kenyon had begun to model at Monte Beni, but a reminiscence of the Count's face, wronght under the in- fluence of aU the sculptor's knowledge of his history, and of his personal and hereditary character. It stood on a wooden pedestal, not nearly finished, bet with fine white dust and small chips of marble scattered about it, and itself in- crusted aU round with the white, shapelees substance of the block. In the midst appeared the features, lalc sharp. ness, and much resembling a fossi countenance-hut we have already used this simile, in reference to Cleopatra- vith the aocexmulations of long-past ages clinging to it.
			" And yet, strange to say, the face had an expression, and a more recognizable one than Kenyon had succeeded ia putting into the clay model at Monte Beni. The reader Is probably acquainted with Thorwaldsen's threefold analogy -the clay model, the life; the plaster cast, tho death; and the soulptaured marble, the resurrection-and it seemed to be made good by the spirit that was kindling up these ha- perfect features, like a lambent flame.
			"f ' was not quite sure, at frst glance, that I knew the face,' observed Hida; ' the likeness surely is not a striking one. There is a good deal of external resemblance, still, to the features of the Faun of Praxiteles, between whom and Donatello, you know, we once insisted that there was a perrect twin-brotherhood. Bat the expression is now so very different!'
			"'What do you take It to be9' asked tho seulptor.
			"' I hardly know bow to define It,' she answered. ' But it has an effect Ps if I could see this cointenance gradually brightening while I look at it. It gives the impression of a growing intellectual power and moral sense. Donatello's face used to evince little more than a genial, pleasurable ort of vivacity, and capability of enjoyment. *Bat here a soul is being broathed into him; it is the Faun, but advane- leg towards a state of higher development.'
			" ' ulda, do youA see alU this?' exclaimed lKenyon, in con- iderablesurprise. 'I may have had such an ideain my mind, but WAS quite unaware that I had succeeded in con- veyin,g tt into the marble.'
			"' Forgive me,' said Hilda, ' but I question whether this striking effect has beensbroughtabout by any skill or purpose on the sculptor's part. Is it not, perhaps, the chance result of the bust being just so far shaped out in the marble as the process of m'ral growth had advanced In the original? A few more strokes of the chisel might change the whole expression, and so spoil it for what lt Is now worth.'
			I''lbelieveyonare right,' answered Kenyon, thought- fully examining Isis work; 'and, strangely enough, it was the very expression that I tried unsuccessfully to produce in the clay modal. WVell; not another chip shaU be struck From the marble.'
			" And, accordingly, Donatello's best (like that rade, rough mass of the head of Brutes, by Michael Angelo, at Florence) has ever slnce remained in an unfinished state. Meest spectators mistake it for an unsuccessful attempt towards copying the features of the Faun of Praxitdles. One observer Inl a thousand is conscious of something more, and lingers long over this mysterious face, departing from it reluctantly, and with many a glance thrown backward What perplexes him is the riddle that he sees propounded there; the riddle of the sonl's growth, taking its first im- pulse amid remorse and pain, and struggling through the incrustations of the senses. It was the contemplation of this Imperfect portralt of Donatello that originally interested us in his history, and impelled us to elicit from Kenyon what he knew of his friend's adventures."
			Thus, as we infer, ALr Hlawthorne has avowedly left us a vigorous sketch, instead of a finished work of art. His Transformation was too subtle a pro- cess for his skill to perfect in the range of pure mythological existences; or, possibly, he was con- scious of a strain in contrastina such supernatural being with the common every-day life of the Rome around him. At all events, it is a startling effect to be got out of galleries and museums, from the hints and suggestions of classified, catalogued art. Our astonishment is moved by the near ap- proach to a great composition under such con- ditions, and out of such rigid materials. We are more impressed by Mr. Hawthorne's success up to a certain point than by the shortcomings which render this success imperfect; and, like the gazers on the sky in mythologic times, we are surprised that the wings of Icarus should bear him so far, instead of being amazed that they ehould dissolve so sRnon
			There is another female character, introduced as a foil to Miriam, and the happy issue of her intsr- course with Kienyon is obviously designed as a con- trast to the misery of the union which commences in crime. OtherwPise RIilda is not worth much in our eyes, nor, we suspect, in Mr. Hawvthorne's. Nor is there any explanation of the mystery which surrounds Ifiriam herself, which may or may not be considered a fault, at the option of the reader. Minor intricacies we do not remark, and minor blemishes we are indifferent to. Our desire has been to arrive at the central principle of a work of exceptional aim and singular beauty, and to convey this idea definitely to our readers. We find here the nucleus of a clear conception, which is for the most part luminous, though in its outer diffusion it lapses into vapour. So we recognize the power of an artistic Prospero over the cloudy forms and hues of dreamland- while there isso much originality in the shapes into which he attempts to mould them that, thoughi the effect is incomplete, the effort is a work of genius.

			FALSR MARKS AND FALSB MEASURBS.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,- Every honest trader, as well as every honest man out of trade, must concur In the indlignation yoa express in your issue of the 3d inst. against tho scandalous practice of certain traders in issaing goods falsely describod, in falso measures, and with false mars-s of manufactore; and all must be equaly anxious with yourself to aee effective legis- lative provision made for the removal of so foul a blot on the commercia reputation of England as the practlce In question undoubtedly places upon It. And this, as respects the honest trader, quite as much with a view to his own true individual interests as from a patrtotio regard to the na. tional honour, on the maintenance of which our commercial and manufacturing prosperity so mainly depends.
			For my own part, I cannot conceive In what material re- spect sellng goods under false pretences differs from obtain- ing them under false pretences, or why there should not be the same penalties for both, the offences being substantially identlcal, and the consequences of that for which there is at present no legal remedy, or no effective one, being far more general, and, consequently, more prejudicial in its effects than are those of tho other, which is amenable to the crimni- nal law of the country.
			But I think you will agree with me, Sir, that one thing essential to the correction of an offence Is to know and to strike at the real offenders; and that no good purpose what- ever can be served by placing the saddle otherwise than upon the right horse. In these respects allow me to observe that throughout your otherwise admirable denunciation of a most disgraceful system you appear to have been labonr ing under one very great mistake.
			Yon have, over and over again, laid the whole of the blame upon the retailer, to whom, as I believe, no part of It is really attached. You say that shopkeeepers send theiz orders for goods to be made and delivered with so many yards short of the professed measure. You allege that tho purchaser over the counter is systematicaly defrauded " by regular commerclal concerts on a large scale between pro. ducer and retailers." You affirm that " the whole thing is got up at the expense of said purchaser, manufacturer and retailer conspiring together to defraud him of half his measure." You assert that " the cheat is concocted directly for the profit of the retalUer. They pay the manufacturer ashort price for a short measure, but they charge the publia the full price, as ii for a fell measure, and pocket the difference."
			And, yet again, you say "the retailer deliberately orders false measures, in order that he may pay a smaller cost prlce and make a large profit."
			Permit me, Sir, as one having thorough practical know. ledge upon the subject, to assure you that, as against the general body of retailers, all these heinous charges are com- pletely without foundation. In all piece goods, certainly, the retailer is charged the prlce for full measure. it is the retailer, not the parchaser over the counter, who Is the sufferer by this most fraudaulent system.
			A moment's reflection will suffice to satisfy you that ea regards piece goods this must be the fpct. Ho bays his goods by the piece, but ho does not sell them iso. Ho sells by the yard, or by two, threc, sL-, or a dozen yards ; and if be gave false measure the fraud would seon be discovered, his character would become known, and, when known, he might shut up shop as soon as he pleased.
			V-ith very few exceptions indeed, and those only in tha largest way of business, the retailer does not order hls goods from the manufacturer. There can therefore be no such concert between them as that which you have imagined. If he did apply direct to the manufacturer, the manufactnror would not take his order. It is the wholesale dealer who supplies hlm. The wholesale dealer is the middleman be. tween the manufacturer and tho retailer. It is ho and the shipper in the forelgn trade who devlsed the fraud, who continue it, and who profit by It. The retailer, I repeat It, is the main, and generally the only immediate Eufferer from short measure, though the injury must ulti- mately recoil upon the perpetrators of the fraud, or, at all events, upon the general trade of the country as respects our foreien custemers.
			The practice with the manufacturer, tUi within the last 40 years, wvas to caU the yard a measure of 37 inches, inatead of 36, and almost every plece of goods, when it left hLs hands, contained as many 37 Inches as was the number of yards marlked upon it. This wholesome rule was acted upon to secure the retail dealer against loss when cutting one long length into sundry short lengths. I havo no doubt there are many old housekeepers now living who will remember the inducement that was offered in the over- measure which the extra inch upon each yard provided to the purchasing of an entire piece, when othervwise a portilon only would have sufficed.
			Some ten or a dozen years ago-I cannot quoto the date exactly, for I am wrlting without having the papers to refer to-having ascertained that the loss to my own firm from short measure-i. e., measure short of 36 Inches to the yard, in my own establishment, amounted to 3001. in a single year, I endeavoured to get up a general movement of the retai traders against this most pernicious and most dis- honest system. We had meetings here and in London on tho subject, but we received no countenance or assistance from either wholesale dealers or manufacturers with but few, very few, noble exceptions, and the movement, conse- quently, came to nothing. I doubt no' that vre had tho good wishes of many manufacturers ; but aU I Imow for certain is that very few firms indeed, either In the manu- facturing or wholesale line, gave us any more substantial support.
			We requro not only the law to be altered, but to be so altered as to enable the injured party to obtain speedy and cbeap redress. The goods dealt in are controUed greatly In their value by the fashion of the day, and, if any length of time be permitted to elapso before justice can be obtained, the remedy will be &amp;a injurious as the wrong complained of.
			Trusting to your seuse of juslice for the insertion of this protest against a sweeping and most unfounded charge ad- vanced by you-I am sure unwittingly-against a very large body 'of your fellow-countrymen, end wlshing you mast heartily success not merely In your endeavoers to prove that " hcnestv Is tho best policy," but also In your attempts to obtain such an alteration in the laws as sh1ll demcutrat It to bo the only safe one,
			I -s Sir. sour obedient s3.rviant.
			J.I R. JBF1ERY.

			LOffDON, SATURDAY, APRIL 7, 1S60.
			Mr. BRIGHT is never tired of telling us that our Australian Colonies have been allowed to possess themselves of privileges which the people of Eng- land, ridden by priests and aristocrats, are not per- mitted to enjoy. In that new and -wondrous region the rank growth of English Radicalism has by far overshadoNved the domestic plant from the stem of which it was engrafted on the wild undergrowth of the Australian forest. 'We are perpetuaUy warned that we are already in our second childhood, and admonished to profit, while there is yet time, by the political dis- coveries of our precocious ofispring. England is still hesitating as to the adoption of the Ballot. Canada and New Brunswick, notwithstanding the demonstration of its merits which the proximity of the United States has affbrded them, hold unaccountably aloof; but Australia has, without fear or misgiving, plunged into secret voting, and has thus qualified herself to be the admonisher of her venerable parent. It. is in vain that we plead for delay and ask for some account of the effects of this new and questionable inBtitution. Sydney and AIMelbourne have tried it, Sydney and 3Ielbourne are satisfied with the result, and it is perverse ignorance in Old England to require any further information.
			These things have given the politics of Australia an interest in our eyes which they might not otherwise possess. It is an ungracious task to be critical on the first essays of a new country, especially when its institutions are in many respects copied from otur own, and so the faults of Australia might easily have escaped hostile criticism, if indiscreet friends were not perpetu- ally holding up that which fils the wellwishers of our colonies with despair as a model devised for our express imitation. It must, indeed, be in al fairness admitted that in the matter of constitution- makingthe MUother Country dealt very unfairly with ber Colonies. For years she denied them the most ordinary functions of self-government, and then all of a sudden she intrusted them not only with the management of their own affairs, but with the power of making constitutions for themselves. Now, no one can doubt that it is much easier to administer an existing government than to frame a new constitution, and that practice in the management of political affairs is the best train- ing school for constitution-making. These things were, however, entirely neglected in Australia. The result has been constitutions which filled with regret the sincerest friends of these
			nsmg dependencies, and have led by a natural and logical course to the confusion that has followed. In Mlelbourne and in Sydney, Ministry has suc- ceeded Mlinistry with inconc^ivable rapidity, till at last the normal state of things seems to be that the Opposition is stronger than the Govern- ment, and that the first act a ATinister ought to perform on attaining office is to prepare to leave it. A democratic franchise, and a division of electoral districts made -with the most obvious regard to the principle of numbers, have created Assemblies of which we will say nothing worse than that the wealthiest and the best educated colonists are gradually withdrawinr
			from any participation in their proceedings. This is the general effect of the new Australian consti- tutions, and the question is beginning to be seriously agitated whether it will be possible to continue the existing form of government much longer, or whether the Colonies, having adopted the franchise and something like the elec- toral divisions, must not also adopt the institutions of America, and submit to an Executive Govern- ment which holds office on a firmer tenure than
			the confidence of the two H:ouses of the Legisla- ture. We do not forget that -we are invited our- selves to make a great change, and we have a not unnatural curiosity to know how it fares with those who have taken the leap in the dark before us.
			Here, then, is the state of things in the oldest colony of the Australian group-a colony where society is most settled, where capital is most accu- mulated, and which has the full benefit of that form of government which, were the power vested in the present representatives of our present metropolitan constituencies, they would, no doubt, prescribe for this country. Observe that in Sydney a Government has just fallen which was believed to possess considerable strength, but which fell on a division upon an edu- cational question by so large a majority that the discomfited Premier retired into private life, and it was believed that the victorious party remained entirely master of the situation. A leader of the Opposition forms the new Govern- ment, and this is the first bulletin we have of the proceedings of a Mlinistry ushered into office under circumstances so com;nand- ing. " The Government," we are told, "has "hard work to keep its ground.; it is forced "to accept occasional defeats on minor points;
			" it has no compact party, and is kept in "merely to keep somebody else out. The Pre- "mier has a reputation for honesty, which is "beginning to be a rare qualification, but he does "not inspire respect. The Opposition is leader- "less, or rather it has half-a-dozen leaders, all "msnceuvring against each other, and this alone "keeps the Government in. The present Govern- " ment has passed a formal censure on its pre- "decessor, and the SFrxr-rn has resigned, his "health being affected by the long and disorderly "sittings of the Legislature." It is unnecessary to say that there is much in this little sketch which reminds us of what we now are here at home. Wo also suffer from the instability of Government. We also observe that each party retains power by virtue of a number of considerations, among which its own merits or those of its leader very often rank for extremely little. We are often told that the reason wny the pyramid of power is so unsteady is that it is standing on its head, that we intrust to the few the power over the many, and then wonder that this power is uncertain in its tenure, and liable to violent and continual fluctuations. The Australians, at any rate, have fallen into no such error, and yet we see that these fluctuations are infinitely more violent among them than among us.
			It must be remembered also that the Colonies are trying this great experiment under much more favourable circumstances than the Mother State. They have none of those institutions which by an appearance of inequality excite democratic passions, and induce mankind to curtail their liberties in order that they may gratify their envy. Australia has no Established Church to overthrow, no privileged order of nobility to chafe against, no superiority of mere rank to murmur at. A career is as fuliy open to talent there as ever it was in the army of the First NAroLEox. In Australia the suffrage, at any rate, is not principally in the hands of persons living on wages; while the vast waste lands afford a valuable Conservative influence, and give each elector an interest in a settled and per- manent order of things. In England all these things are different. 'We have all the provocatives which are absent in Australia; we have none of the safeguards she possesses. WVhen we vest in a totally new class supreme political power it may be well to consider how we are to keep that class in harmony with the existing order of things, or how we are to provide against the case of a belief arising that the interests of the masses and the existing order of things are irrecon- cilable with each other. For this purpose it is of no avail to cite to us the very imperfect and partial success of the constitutions of America and Australia. 'What we want to see, but also what no one has as yet shown us, is a govermuent con- ducted by an Assembly possessing the supreme power in the State, and elected principally by the working-classes, in an old and fully peopled country, in a highly developed state of society, where the working classes have been found willing to tolerate any species of political or social dis- tinction, and where they have not insisted on re- ducing everything to their own level and standard. 'We are seeking to mend an old garment with new cloth; is it not worth while inquiring how far the worn and frayed material is strong enough to bear the operation?

			If any one would engage the close attention of an audience in this age, let him speak to them of revenue and expenditure. There is nothing that so thoroughly interests us as the g,reat national ledger. Ask any assembly which is, up to this time, the great speech of the Session. They will reply, with the unanimity of a HAnfrLTONaAN class,-" xr. GLADsToN&amp;'s speech on the Budget." The only failure about it was an eloquent peroration, which, coming after he had told all his secrets, was hardly heard amid the buzz. But for four hours did that expert tactician dril his Arabic numerals, deploying them into lines and forming them into columns, and charging with them into every man's household; and we were never weary of admiring his dexterity, and marking howv- well he manouuvred them. He quartered all those figures upon us, to our infinite discomfort, and we went about throw- ing up our caps for him. He was so certain of his ground that he even laughed in our faces, and gently twitted us for our ignorant patience, and we laughed with him at our own expense. There is no one who has skinned us so unmercifully as Air. GLADnToxn, but we are so used to the process that the sensation is not much worse than ticl;ing; and we admire the delicacy of touch and the sharpness of the blade, even while we twist, and wriggle, and surrender our skins. It is the same with us Anglo-Saxons all the world over. When lIr. GLADsro_E stood up in the West to tell every one how much of his property he was about to take from him, all the
			population ran together to cheer him. Far a-way in the hot East 3Ir. Wuso.N comes forward, with his handkerchief to his brow, to do precisely the same work under stiUl more difficult circumstances_ for his eels had never before been skinned, and ha could not boast of either delicacy of touch or sharp- ness of blade; but straightway aU India begins to dance and sing around him, as if OnrnEus himself had come to tax them to so fine a tune.
			There is somewhere in Calcutta a delibarative assembly called the Legislative Council of India. It sits with open doors, or, for aught we know, with no doors at aU; for in those hot regions they shu out nothing but the sun. The public is freely admcitted to the debates that there have languid being, but we never yet heard of any one who had voluntarily sought admission in the character of audience, and the reports that reach the public through the Indian newspapers are of the most brief and spasmodic nature. Yet here, even in this obscure and neglected forum, a man of no oratorical reputation, and whose only fame is that he is believed to be full of that un- inviting lore which is to be acquired from AD.SM SrwiH and RICAoDo, and MI%Iu and A'CuLLocir, and such-like much-talked-of but sparsely-read authorities, rises and talks through several steamy hours; and no sooner does he sit down than his words are reuroduced in four-and-twenty closely-
			printed columns by the Indian press. Every civil servant, from the highest covenanted servant to the last arrived competition-vwallah, every military an32n, from the Commander-in-Chief to the soldier on his way to the Barrackpore Bazaar, every European adventurer, from the leading unplaced barrister in the Supreme Court to the clerk an a railway, or a coal pit, or an indigo plan- tation, sits down and reads these twenty-four pages light through. He gets up with the acquired knowledge that his brandy pawnee, and his bltter beer, and his Manila cheroots,-every- thing that he eats, drinks, and puts on, from `1s champagne to his pajamas, are all increased 'In price; and that, in addition, he wViU have to hand over to the tax-gatherer 41. out of every 100O. of the salary he receives or the gains he pock-ets. Yet, although he reads all this, 3trange to say, he reads it with unqualified plea- aure. Every matl compares the certainty before him with the vague apprehensions that had been haunting him. The civil servant enters upon bis memory in letters of light that comforting sentence, " I am bound to say that we do not see "much ground for expecting any reduction of Cexpenditure with respect to the civil adminis- " tration of India. We rather incline to think "' that it is more likely to be increased." The hunted civil servant would be found out by the Income-tax collector even in Baker-street; it is better to meet him like a man, with full salary and in his own cutcherry. The military magnate is not altogether so well quieted in his mind, for the orator has postponed the ftlll discussion of his case; bht even to him he has thrown in these comforting words, " It will be in vain to expect CC great reduction in our army finances." The adventurer is also satisfied, for he is generally of a Zare-all and spend-all turn of genius. His parti- cular pleasure is that the new system is to be uni- versaL For the first time, the " Heaven-born," as he delights to call the covenanted civil servants, are to be catalogued in the same columns as the European interlopers. There is to be no delf and no porcelain in this new Wamso02N pottery. Every -nug is to stand for what it will hold and for what lt wEi give forth. In fear or in hope, in pride or in triumph, every European thinks he has some cause to love this new system, and every Anglo- Indian thinks Mr. WIaoSN a most interesting -orator.
			What, however, sha]l we say for the natives who are now, for the first time, about to be brought to book? Native wealth has floweed into Ahe towns to hide itself from the tax-gatherer, who found it out so easily in the paddy-fields, and +the poppy patches, and the indigo plantations. This speech is a declaration that the tax-atherer has at last followed it out to its lurking-places. Trade, that sensitive,feminine thing,which requires so much protection from force, but which shrinks from all coercion, has hitherto been policed gratis. MIr. WilsoN comes tungallantly to tell this dark-skinned dansel that she must now ransom herself with an earring or an anklet, and must contribute some- thing to the maintenance of the guards who pro- tect her. Mlr. WVisoN has an argument ad homi- szems for the Hindoo. He brings down upon him his own sacred books; he shows him that, accord- ing to the laws of MsE-u, the King is entitled to a 20 per cent. income-tax and a sixth of all ,annual produce, 2 per cent. upon aU annual savings, and the half of al mines. This is a very commandling position whence to call a parley with a discontented Hindoo. When our financier ask-s the artisan or petty trader to pay a licence of one, four, or ten rupees, he shows him that it is a very small dividend upon his actual obligations. If the mindoo trader does not know what taxation zaeans, it is because we have suffered the fact to ifade out of his memory; he had an excellent gnotion of it under his native rulers, or we should never have found so much plunder at Scringapatam and other places. Of course, he will put all his wits to work to evade these payments, and there will be a constant warfare between the tax-gatherer and the ;mild Hindoo; but, when the system is once esta- ;lblished, the money wil comne.
			We do not claim the population of India, espe- ciafly the zemindars and baboos, to be among the admirers of Mr. Wirsox's elaborate financial speech ; but to al classes this exposition has Ibeen a relief from an uncomfortable suspense. Mr. WilsoN has told them in exact figures what they knew vaguely long ago. That annual deficit of five and a-half millions, that old arrear of seventy-two millions, that current deficit of nine miulions, that prospective deficit of six and a-half millions, the recent crisis in the money-market, and the threats and uncertainties that lie darlk in the future-all these things were known ; and, -.lthough every one shut his eyes, every one knew that a blow was coming. Well, here it is
			it is sharp and stinging, and it makes them wince and shrug their shoulders, but it is not a blow with a mallet which stuns them, or 1inocks their brains out. To be sure, it is not quite certain that they may not yet have to endure another stripe or two. Wl'hen Mr. WrnsoN tells as that he cannot say how much his taxes will pro- duce, but probably not enough to serve the purpose .vithout great reductions, and in the same speech that he does not see his way to any great reduc- tions, he slightly diminishes the comfort with which his victims resign themselves to his opera- tions. But suppose it should be necessary to add another one per cent. Nature abhors a vacuum, and the Anglo-Saxon abhors it in Wis exchequer as much as Nature herself. He will pay his 5 per cent. as he wiU pay his 4 per cent., now that he has been tanght to take upon aimself his proper responsibilities. The same
			lhing is happening in India as happened in England when PE:EL came in and stopped the backward sliding of the financial car; propping it first, and then giving it a constant forward impetuls by at- taching to it a working locomotive in the shape of an Income-tax. It was painful, but it was borme in England, and so it is now
			ln India. That Peninsula exhibits the strange spectacle of a cotuntry which is in a paroxysm of 3oy at a tremendous impost of taxation; and Mr. 9fILSON has succeeded in disproving the aphorism of BuaiE, which he himself quotes, that "it is 4' as difficult to tax and to please as it is to love G' and to be wise."

			i Wihat a trial it must be to those who sigh for the ages of faith to think that at this moment the Xoudest thunders of Rome are resounding harmlessly through the air! lever did the PorE's ostensible dominion comprise so many and sUch widely ex- tended regions. It is the boast of Catholic zeal to have kept pace with the tides of conquest and emigration, to have placed a priest wherever a miner drives his pick into the VoiI, to have rtun up a church among every ssemblage of log huts in the wildermess, and while thus growing with the growth of new nations not lo have neglected the stationary races of the Old World. Far into the recesses of Tartary, slong the rivers of China, aud amid the diverse races of India and the Eastern Seas, the Catholics boast of their energy and their tuccesses. Tho waaUs of St. Peter's record the mames of Bishops from overy part of the known *vorld as present at the promulgation of the doe- lrine of the Immaculate Conception a few years since. What was the region which obeyed iIsocENT III. to the mighty field open to pis successor of the present day? A few half- civilized States of W'estern Europe, threatened
			with destruction by Turks and Saracens, and I without influence on the Greeks and Pagans of their Eastern frontier, was the world over which medimval Popes raised their spiritual thrones. Prls IS now sends his encyclical letters to the faithful of Australia or Natal, and he appoints Bishops to Sees from which the tide of MIussul- man invasion s-wept their predecessors more than a thousand years ago. Catholics boast of all this, and can hardly be made to feel that their pride is groundless and that their hopes are fallacious. What is an absolute progress has been a relative retrogression. Catholicism has extended to distant regions, but rather as a gleaner where a newer and healthier civilization has sown the seed and is about to reap the harvest. In outward appearance the Church is the same, and it can, by the help of a few emissaries, establish itself in the colonies and conquests of Protestant nations, give its Bishops titles from the cities which heretics have founded, and with but a handful of votaries affect the airs of universal sovereignty. Yet, in spite of al !these efforts and display, it cannot be concealed that the world which has been planted by emigration will grow up outside the Roman pale,, which will comprise only the South of Europe anu the decaying Colonies of Spain. Similar has been the result on the con- tinent of Europe. Immense exertions and a zeal worthy of a better cause have been aided by the terrors which Democracy and Socialism inspire to drive rulers and nations back into affected venera- tion for Rome. To the skill of the priesthood, which has enchained Austria and preserves an armed peace with the Emperor of the FRENcH, we must pay a tribute of admiration ; nor can we help acknowledging that the PoPp is well served, and can cause trouble to the most powerful Governrents. But what comes of all this zeal, this morbid activity, this discipline, this secret ramification, this intriguing and mischief-making ? Is the Church of Rome realy powerful over men's minds at all in proportion with the exertions of the priesthood ? Has it gained by the stifling of every free impulse among its disciples, and does the affection of those it attracts counterbalance the apathy or hostility of those whom it alienates? It seems not. Events show that this great spiritual monarchy, with aU its elaborate machinery, can effect nothing where it is opposed by courage and a good cause. That gouty BnsrAxus, that pur- blind ARGUS, the Papacy, cannot take vengeance on any foe more powerful than the unarmed inha- bitants of an Italian town.
			No acknowledgment of weakness can be more complete than the Excommunication which the public may have read in our columns yesterday. We really do not know how to speak of it, since the expressions which suggest themselves in re- ference to such documents are so utterly inapplicable on the present occasion. The " thunders of the "Vatican" ought to be " hurled"-the " ana ethema of the Church" should be " launched," at the head of an offender. The maundering lueu- bration which some Italian or Irish priest has writ- ten for poor Pope Pius is more like a bad squib than a thunderbolt. Nothing can be more pitiable than the spectacle of a Sovereign Pontiff, after months of boasting and menace-after inciting a priestly clique to agitate for him in every State in Europe-after having done all in his power to bring a foreign army again into his own country-thus pasting an un- meaning remonstrance on the church doors of Rome. King VicxTox Exxmr LEx, the arch-enemy of the Holy See, in this case is not named, but merely hinted at in obscure phraseology, and a general, and therefore harmless, malediction is uttered against all who took part, directly or in- directly, in the severance of the Romagna from the Papal States. As this anathema will certainly affect about twelve millions of people, no indi- vidual need look upon the thunderbolt as directed chiefly at himself. Each one will regard it with indifference, and the Papacy will have the satis- faction of showing to the wvorld that its bad government and anti-national impulses have not been inspired even by the questionable virtue of courage.
			The theory developed in the text of the com- munication is, as far as we can understand it, as follows :-That it was ordained by GOD that, at the fall of the Roman Empire, the universal temporal power being destroyed, and a number of independent Sovereignties founded on the ruins of it, the Papacy should be endowed with a temporal dominion, in order to give it that unity and con- sistency necessary for the government of the Church. The dominion of the Popes, although having the appearance of something temporal, is really spiritual, on account of the spiritual object to which it is destined. WVhoever, then, attempts to interfere with the dominion of the POPE commits sacrilege by laying his hands on that which was founded for the benefit of the Church, and which partakes of the Church's holiness. There is one sufficient answer to this theory, and it is that which the inhabitants of the RI- magna have given, and which the rest of the Roman people seem inclined to echo. The PoPE's revolted subjects have proclaimed that they differ in no respect from the rest of the world, and are determined not to abandon those rights to which they are entitled in common with the rest of the human race. That government should be for the good of the governed, and that whenever rulers wvilfully and persistently postpone the good of their subjects either to the interests of foreign States or to abstract theories of religion or politics, the people have a right to throw off the yoke, are principles which have been too often admitted and acted upon to be any longer questioned. Pius IX., surrounded by a knot of priests, gathered from all quarters of the earth, and accustomed to regard the interests of their caste as alone of import- ance, may forget that the men, women, and children subjected to his sway are flesh and blood like the rest of Europeans, that they are brought into contact with Piedmontese, and Frenchmen, and Englishmen, that they read books
			and newspapers, that they have domestic and social and commercial interests of their own, and form opinions on every subject which comes to their notice ; he may think only of the tra- ditions of the Vatican, and treat his States as an appanage of his spiritual dominion; but there are two parties to a contract, and before he can plead his rights to Europe he must show that they have been acknowledged by the people whose interests are chiefly affected. When have the Italians accepted the position of serfs on the gleoe land of CHxisT's Vicar ? When have they given up themselves and their chil- dren to sacerdotal domination in order that the ecclesiastical machinery of Mexico or Ire- land may work satisfactorily ? It is plain from the complaints of the Hoay FATHER himself that his subjects have wholly refused to advance the spiritual interests of foreign nations by their own misery. "It might have been expected," says His Houriss, " that the originators of these violations " would, in consequence of our repeated ad- " monitions, abstain from these unjust projects, " especially as all the chiefs of our holy Church, "as well as the faithful believers of every rank, "dignity, and class, joined their own protests to " ours, in order to defend the rights of the Holy "See, as they very well understood how much the "temporal power is necessary for the mainte- nmince of the Papal power." " But we shudder "in saying' they did no such thing. The people
			of the Roman States, aided by the only constitu- tional kingdom in Italy, and by the other pro- vinces which hai expelled their rulers, all refused to recognize the ecclesiastical doctrine by which a large section of the Italian people was to be sacrificed for the good of the Catholic world. It is this universal rejection of the Papal claims which has unnerved the advisers of the Roman Court. They cannot excommunicate by name the Prince who has been the leader of the whole nation, and they are consequently obliged to be content with this weak and ridiculous remon- strance.

			LATEST INTELLIGENCE.
			The following text of the protest of the Duchess of Parma has been received at MIr. Reuter's office:-
			We, Louisa Maria of Bourbon, Regent of the States of Parma, in the name of Dlake Robert I.:-
			" In presence of the facts which have just been aecom. plished in the States of Duke Robert L, our well beloved son, and In particular in presence of the pretended popular wishes issued illegally on the 11th and 12th of March inst.; and of the usurpation of the same State consummated by their annexation to a neighbouring State:
			" We consider it a sacred duty to again raise our solemn protestations.
			" We protest at first against the pretended right of d4dition proclaimed in favour of the peoples; a new encou- ragement brought forward to withdraw them from obedi' ence to the constituted Governments.
			"Against the proceedings taken by the Government of His Majesty the King of Sardinia to obtain at any price the manifestations of the populations of the Duchy In his own favour.
			" Against the violence imposed upon the Parmesan peoples by the agents of the Piedmontese Government. We 'knowv of old the true sentiments of the inhabitants of the Duchy. We have had numerous proofs of them in memo. rable occurrences during our Regency, and even at a more recent period. The sentiments are those of attachment to the autonomy of their country, of fidelity to their legitimate Sovereign. It is under the intimidation of threats, under the corruption of intrigue, under the pressure of terror, it Is after the oaths to the King Victor Emmanuel which have been imposed under the penalty of destitntion to the employ,s of all the branches of the Ad- ministration; it is in consequence of the general discourage- ment produced by nine months of uncertainty, sldlfully maintained, and of terrible dangers; it is by such means that the manifestations of a suffrage falsified beforehand were extorted from a considerable number of individuals. These manifestations, planned abroad, contrary to the permanent interests of the populations, as well as to the rights of the sovereignty and to the independence of the State, cannot have the least moral value, and we therefore declare them to bo void and of no effect.
			" We further protest-
			"Against the annexation of the States of our well-beloved son to the dominions of the House of Savoy-an annexation accepted and consummated; and therofore we protest no less
			" Against the acts of acceptation and the taking posses- sion of the said States than against whosoever has contri- bated, by his counsels or his aid, to encourage it or to eflect it.
			" This annexation is a flagrant violation of European treaties, of all the principles of international right, and of the inviolability of States and of Crowns.
			" This annexation could not be claimed as a legitimate consequence of the war, and we intend to repel always, and above all, the false reasoning put forth by the Piedmontese Government, notwithstanding the sense of the purely de- fensive treaties between the Duchy of Parma and Austria, in misconstruing the facts, in order to bring the Duchy to the condition of a belligerent Power in the conflict which had arisen between Austria on the one side and France and Piedmont on the other, and thus to procure for itself an apparent title to make It an object of conquest.
			" The whole world knows perfectly that from the mo- ment when Nvar was declared the only object of our irre- vocable conduct and our persevering efforts was to protect the independence and the well-being of our peoples, while observing an attitude of neutrality.
			" This neutrality, such as was permitted to us by the treatles, but nevertheless true and legitimate, was violated by the entry of the foreign troops at Pontremoli. We pro- tested at that time, and we did not leave our States until our protests no more sufficed to protect the sacred rights of our son.
			" Our neutrality rested upon solid reasons of right and of fact, which have served to cause the rights of the Delce of Parma to be recognized and reserved in the Treaty of Zurich. It is, nevertheless, always superior to the con. ditions and to the vicissitudes of that treaty. Founded upon international right, it is imperishable.
			" The right of the Duke Robert to the States of Parma Is ancient, acknowledged, confirmed, and entire. It has been guaranteed by the European Powers in the treaties of 1815 and of the 10th of June, 1817 ; it has received an implcit confirmation of the Ring of Sardinia by the international treaties concluded since that epoch, and especially by the treaty of peace stipulated between Austria and Pied- mont the 6th of August, 1849, to which, by Article 5, the Duke of Parma was invited to adhere, which he did. This right, according to the principles recognized and supported up to the present in Europe, cannot be replaced by a pre- tended right of popular suffrage, stlll less by the unlimited right which would have peoples give themselves to a foreign Sovereign.
			" Therefore, the offer of the States of Parmn, which the Piedmontese Government has procured for the Ring of Sar- dinia by revolutionary means, their acceptation and their consummated annexation by the decree of the Ring Victor Emmanuel of the 18th of March, 1860, are acts of a guilty and odious epoliation to the detriment of our beloved son Duke Robert I. and of his successors.
			" Mother, Guardian, and Regent,
			" We protest anew, in the interest of our aynasty and of the people's of the States of Parma, against all the unjust acts which we have just noticed, as well as against their consequences.
			" And, vithout waiting an examinatlon, to which the Powers of Euirope could submit (even by Article 19 of the Treaty of Zurich) the new order of things created in Italy, we appeal to the said Powers. We claim their support, and we trust vith conaidenco to their equity as well as to the justice of God.
			" The present protest wil be notified to all the Power, who signed the treaties of 1815 and 1817, and to the other frlendly Courts. "LOUISA.
			" Zurich, March 28, 1860."

			THE CRYbSTAL PALAOc.
			Good Friday, whenever the weather admits of it, is one of London's great days out, and yesterday, the firbt spring day which has yet broken the monotony of one of onr longest winters, gave ample scope for holyday-maklng. Excursion trains took people to aU sorts of conceivable places, apparently only for the purpose of bringlng them back again immediately; boats and busses plied buslly to all the suburban rendezvous so much affected in the summer season; and the great mass of Londoni's hard-worked population, to whom a few hours' rest and holyday is a source of unalloyed delight, made merry, and en- joyed themselves by thousands. If there is one lesson more forcibly taught than another by the eager avldity with which people in the humbler ranks of life look forward to a fine Good Friday as a holyday, it is certainly
			that these anniversarles of rest and recreation are much too few and far between. Even the stern Puritan saw the ne- cessity of conniving at some means of relaxation for the masses, and the same edict which swept saints' days from the calendar established that the first Tuesday in every month should be a holyday. These Tuesdays now, alas I are as much out of date as the Puritans themselves; there Is no established annlversary in the snumner which can be claimed as a universal holyday for all classes, so the people have only to set apart as many fine Sundays as they can get for pleasure-seeling, or cele- brate with out-door rejoicing such a day as yesterday, which elsewhere, almost throughout the world, is a day of solemnity and mourning. The fable of the always strung bow is as true as it is old, and there wonld be less need of theatrical and other extraordinary devices to get people to listen to sermons if the public generaly did not feel that Sunday was almost their only chance of recreation and amusement. Why should not the Queen's birthday be made as general a holyday for all as it now Is for banks and Government establishments? No boon would beso grate- fully recelved, no anniversary could be found more fit for universal celebration and festivity. But, as we have said, yesterday, as usual under the present nfl-work system, was treated as the great holyday of the year, and nowhere was it celebrated with more eciet than at the CrystalPalace. To those who in the great crowd at the London-bridge satlon under- went a crushing process of filtration through many barriers before they reached the train, the " day out " must have had its drawbacks. Everybody was of course in tho highest good-humour, and bore the squeezing with fortitude, but, even under the best Circumstances, struggling in a crowd at last becomes'monotonous, as, indeed, many seemed to think; though, once entangled in the stream, there was nothing for it but to go on. As fast as the trains could draw up and start, they were sent away loaded with hun. dreds, and, though this process went on for hours, It seemed to effect but slight reduction in the crowds which kept con- stantly pouring in. We are not aware of the numbers that went down by train, butthey must havebeen something enor- mous ; and it is only fair to the railway authorities to state that their arrangements were as good as they could be under the circumstances. In spite of this influx by rail, all the roads to the palace were ae much crowded as we have ever seen them on any occasion. Busses from the most dis- tant quarters were pressed into the service, and half the cabs, spring carts, and excursion vans of London seemed to be congregated round Norwood.
			At 3 o'clock there could not have been much less than 40,000 people in tho grounds and building. The Handel orchestra and al the gaUerles round the great transept were thronged with dense masses, the fine arts courts were crowded, the grounds overrunwith impromptupic-nicparties. As lately usual on these public occasions, the Volunteers mustered in considerable numbers, and the universal taste for " uniform or fancy dress " manifested itself in some startling varieties of the Highland costume.
			Piccolomini's singing and the performances of the Clrystal Palace and Guards bands were listened to with rapt atten- tion, and the effect of some of the pieces, in which the audience joined, such as the " Hundredth Psalm" and " God Save the Queen," gave at least a fair idea of the numerical strength of the chorus, whatever might be the opinion it left as to its musical capabilities. As faithful chroniclers, however, we are bound to say that the refreshment counters were the great centres of attraction, and high art stood no chance when brought Into competition with Allsopp's ale and ham-sandwiches. Next to theso, however, the picture gallery and tropical depart- ments seemed most popular. The cases which contain the beautiful objects to be distributed this year in the Crystal Palace Art Union-the best works of Elkington, Minton, Copeland, and Kerr and Binns-were also very deservedly objectsof continued admiration. Itmusthavebeen near mild- night before the last of the vlsitors were fairly back in town, anamountofdelaywhich it isonly fair to state thepuablc use -theirverybestendeavoursto effect. UntUthe publiclearn that very simple truth that two bodies cannot occupy the same space at once, and that a passage only wideenough to accom- modate two wiU not hold six without considerable incon- venience, there will always be crowding and confusion in getting away from the building. Visitors forget that they can come Into the palace as they please, but that they cannot leave It aU at once, at least by rail, and that the greater the crowd the less chance there is of getting away at al. The facilities for leaving, however, are not as great as they might be. If there were two departure stations-an arrangement that could easily be made-the expenso of forming the second would, we shonld think, be more than repaid in the first year by the increase in the number of visitors which such extra cDnveniences would be sure to attract.
			The programme for tho present season at Norwood has just been decided on, and, as the summer arrangements here are always lookod forward, to with considerable interest, no apology will be needed for at once laying before our readers an outline of the chlef attractions promised. Tho directors state that the modification adopted last year in the guinea- season tielcets by which the holders were admitted on payment of half-a-crown whenever the price of admission fixed for the day was 5s., appears to havegiven general satisfaction. They have, therefore, determined on repeating It. with the ad- ditional advantage that these tickets wil not be excluded on any day in the coming season, as they were on the occasion of the Handel Commenioration. The new season will open on the 2d of May with a great festival for the inauguration of the colossal bronze statue of Mendelssohn, by Mr. Charles Bacon. This statue Is the result of a subscription by the friends and admirers of the composer, headed by Hfer Majesty and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort. The principal feature of the festival will consist of a grand rerformance of the oratorlo of Elijak. The musical arrangeoments have been undertaken by the Sacred Hear. monic Society; the band and chorus will consist of nearly 3,OO performers, and Mr. Costa acts as conduotor. The statue wiUl be placed for the occasion in a prominent position on the terrace. It is proposed that the ceremony of unveiling it shall take place at 6 o'clock, and be followed at dusk by a great torchlight procession, similar to that at the Schiller Festival last autumn.
			On the 26th of May will ba the first grand show of fruit and flowers of aU kinds, and this, we are sorry to say, wlll be the only one of this Idnd, as the other shows, which take place in June, August, and November, are limited respectively to roses, hollyhocks, and chrysanthemums. At present six afternoon concerts are fixed to take place fortnightly, as usual, from May to July, and arrangements, It Is stated, are in progress for other entertainments of the same klnd. There will also bs performances bythe children and members of the Tonic Sol-fa Association, numbering 5,000, orL the 1th of May; by the Metropolitan Schools Choral Society, on the 16th of June ; and by the Metro. politan Charity Children, early in the same month. This latter performance vwill be invested with an addi- tional interest from the clrcumstanco of its having been de- termined by the society of patrons that the anniversary meeting, hitherto held in St. Paul's Cathedral, shall be sus- pended this year on account of the alterations recently made and still in progress in that edifice.
			An arrangement has also been made for a grand musicalfes- tival by the SorVidt des Orphemistes, of France, an extensive association for the promotion of vocal parb music which has its headquarters at Paris, bat the branch societies of which extend through almost every town and village in France. Upwards of 160 choral assoclations belonging to 40 depart- ments of France wil be at the palace on the three days of this festival. We presume the newly annexed department-Savoy-hitherto so fraitful in wandering minstrels, wil be wel represented on this interestlng occasion. In addition to this there is to be " a brass band contest,"-an archery meeting, the usual open- air amusements, such as cricket, boats, rifle practice, poultry and bird shows, and of course the display of the great foun. tains at certain periods. The refreshment department has been increased by a most important and long-desired addl- tion-that of a number of private dining rooms at the end of the south wing, near the railway corridor. These rooms, which of course are lofty, and wil be beantifully fitted, overlook the whole of the gar- dens and the mannificent landscape beyond, and are intended to accommodate private parties of from o of 6 to 30 or 40. The library and reading-room has been en- larged and moved to a better place in the building, and in connexion with this the directors are about to establish a school of art, science, and literature for the instruction of classesby eminent professors. The decided success which at- tended the ArtUnion of Lasiseasonhasencouragedthe council to extend its operation stiM farther, and with this viewthey have resolved on spending 2,0001. in anticipation of the amount available for prizes tothe subscribers. Thus, not only have important additions been made to the prizes, but the list of presentation works, to wbich eli sbscribers are
			eniltiled, has been muchincreased,andnow numbers43 objetat
			in all. These ara among the chief attractions and novelties which the palace offers for this season, and, if the festivals are not regarded with the sameengroccing Interest asmarked the great Handel Commemoration of last year, they are at least sufficiently attractive to give promise of a successful year. However, the programme is still capable of extension as the season progresses; and we think that one or two good out door f&amp;tcs for chilling visitors might be added with advantage, -

			STATISTICS OF REPRESENTATIONV.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-Referring to the inquiry and suggestion by Mr. Bovll In the House of Commons on Tuesday night for a return showing the " relative importance of boroughs " by taking " the number of houses to represent one figure, and the taxation to represent another figure," I venture to suggest that, from the official returns already published, showing for each county, city, and borough the population and total annual value of property, the Statistical Depart- ment at the Home-office, or the Board of Trade, would be able in 48 hours to present a comparative statement, show- ing tho relative Importance of ncah constituency, as indi- cated by Mr. Bovill.
			In such a compilation I would recommend the following easy and practlcable mode of arriving at and stating the result.
			To each connty, division, or borough, let there be stated the population in 1851 and the annual valne of property assessed to the poor-rate In 1859, and by adding together the two suns, and taking 10,000 as an unit, a mean or com- posite number will be deduced, which will be a clear and fair index of the claim of each place to Parliamentary regis- tration.
			Having arrived at these Index-nnmbers, or claims to re- present-ation, they would form the best and clearest data for the guidance of Parliament in dealing with the question of representation, and any proposal could be tested thereby.
			In the following examples the index number is arrived at by striking of the last four figures from the population and property returns, and aJdlng tisether the remainders:-
			The above will be sufficient to show the principle and. results of this plan.
			As an interesting statistical inquiry I have calculatedc tbo index number or claim of each borough or county, and the following summary of results may be interesting:-
			Comparative table, showing the index value of the popula-
			tion and property whlch nowv returns one member to Parliamlent (10,0001. of property and 10,000OpuElation, being the nnib of Index value):
			We are accustomed to consider that if population be ad- mitted as an olement of representation, Ireland is not fully represented. The above table shows that by uniting "popu- lation" with the "value of property" (the best known standard of the intelligence of a people) Ireland Is really over-represented.
			This plan ais to secure the full and fair influence of both elements-people and property. It can be applied in any wfay, according to any scale; It simnply acknowledges that people and property, the very objects of representation, should be f&lt;airly taken. A nd where large numbers of people exidst, as in some parts of Ireland, without a corresponding amnount of property, that they sh ould lo3e their prop ortionate share of representation.
			I am, Sir, yorur obedient servant.

			SixoGULan PHENO?rolON IN A SNOWSTORIT.- About two weeks ago a terrible snowstorm raged in Upper Wasdale, accompanied on Long-ton Be-ck and Swinhiope Fell by a singular rol-ing noise in the air, which resembled the noise of muisketry.' On the morning of the 16th nit, many of the shepherds proceseded on to the Fell to look- after their sheep, when they were astonished to findthe ground, for the space of a mile in, length end half a mile in width, covered with large piece of ice, which had dvidently fallen from the clouds. lt was as though a mountain of ice had been sud- denly shatteredl and the fragments scattered over the earth. The blocks were of such a size that, at a httle distance they resembled a flock of sheep. Providentially, neither sheep nor human beings were on that part of the moor during the storm, for to have been struck by one of these pieces of ice would have entailed instant death.
			UNFORTUNATE LEAvE-T_=RAS.-On Thursday la3t over 400 emigrants took their departure from this country for America by the mail steamec which left Queenstown for New York anid Portland. While the steamers were in the harbour a considerable number of country pesople, friends of the emigrants, accompanied them on beard, to hidl them farewell, intending to return either by boat or by ono of the steam tenders, which they supposed would remain alongside. To their dismay, however, the mails being placed on hoard, the steamers got under way, being bou-nd under heavy penalties to be on the route by a given time, and before any means could be procured to send the partles ashore the steamers were enreoutc to America, having 26 of them on beard. Several of these unlucky individuLals, who hove now a journey of some 5,000 miles before them to Amierica and back, had ac;tually left theircarts and some of the members of their families behind them in Queenstown, and the in- convenience and alarm occasioned by the unwelcome trip to which they have been treated may easily be imagined,- Cork' Coast itiftion.
			A VALUATLE WeTNEss.-At the Norfolk assies, on Tuesday, a rather ludicrous incident varied the mo- notony of a will ease which occupied the court for two days. One of the witnesses called by Mr. Serjeant Perry on behalf of the plaintiff was Mr. 0. F. Gale solicitor, of Cheltenham, wvho, en coming into the bar, deceine to answer any ques- tions untl he had received his expenses-viz., 31. 3s. per day for lees of time and travelling charges at IS. per mile. Mr. Gale statedl that he had passed six days in Norwich, waiting for the case to come before the court, and he clainmed 291. 12s., of which he had received Si. on account before leaving home. The Associate said the witness could only claim 11. is. per day, and his actual travelling charges. Mr. Gale con- tended that he was entitled to 31. 3s. per day when he was a;ay from horme. Eventually the Coart ordered that he should receive II. ls. per day for eight days, and his travelling expenses, including an allowance of 6f. for railway fares, in all about 161. As no arrange- ment had been made for payment at the mnoment, Mr. Gale was directed to leave the box, and anaother witness vwa called. Shortly afterwards hea aga2in presented for exa- y,!nation, upon which he raised the objection that he was still unpaid. After sOme little delay a chek- for the balance due to the witness was handed to him, and he then consented to heexamined. In reply toe question, whether he had made any communication to Mr. Hamiton, his town agent, with reference to the will, the valdity of which was disputed, he said he believed he had not, ad sr. Hamilton did not recolect anything being said opn the subject.

			AUfI TARY AND _AVAL JTELLIGE2 iC0.
			A large draught o0 troops wlU leave the camp at Colchester in May for India and China. The men have gone throug.- &amp; Primlinary course of rifle instruction, and ara now vait- ing orders to embark. The draught will be drawn from the following regiments:-1st battalion Ist Royals, 1 sergeant, 3 drummers, and 60 rank, and file; 1st battalon Gth Regl- ment, 4 sergeants and 59 rank and file; 54th, SO rank and file; 56th, 1 drummer and 139 rank and file; 66th, 4 sergets and 35 rank and filo; and 55th, 1 ser- geant, 1 drummer, and 1SS rcak and file; 1st bat- talion 5th Regiment, 129 rank and file; 34th, 75 rank and file; 37th, 1 sergeant, 1 drummer, and 1201 rank and file; 38th, 1 sergeant, 2 drummers, and 65 rank and file
			44th, 90 rank and file; and 97th, 80 rank and file; making a grand total of 12 sergeants, S drummers, and 1,319 rank and file. The draught of 90 rank and filo from the 44th, together with three officers, are actually under orders for China, and instractions for them to leave Col- chester are esDected daily. The strength of the force at present in the camp is as! follows:-9Mh battalion-2 field officers, 9 captains, 16 sobalterns, 7 staff sergeants, 40 sergeants, 20 drummers, and 1,127 rank and file; 10th battallon-2 field officers, 10 captains, 23 sabalterns, 6 staff sergeants, 52 sergeants, 17 drummers, and 1,505 rank and file; in all, 2,636 offlcers and men. Some 17 men of the 44th, 22 of the 66th, and 33 of the lst Royals. wbho have served 10 years in India, are about to receive their dlscharge after joining their depots in the camp.
			In consequence of the great increase vhich has recently taklen place in the detschments of Royal Engineers at head- quarters, Chatham-which, exclusive of the usual companies, now number 500 men-orders have been given for the forma- tion of three divislons, or depDt companies, each of which wil be under the sole charge or separate officers. One of these divisions has been already formed and placed under the com- mand of Capt. G. Langley,thu dep6tcompany coasisting of 10
			men. A second company wiL be formed on the 15th inst, and placed under the charge of Captain E. 0. Hlewett, who wil join head-quarters on that date for that purpose. Tne remaining portion of the deta-hment w.il still be under the charge of the Adjutant of Royal Engineers. Nearly the whole of the recruits who have recently joined this branch of the service are sldled mechanics and handicraftsmen, including draughtsmen, photographers, surveyors, and es- eravers.
			Uapt. Bruce and Brevet- Iajor Luldn have been ap- pointed to command the 9th and 10th batteries, newly formed and added to the deptlt at Woolwich, to contain the corps of clerks, orderlies, officers' servants, and other em- ployed men belonging to the garrison, of which the now bat- teries vill be exclusively composed. The organizatlon having been fouly carried out and the staff appointments filled, the new batteries will receive their R-at month's pay this morning.
			We have to record the demise of Colonel F. C. Irwin, ILH., formerly of the G3d Foot, and many years cosmadantrof the troops in Western Australia, which occurred at Cheltenbam a few days since, at an advanced age. The deceased officer entered the army on the 25th of March, lSOS, and served in the Peninsula from April, 1SD9, to February, 1814, including the capture of Oporto, battles of Talavera and Fuentes D'Onor, siege and storm of Culdad IPodrigo, siege of Badajoz and capture of the castle by escalade on the 7th of Aprll, 1S12, battle of Salamanca, capture of Madrid and the Retiro, battles of Vittoria and the Pyrenees, besides varlous affairs and skir. mLehes on the advance and retreat of the army. He als
			served the Kandyan campaigns in 1817 and 1818 in Ceylon. He was gazetted commandant of the troops in Western Australia In 1839, where he remained until he retired from the army in 1855. He has received the war medal and nine clasps for his valuable services.
			Her Majesty's steam storeshlp Rhadamauthes, Master- Commander Frederic Sturdee, having undergone an entire renovation of her engines and machinery in the river, oft Woolwich dockyard, and n thorough inspection of her bollers, is ordered to steam down the river on a trial of her speed, and a verification of her precise consumptlon of fuel under a supply of 'ordinary steam alone. Their Lordships have signified their desire that special care shaU bs taken to notifyminutelyeverycircumstancerelativetotheabovenameI particulars, and that a report may be promptly forwarded thereof to the Board of Admiralty for their consideration. The order farther adds that the Rhadamanthus immediately after her trial will be fitted, at the cost of Government,with the patent Improved apparatus of the Hon. John Wethered, a member of the United States' Congress, for the supply of combined or ordinary and superheated steam mixed, and which, it is stated, cannot fail, as proved by previone ex- periments, to increase the power of the engines, and also economise the consumption of fuel from 30 to 50 per cent. The mode adopted in carrying out the system is to attach another steam pipe to the bonler for conveying the steam to bh superheated to pipes, or other contrivances placed in any convenient form near the fire, or in the uptake or chimney of the boiler, or in a separate fur- nace; the superheated steam being added to the ordinary steam at or before its entrance into the cylinder. In Its passage through the superheating apparatus, that portion of the steam is raised by the vwaste heat to a temperature of 500 deg. or (100 deg. Fahrenheit. The heat thus arrested Is conveyed to and utilized in the cylinder by Its action on the other portion of steam from the boiler, which Is more or less saturated, according to circumstances. The combined steam is used in the cylinder atfrom 300 deg. to 450 deg. Fahrenheit, nstead of at the low temperature at which steam is gene- rally employed. The effect of using the two kinds of steam has already proved the fact that the superheated steam yields a portion of its excess of temperature to the ordinary steam, converttng the vesicular water, which it always con- tains, Into steam, and expanding it several Iundred-fold; while, at the same time, the ordinary steam ylelds a portion of its excess of moisture, converting the steam gas into a highly rarified elastic vapour-in other words, into pure steam at a high temperature. Repeatel endeavours have been made to employ steam sim- ply dried or superheated, aU of which have been partiaUy abandoned, as, owing to the high degree of temperature ne- cessary, the lubricating materials have dried up, and the packing and rubbing part3 of 'he machinery have been de- stroyed, and the temperature of the steam in the cylinder has been found to be beyond the control of the engineer. It Is asserted that Mr. Wethered's improvement, now about to bh adopted by the Admiralty, arose from the above-named difficulty.
			The paddle-wheel surveying vessel Bann, James S. Wells master, discharged her powder in Plymouth Sonnd on Thursday, and went into Eamoaze to have defects mado gooad.
			;Steam was got up on Thursday on board the Espolr, 5, and she went outside Plymouth Sound on trial for seversl hours.
			The crew of the screw steamship Donegal, 101, Capt. Henry Broadhead, were paid wages at Plymouth on Thurs- day by Admiral Superintendent SirThomasPasley, KLO.B., and they obtained leave of absence.
			Steam was got up on Thursday on board the screw steam- shlp Nile, 90, Capt. K. Barnard, and she went from Hamoaze into Plymouth Sound, where she saluted the flag.
			The sailing frigate Constance, 50, at Devonport, is to be lengthened 40 feet and fitted wlth a screw.
			The lower yards of the screw steamship Aboukir, 90, were sent down on Thursday.
			A letter has been received at Plymouth from tho screw steamship OrIlon, 91, Capt. John B. E. Frere. It Is dated Naples, March 13, and states that she left Maalta on the 7th, and arrived at Naples on the 10th. During the passage she sprang a leak, and had four feet vater in the hold. As the repairs cannot be accomplisbhed at Malta, she will have to come home. The leakage is said to be increased, if not caused, by the workLug of the machinery, in consequence of which she will retun under canvas only, and may be expected shortly at Ply- mouth.
			A further discharge of 75 mechanics and labourers will take place at Chatham dockyard this afternoon, including 20 shipwrights, 40 labourers, and 1Ssmit.hs, joiners, sawyers, and other mechamics. In consequence of the great extent to which the establishment at Cliatham was recently in- creased, there are still about 600 mechanics and labourers tea be dischargedbefore the number of worlmnenin the dockyard has been reduced to that ordered by the Admiralty for the ne.esnt vear.
			The Castor, 36, sRiling frigate, was towed on Thursday afternoon by two stemers from Chatham harbour to Pinope Peaeh, where she anchored for the night. She was to have left yesterday for Greenhithe to take up her position at thm moorings prepared for her in the Thames, where she wvil ba stationed for time to erve as the receiving-ship for the Naval Coast Volunteers. She has her main-deck guns on board, consisting of 18 32-pounders, each of 56 cwc., and 9ft. 6in. long.
			The Galatea, 26, screw frigate, 800 horse-power (nominall} has been undocked at Chatham, and ill proceed to Sheer- ness to join the steam reserve at that port.

			Sir,-I see that, by some mistake, your translation of the Papal Excommunlcation represents the decree as beinR igne,I by two officers, styled "Apostolical Curser" and " a;dster Courser." The fact is that the title of those officers Is COusor, a Latin term, signifying an officer who r,rveS process, &amp;c.

			FOREIGN JINTEIGENCE.
			FRANCE.
			(FROt OUIT OWN COIBESPOThXDET.)
			PARIS, TH7usDAY, APRIL 5, 6 P.m.
			in order to testify their admiration of the spirited conduct of M1. Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans, in h8s litigation with the 3iede and the heirs] of his predecessor, Bishop Rousseau, the citizens of Orleans have, by voluntary contributions, paid his law expenses. 3I.Berryer and 31. Dufaure have each received 4001. These gentlemen at first declined ac- cepting anything in the shape of remuneration, but were subsequently induced to change their minds. One of the results of that ill-advized and unsuccess- ful prosecution is, that A.L Duparloup is now looked npon as the head of the Church in France.
			" Qui s'exuse s'acecse." There is clearly an uneasy feeling here lest it should be thought among the mass of the raral population that the Emperor Napoleon is comprised in the eicommunication or censure which has been promulgated at Rome The note in the Moniteur some days back, warning the public that no Papal bulls, rescripts, briefs, &amp;c., could be introduced into France without an in- fraction of the organic laws of the Concordat; the dogging by a police emissary of M. Louis Veuillot's footsteps during his journeyto Rome, his stay there, and his return to Paris; and the elaborate articles in this day's Condit tionnd, signed, it is true, by AL Grandguiaot, but most probably fur- nished by authority, all indicate nervousness on the subject, as well as an earnest desire to remove any impression unfavourable to the Imperial Go- vern-nent. It is true that French soldiers did not Invade the Romagna, and that no portion of the Pontifical States has been annexed to France. But Is it true that France has had no part, direct or in- direct, in the act? Is it true that there has been no participation, morally or materially, in it? Is it denied that the annexation of Savoy to France has been a censequence of the annexation of the Romagna to Piedmont, and was projected from the beginning ? Who wrote the pamphlet Le Pape et la ConeWres, fiercely denounced by the Pope as a tissue of sophistry and hypocrisy ? If you look at the map of the Europe of 1860, which was thrown out as a feeler in 1858, and, when the public mind got used to the discussion of the contemplated ehanges, was suddenly withdrawn from public sight, you will find that the portion of the Roman States, the annexation of which has drawn forth the censures of the Vatican, is laid down as forming part of the projected Italian kingdom. So, to be sure, is Venetia; but if the eagles did not sweep over the waters of the Adriatic, it was not for want of good will on the partof those Imperial birds. It is true, as the Conwtitutionne remarks, that the French army is still at Rome to protect the Pope. But the city of PRome vras reserved for the Pope by the programme traced in the pamphlet. The Im- perial Government probably cares very little about Papal excommunications or cen.ures; but there is clearly great anxiety to show to the French clergy and the provinces that it is not touched by them. It is not forgotten that the object for which Prince 3?Tapoleon's corps d'arm4c went to Italy was to force the Austrians to evacuate the Romagna; and the evacuation of the Romagna was folowed by the revolt of those provinces. The Prince, indeed, con- gratulates himself on having by that manceuvre con- tributed to the success of the campaign. If this be not "anbetting, promoting, inducing," &amp;c., it is hard to say what ss.
			Talking of excommunication, I may observo that the one given by the SiPlde some days back, and which may have been copied from Tridtram S)1andy, was not the invention of Sterne, but was no doubt taken by him from Etienne Balu7e, who published at the close of the 17th century his Capitusaires, in a volume of which I have just read the formula in question, under the heae of "FormuLm veteres exorcismorum et exco-amunicationum."
			The Journal des Debats, speaking of the last abor- tive attempt at insurrection in Spain, strongly and justly reprobates "the conduct of a general who abandons his post to attack with armed hand his Sovereign and his country," &amp;c. No doubt the Dedats Is quite right; it would, however, be better not to dweeU long or often on such a theme, as there is hardly a general on the present establish- ment in Spain, beginning with O'Donnell himself, who has not more than once " attacked with armed hand," &amp;c., and in this figurative style put himself at the head of an insurrection aaainst the constituted Government of the day. To the successful insur- rection-but to which, I suppose, we must not npply that " foul dishonouring word" because it succeeded-of Vicalvaro,O'Donnell oweshismarahal's staff; so do several of his comrades. To the suc- ctf ul one of 1843 he owed the post of Captain- General of Cuba, and the vast wealth which he amassed during his four or five years' occupancy. To the unswUcessfil rebellion of 1841 he owed his two years' exi]e. For a long time there was no better means of advancement in Spain than a well- planned and well-finished pronun-iamiento; and, if Ortega succeeded, promotion and honours were sure to be his. The Debats, then, must reflect a little; vwhile it denounces the luckless Ortega it scourges, without knowing It, not a few of the moat distin- guished generals of the army.
			The steel-plated frigate Normandie, launched at Cherbourg on the 10th of March, is being prepared for sea with the utmost despatch. It is expected that her trial will throw great light on the efficacy, during a maritime war, of ships cased in a species of enirass.
			The Toulon fleet has sailed, but not on a political mission as was asserted by the French papers, but merely to exerc!se the crews, and to try some new naval manceuvres sugaested by the Emperor. The Toulon fleet, which is now at anchor in the roada off the islands of Hlyeree, is com- manded by Admiral de Tinan, and is composed of the screw ship of the Lne Bretagne, bearing his flag; the screw ship 1onauwerth, hearing the flag of
			hdmiral Jehenne, and the screw ship3 Alexandre, Eylau, asd Saint Louis. Adrniral de Tinan is to be reinforced by the Brest fleet, commanded by Admiral Paris, composed of three ships of the line -the steam-frigate Foudre, now at Nice, and by the steel-plated frigates the G!oire and the gormandie.

Last night there as som mild rain, and this morning rose-trees and other garden plants how an appWearanc of putting forth loaves. The day is mild, hut cloudy.

			NAPLES.
			(FBROM OUR OWN COIRtPOWDEN.)
			NAPLES, MAStca 31.
			The official ": correspondence" on Naples has pro- duced an immense sensation here, and, with very !ew exceptions, all 3re united in lauding and thanl, ing the outspoken Mlinister wrho has so boldly and honestly told the truth. I have not read, however, that correspondence without a feeling of regret that so much interest should have been expressed for a famnily wiho for half a century have governed this country wiith almost incredi- ble ferocity, and who have baffled foreign di- plomacy by the low and cunning arts to which the uweak lways resort. As Frahce has her idea, so, I suppose, England thirsa she must have hers, and the
			Bourbons at Naples are one of these ideas. Anti- Gallic in its origin as thia idea is, it is pregnant with misfortune for the Two Sicilies, and the sooner it is got rid of the better for local interests and the peace of Europe. The better would it be, too, for the in- terests of England, for, as water flowsintothe ocean, so does every country gravitate towards that to which it has the greatest natural affinity, in spite of political or dynastic changes. To us on the spot, who have been behind the scenes for many years, the counsels of Lord John Russell sound like a solemn farce. "You wil press strongly on the prin- cipal Minister of the Crown," he says on the 6th of July, 1859, " the necessity of abolishing as soon as po5sible the despotism of the polce ," and from that moment down to the hour at which I am writ- ing cruelties and illegalities have been committed which it would be difficult to parallel in the recent history of any other country. Instances are given where promises had been violated and dliplomacy deceived by officials and by Royalty, and yet a desire is expressed to maintain the present dynasty on the throne of Naples. Whence this love of the Bourbons? TLey have cost their country unheard-of misery, Europe much disquietude, and England vast sums of money, wldich have been repaid only with contumely and insult. "H His Mlajesty and his Mtinisters consider themselves the proper judges of the requirements of this coun- try," said Signor Carafa in November last. Yet more counsel, more sympathy for the family, follow, until in MIarch aU decency is outraged by the excesses of the " family" throuah its Minister of Police. For dignity's sake, if a British Minister continue to reside at this Court, let us desist from casting our pearls before those who only turn again and rend us, or else let us concert honestly and frankly with France and Piedmont some measures for the resto- ration of law. Either nothing or a bold stroke. While counsel and sympathy are given in high places to those who insultingly declare that they do not w;ant either, it is curious to mark the counsel given to the Liberals, which is, "not to present any petition or take any step which might be, or which might be considered, illegal." ComDare with this the declaration of Signor Carafa, "^' that he looks upon all those as revolutionists who ' desire' changes in the institutions of the country contrary to the will of the Government." Thus it comes to this,-that the British Government counsels the Liberals not to think or feel in favour of any changes, while our statesmen brand them as cowards, and unworthy of the liberty for which they are not prepared to make any sacrifice.
			The correspondence could scarcely have been read when,with breathlesshaste, the Government prepared its answer. On Thursday7 morning, when the streets were fuil of people, a detachment of 12 prisoners was brought down from the P'rison of Santa Maria Appa- rente, first to the Prefecture and afterwards to the Immacolatella, and thence shipDed off to Capri in exile. They were handu-affed two-and-two, and all bozind together by a long rope, as horses are bound 2ohen taken to afair. Exile, it must be observed, too, is the next or the next bui; one degree of punishment after " irons." As they passed along the streets, followed by an indiDgnant; crowd, aud guarded by 10 Gendarmes, many were heard saying, " Here t'hey are again arresting galantuomini, and we dying of hunger." Treated in every respect as condemned malefactors, these men, however, had never been accused or tried ; they were laid hold of at the beginning of the month for the sake of " public tranquillity," and shut up in prison. To the 12 of whom I have spoken another was added from the Vicaria, and as a matter of favour thev were sent into exile. Anong them I find a hatter, a commercial clerk, and a civil engineer. Several of them are arrested for the third or fourth time; al ways in the same capricious and illegal manner, and are rained men. Ha iv mnnV the.iisn1;nrAt tarA
			in the country who in like manijer have been ruined ? It was observed that the wrists of one of these men, Giuseppe Demata, had been bound so tight as to bring blood. Of course these men, taken from their occupations and their families, are in training for conspirators. Since I wrote other arrests for poli- tical reasons have taken place, and the places of those released or exiled asre immediately filled up.
			I confine myself to simply announcing for the present the trial of Padre Giuseppe de Pescolan- clano for having excited the people against the Royal authority in using the words " unity" and "fraternity" in a sermon, and entreating the people to pray for the peace of unhappy Italy. I understand that the special court urges against him the 140th Article of the Code, which fixes the punishment of decspitation for such a crime.
			You have been from time to time informed by me of the Austrian recruits which arrive here, and I mnust beg your particular attention to the follo wing more precise details. From 120 to 150 are brought over a-week, every Thursday, by Lloyd's steamer from Trieste for Molfetta. They are principally Aus- trians, though a gentleman vwho attended the arrival of one convoy says there was one native of Trieste, some Bavarians, B3ohemians, Illyrians, and Croats. They were in rags, with the exception of the soar-oglcier who accompanied them. According to the lists, which have been examined by a friend, the dates of their birth were from 1824-56-7, and they were all soldiers whose time of service the Austrian army had expired. At Trieste and Mol- fetta are Neapolitan agents, and at the latter place are established omnibuses, which run to Avellino where some of the recruits are deposited, and others are sent on to Nocera. The bounty- money is 110 to 120 ducats each, of which 10 ducats are paid on their landing. It is said that Austria has the undoubted right of selling or permitting the sale of its industry as England and France have done; but I must remark that up to thiz time it has been prohibited, and the permission which has been given now is, to say the least, most suspicious and menacing. In 1623 the Neapolitan G-overn- ment,wlshlnt to terminate the Austrian occupation, entered into a capitulation with the Swiss Govern- ment for the supply of recruit6s. Austria opposed i,vihntokeep up ths occupation; but, through teifuneof the French Government and the in- structions sent to their M&amp;inister at Berne, the capi- tulation was completed. Austria, therefore, unable to effect anything, protested, and obtained from the Federal Government a promise not to recruit in the Austrian States, and from Naples a pro- mise not to accept such recruits. The prohibi- tion has now been broken for the first time. There is no reason why the number of recruits should be limited to the present weekly figure, and according to arrangements which are made we may shortly have an Austrian. army established in the South of Italy, full of menace to the now Kingdom of Central Italy. as fcr the Government of the Two Sicilies, it has a large native army, can com- mand any number of men, and it asserts that its States are in a condition of the most enviable tran- quDlity. Vnder al these circumstances it ap- pears to me that Austria may well be asked why she has given a permission to recruit, hitherto refused; and Naples, with such a " happy family" and such unlimited resources, may be asked why she enliats a foreign force, thereby menaoing the peace of Italy.
			His HToliness has sent down to Naples for a Swiss officer or two, and Captain Kirt, among others, left on the 27th or 28th, End will take the rank of Major in the Papal service.
			A hurried order was aent to the arsenal on the evening of the 28th for 1,000 muskets, which were to be Eent to the Abruzz! for the use of the Urban Guard, who are, as I have already told you, mobilized, and paid two carlini a day. The order was executed in tvo hours, and excites the more surprise as this Government is so reluctant to give out arms; indeed, though for the present all intention of passing the frontier seems to be suis- pended, we are here arming to the teeth and pre- paring for eve:y eventuality and every folly. Nor is the navy neglected, as Signor De Luca, Engineer in the Royal Marines, has been despatched to London, and has bougat two steanmvessels of 30 guns, at the price of 680,000 ducats each. They were constructed originaly, I believe, for the use of the Pasha of Egypt.
			Prince Castelcicala has arrived from Sicily, and, if I am rightly informed, will not return. His family havo come up with him, and have brought up many articles of furniture. Tlhe Prince, who accepted the Viceroyalty with reluctance, will probably be re- placed ultimately by a Royal Prince, perhaps the Count of Trani-the eldest son of his ambitious mother, the widow of Ferdinand IL
			Baron Brenier had an audience of His MIajesty la-t Tuesday, which was, I imagine, far from satis- factory to his Excellency. It was a public audience, so that I conclude no important communications were made to His Majesty; but you may rest asured that counsel was given to make some change in the system of government, aad that t-hat counsel was received asA all other counsel has been received
			-" No change will be effected." The present system is founded on the " Book of Institu- tions," and is supposed to be under the protection of the Madonna Immacolata.
			The Nuncio and the Archbishop of Naples have been in frequent communication with the King this week, and the telegraph to Rome has for days been exclusively engaged by the Government.
			Her Iajesty has changed her confessor-no unim- portant fact in a country where confessors are the secret springs of action. Sabelli, who was also the confessor of the Queen MIother, has been re- placed by Monsignor Eicholzer, a Swiss, formerly the confessor of the Princess of Salerno. I look upon the change as an act. of robellion against the Queen Mother.
			Schisms are spoken of in the Minitry, but nothing has been done as yet to show that the new men are assuming any action independent of the Camarilla.
			Nothing can be worse than the state of commerce, and prudence woald dictate to all foreign merchants to limit their transactions with Naples. Shopkeepers from the provinces are almost prohibited from coming up to Naples, so great are the difficulties thrown in the way of procuring passports; and people in the capital spend as little as pos- sible, reserving every grano for those stormy times which it is apprehended are approach- ing. The consequences are that credit is rotten, and bankruptcies frequent. The new commercial tariff has of course awakened little interest, and you will be surprised to hear that letters from Messina, dated the 26th inst., say that it had not been offi- cially communicated there as yet, and that the old tariff was being acted upon. There are strange ramours In circulation regarding an approaching rising in Sicily, which I will not notice more falny.

			THlE PAPAL STATEq-
			(FRO3I OUR OWN CORR1SPONDFNT.)
			ROME, MARCH 29.
			The great Papal bombshell, or Apostolic pop- gun, haa gone off: Festerday, in the morning, a boroad sheet of printed paper was pasted up on the doors of Sb. John of Lateran, of St. Peter's, in the Vatican, on the piUlars of the Cancelleria, of the Curia, and at the corners of the Piazza di Fiori- the places officially designated for the promulgation of all Bulls. That paper purported to be the RxcommnunicatiolMajor against the Sardinian Govern- ment, " aU its Alinisters, counselors, abettors, and favourers, panderers and go-betweens (faczcendieri ed intriganti), who hadat any time had a haud in bringing about the dishonour of the State of the Church." It is couched somewhat in the same terms as the one launched against the First Napoleon. It was pro- mulgated in St. Peter's on the 26th, so that my anticipation was wrong only by one day.
			At aU the spots where the placard was affixed a band of Gendarmes was appointed to do duty before it. The Government weU knows how long other- wise that poor rag4of paper would hang on the waUs, if left to the mercy of the Romans.
			No people in the world, as you well know, is less to be moved-nay, no people is more ready to be moved-to laughter by the noise of this Vatican artillery than these same Romans are, and have been time out of mind. Even at the present day, whenever a shabby feUow on a brokendown horse comes tramping clumsily through the streets of Rome or of the provincial towns, with the boys squealing and the curs yelping at his heels, the people roused by the din and clatter wil look up and say, with that peculiar drawl which is cha- rac+ftristic of the Romans, "C Porta la scommunica a Fe,rrara" ("Heisbearerof the Bull againstFerrara"), a sneer perpetuated among the lower classes ever since the time that Leo X. tried with these same thunders to shake the ambitious purpose of Alfonzo I. of Este, and got as much for it as Pius IX. wiU ever get.
			Monsignor Merode and General LamoriciQre landed at Ancona on Monday last, and are ex- pected here this very day. I had informed you before that Merode was reported to have failed in his minion, which was to propose the supreme command of the holy league of Rome, Naples, Austria, &amp;c., to the exiled French General. It seems now that he has changed the gallant General's mind, since here he is. Five thousand Germans and a regiment of cavalry are expected to land at Ancona. The Pontifical corvette which had gone to Toulon to arm has come back to Civita Vecchia; she carries eight guns in one battery aud one piece on deck,-a formidable armament for the Fisherman's boat. Her present ulse is merely to carry arms and ammunition to Ancona.
			The Pope orders prayers ; then three-day prayers (tridui); then nine days' prayers (nervne) ; all man- ner of penances and processions. The church-walls are white al over with "holy call" (inviti sacri) upon the faithful, soliciting their zeal, "that God may please to take pity on his Bride, afHicted by so many evils, brought upon her by her most un- grateful sons." ln the Church of St. Joseph of the Carpenters (San Giuseppe dei Falegnami) " a miraculous image of the crucifix will be ex- hibited, with a view to ward off the calamities impending on religion, on Italy, and espe- cally on Rome." This very moment (half-past 4 p.m.) I have met a procession of penitents slowly wending its way to th Vatican, all made up of MIonsiguors and nobles. Monsignor Viteleschi led the band, bending under the weight of a huge cross. In his footsteps, two by two, clothed in sable, book in hand, came the rest, chanting the "Seven Penitential Psalms :" I recognized Prince Altieri, the Marquises Viteileschi, the Princes Doria, Chigi, Barberini; Dukes Grazioli, Marino Torlonia, Ranieri; the Patrizi, Marquis Antici, Marquis Dei-Cinque; Princes Corsini, Aldobran- dia, Salviati; the son of Prince Piombino, Prince Massimo, Count Carpegna, Santa Croce, and ever so many of these princes of the HolyChurch, so ready to hold a candle to that Pope, for whom not one of the whole noble herd would draw a sword.
			The Pope in his turn is also expected to make his appearance in a procession on Sunday next ; and on Good Friday he will go through the ordeal of the tre ore di agonia. I do not know on what ground the report stands, but the Pope's sanctity is just now at its frantic pitch, and, as his admirers say, he is " up to everything" (capace di tutto).
			Since the panio of the 19th ult., which emptied the Roman hotels and lodging-houses, strangers are flocking back, but they are an odd set-faces with which the Piazza di Spagna and Via Babuino are quite unfamiliar. They are mostly Catholics, and an anonymons society has been established under- taking to defray their expenses. Yesterday's last train from Civita Vecchia brought 160 persons. Of these 120 were housed in a convent on the Jani- comum. They were under the gruidance of a Belgian Monsignore. Others were taken to the Mlinerva. Nuns also, white, brown, and gray, have arrived, under the faithful escort of certain good priests. These strangers of both sexes are mostly persons be- tween 35 and 40 years of age. Some thousands are expected to come in daily. They are intended for a monster demonstration on Easter-day.

			AUSTRIA.
			(FROM OUR OWNh CORRESPONDET.)
			VIENNA, APRMr 3.
			A few days ago you learnt from me that Prussia had been defeated in the German Diet on the ques- tion of the Hesse-Cassel Constitution, and I can now give yo1 some detailed information on the subject. The majority in favour of .the Constitution of 1852, which was imposed on the inhabitants of the Elec- torate by the Bund, was formed by Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, Wurtemberg, Baden, the Grand- Duchy of Hesse, Holstein, Brunswick and Namau, MIecklenburg, Oldenburg, Anhalt, and Schwarzburg, Lichtenstein,I Reuss, Lippe, Schaumburg Lippe, and Waldeck. The minority consisted of but three curie, namely, Prussia, the Grand-Ducal and Ducal Saxon States, and the four free cities. Austria voted infavourof the ocroi of 1852, because she isof ouinion that Sovereigns ought not to yield to their subjects. Bavaria declared the promulgation of the Constitu- tion of 1852 to be a definitive repeal (endiUige Aufheung) of the charter of 1831. Saxony was of opinion that Prussia was guilty of inconsistency, in- asmuch as she assisted in drawing up the Constltution of 1852. Hanover considered the charter of 1831 pernicious, and thought it wouild be wrong to intro- duce any of its conditions or regulations into the Constitution of 1852. The representative of Meck- lenburg, who in 1852 was the referendary in the matter in question, thougtht that the Bunid had gone beyond its tether, inasmuch as it had given to the Hesse Cas3el Estates " more than they had de- manded," a method of procoeding which was not in k-eping with Article 55 of the Finl ActofConfedera. tion. Severalofthemembersofthemajorityexpressed a hope that the Electoral Government would make more concessions to the estates. The reprezentative of Prus6ia maintained that the Bund had no ri_ght
			altogetlaer to do away with the charter of 1831, and proposed, first, to let a committee of the Bund examine the Constitation of 1831, and; point out those parts of it which wre opposed to the federal laws; second, to desire the Electoral Govermnent
			to suspend the Constitution of 1852, and such parts, of the charter of 1831 as are not in keeping with the fundamental laws (gnmudgesetze) of the Bund; third, to convoke the Estates, and desire them to submit the revised Constitution of 1831 to the Electoral Government. The propositions of Prussia were re- jected, but she returned to the charge on the 29th of March, and announced to her confederates that she did not consider herself bound by the resolu- tion taken by a majority of the Federal States on the preceding Thursday. The Austriam urge that the Prussian Government assisted in drawing up the Constitution which she now objects to, and the charge is well founded; but it must be recol- lected that in 1852 the Berlin Cabinet was subjected to very great moral pressure by Austria and the Bund.
			On the 29th and 30th of Miarch there were extremely animated debates in the Baden Diet respecting the Concordat, and when the House divided on a motion made by a member of the Cabinet it was found that there was a majority of three to one-45 votes to 15-against Ministers. The attitude assumed by the Carls- ruhe Diet must greatly annoy this Government, as it had flattered itself that the Concordat would meet with no more opposition in Baden tnan it did in Wurtemberg. When Baron d'Ow, who is now the representativo of Wurtemberg at this Court, con- cluded a Concordat at Rome about two years ago, the Ultramontanists in this city rejoiced greatly, and I recollect to have heard that Baron von Mey- senbug, who is one of the leading men in the Austrian Foreign-office, was " delighted" when he learnt from his brother, the Minister of State in Baden, that Rome had succeeded in securing a footing in tho Grand Duchy. By a telegram of the 2d inst. from Carlsruhe we learn that Baron von Meysenbug and] Baron von Sten- gel,-the latter as Minister of the Interior and Justice,-are likely to quit office. Messrs. Stabel and Lamey are mentioned as the successors of Messrs. von Meysenbug and StengeL
			A few days since there was a slight political demonstration during a concert which was given by M. von Billow, the pianist, in the Redoute in this city. M. von Bilow played an Hungarian rhapsody bv Liszt, in which there are reminiscences of the Rakotzy March, and the public gave a very noisy expression to the pleasure caused by the well- kno=n sounds. The thing, which was ignored by the authorities,would neverhave been known to the general public if the Donu Zeitumq had not thought fit to administer a philippic to the persons who iuterrupted M. von Billow by their vociferous applause. By private letters from Pesth I learn that M. de Forinyac, who was wounded in the leg on the 18th of March, is not likely to recover. M. Witt von Dorring, who is at the head of an establshment in this city forsupplying foreign newspapers and their corre- spondents with genuine (Austrian) information, had yesterday a paralytic stroke, which partially deprived him of the power of moving his limbs on the left side. Count Frimont's head was opened soon after he expired, and it was found that the bullet was lodged behind the lower part of the frontal bone (osfrontis).
			The Archduke Ferdinand MIax came to this city yesterday. While at Trieste General Lamoriciere told a friend with whom he dined that there would be no difficulty in raising 30,000 men in France for the Papal service.
			In consequence of favourable news from England there was a slight improvement on 'Change to-day.

			TURKEY.
			(FEoM OUV OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
			CONSTANTINOPLE, IAncu 28.
			The month of Ramazan commenced on Friday. The fast enjoined on all Mussulmans during this month lasts from the rising to the setting of the san. In the Interval all gratification of the senses -even the chibouk-is prohibited. There is, per- haps, no groat hardship in the due observance of the abstinence thus enjoined when it happens at a con- venient season. As, however, the 12 months into which the Turks divide their year are lunar months, and as they have no provision ana- logous to that of our leap-year, the Ramazat, in common with aU their other months, bears no relation to any one particular season, but tra- verses In succession aU the periods of our solar year. It may be easy to abstain from food from sunrise to sunset in our month of Docember, whereas a simi- lar penance in June must be found a severe test of the faith no less than of the stomach of the trae believer. It is singalar that the religion of Maho- met, so admirably adapted in most respects to the welfare of his followers, should be thus at fault in the division of time, a matter which seriously affects two of the most important of its ordinances -viz&gt;, pilgrimage and fasting. To make up for the abstinence of the day there has always been great feasting at night. Only a few years ago aU the richer of the Mussulman population were in the habit of opening their doors at sunset to admit all comers into tbtir houses, where tables were spread and dinners provided for a large number of self- invited guests. This hospitality, which was found too heavy a tax on the liberality of those who exercised it, has been somewhat retrenched of late years; uevertheless, up to the present moment every householder is expected during each night of Ramazan to provide entertainment for a large num- ber of people in case of any of his friends happening to honour him with a visit. A notification has this year been issued to the effect that all employes of the Porte will do well to abstain from the old practice, at least so far as their superiors are con- cerned. Ittells them, in short, not to come to dinner uninvited, but to wait until they are asked.
			It is high time that some decelve steps should be talken by our Government to force the Ministers of the Sultan to a settlement of the large claims of British subjects ariing out of the massacre at Djiddah. On the 15th of June, 1858, the outbreak which, notwithstanding aU that has been said in paUlation, must for ever remain a dark spot upon the reputation of the Government under which such things could happen, occurred. It Is not necessary now to recapitulate any of the horrors then per- petrated,--enough to know that three Com- miissioners, appointed by the English, French, and Turkish Governments respectively, and who sat and received evidence on the spot where the outrage was committed, unanimously arrived at the conclu- sion that nothing could be said in its justification. In conformity with their decision some of the cul- prits then suffered, and others are stiUl undergoing the penalty of their crime. The first act of atone- ment thus performed, it remained to ascertain what was the amount of pecuniary damage done to French and English subjects-what the compensa- tion to be made. The claims were sent in to the Commission, and a large mass of evidence in support of them was adduced. The result, so far as English interests are concerned, is a demand on the Turkish Government for a sum of about 130,0001. to which the claims have, on due examination, been reduced. One would have imaogied that, after all its professions of horror and regret on the subject of the massacre, the Porte would have manifested a readiness-even an eager- ness-to bring the matter to a satisfactory con- clusion. ' It does not appear that Mfr. Walne, the British Commissioner, has shown any undue par- tialitv for those whose Interests were intrueted to
			his care. Nevertheless, it l'arklsh iniste were not satisfied on the question of amount, it behoved them to take steps for its adjustment, provided those steps did not militate against any positive de- cision of the commission. It behoved them above ali to take such steps as they deemed proper with- out loss of time. Mfuch of the property in respect to which the claims arise found its way into the hands of officers of the Government. They have not only killed, they have also taken possession. If ever there were a wrong calling for speedy redress it is that under consideration. Since the conclusion of the labours of the Commission literally nothing has been done by the Turkish Government. MIr. Walne, the British Commissioner, and who is also Her Majesty's Consul at Cairo, has been here- absent from his official duties-for four months. Yet, so far as I can ascertain, he has been enabled to make no progress whatever towards a settlement of the business on which he came. I know not with what degree of urgency our Ambassador has insisted on the adjustment of the claims, but this I do know from experience, that unless a very hightone be made use of in the re- monstrances of our Government to the Porte, no- thing beyond assurances will be obtainedL Lord Stratford de Redcliffe has been frequently cen- sured for employing In his dealings with the
			Turkish Government harsh' and imperious language, when conciliatory terms would have effected the object in view. He knew the people with whomhe had to deaL He knew that here, as throughout the East, the language of conciliation is apt to be regarded as that of weakness; and it was, I take it, to this knowledge that he owed much of the enor- mous influence w;hich he exercised while in this country.
			At this time, above all others, there should be no difficulty in getting such claims settled. Turkish Ministers are urging what they consider the claims of their Government to a revision of the treaties which prohibit the imposition of direct taxes on foreigners residing in the Sultan's dominions. They are also at the present moment appealing to the goodwill and liberality of the alien inhabitants of Constantinople to induce them to submit to a tax illegal in itself, and ren- dered doubly obnoxious to censure, from the mode of its imposition-n tax which the pGovernment sought to enforce at first by menaces and in one instance by actual violence. On the propriety of the imposition in question I will not now dilate. I have in a previous letter expressed myself upon this point. Sulrely, however, when the Turkish Mtinisters are urgent in their request that we should pay them, as matter of favour, what is not legally due, they should not withhold that which we claim and they admit to be matte. of rkhte

			AAfERIOAN NVSTITUTIONS.
			The New York paDers contain the following letter written in 1857 by the late Lard Aacaulay to Mr. H. S. Randall, of New York:-
			" Holly-lodge, Kenstngton, London, May 23, 1857.
			"Dear Slr,-You are surprised to learn that I have not a high opinion of Mr. Jefferson, and I am surprised at your surprise. I am certain that I never wrote a line, and that I never, in Parliament, in conversation, or even on the hustings-a placo where it is the fashion to court the popu- lace-uttered a word indicating an opinion that the supreme authority in a State ought to be intrusted to the majority of citizens told by the head; in other words, to the poorest and most ignorant part of society. I have long been convinced that institutions purely democratic must, sooner or later, destroy liberty, or civilization, or both.
			" In Europe, where the population is dense, the effect of such institutions would bh almost instantaneous. What happened lately in France is an example.
			"You may think that your country enjoys an exemption from these evils. I wiUl frankly own to you that I am of a very different opinion. Your fateI believe tohe certain, though it is deforred by a physical cause. As long as you have a bounDless extent of fertile and uoccupied land your labouring population wiU bh far more at ease than tho la- bouring population of the old world ; aud, whlle that is the case, the Jeffersonian polioy may continue to exist v;ithout causing any fatal calamity. Bat the time wiUl come -when Newv England will ho as thickly peopled as Old England. Wages will be as low, and will 'ductuate as much with you as w;ith us. You will have your MIanchesters end your Blir- minghams; and in those Iafachestecs and Birmniaghams hundreds of thousands of artisans will assuredly be some- times out of work. Then your Institutions wil be fairly brought to the test. Distress everywhere makes the labourer mutinous and disoontented, and inclines him to listen with eagerness to aitators, who tell him that it is a monstrous Iniquity that one man shonld have a million while another cannot gct a full meal. In had years there is plenty of
			grumbling here, and sometimes a little rioting; ~but' it matters little, for here the sufferers ace not the rulers. The supreme powrer is In the hands of a class, numerous indeed, hut select-of an educated class-of a claSS which is and knowis itself to be deeply in- terested in the sreurity of property and the maintenance of order. Accordingly, the malcontents are firmly but gently restrained. The bad time is got over without robbing the wealthy to relieve the indigent. The springs of national prosperity soon begin to 'dow again; work is plen- tiful, wag,es rise, and all is tranquillity and cheerfulness. I have seen England pass three or four times through such critical seasons as I have described. Through such seasons the United States will have to pass in the course of the next century, if not of this. How wil you pas through them ? I heartily wish yon a good deliverance. Bet my reason and my wishes are at war, and I cannot help foreboding the worst. It is quite plain that your Government wil never be able to restrain a distressed and discontented majority, for with you the majority is the Government, and has the rich, who are always a minority, absolutely at its mercy. The day wfll come when, in the State of Now York, a mul- titude of people, not one of whom has had more than half a breakfast, or expeets to have more than half a dinner, wiU choose a Legislature. Is it possible to doubt what sort of Legislature will bo chosen!9 On one side is a states. man preaching patience, respect for vested rlghts, strict observance of publie faith. On the other is a demagogue ranting about the tyranny of capitalists and usurers, and asking why anybody should he permitted to drink cham- pagne and to ride In a carriage while thousands of honest folks are in want of eceesearies. Which of the two candi- dates is likely to be preferred by a working man who hears his chUidren crying for more bread? I seriously apprehend that you will, in somo uch season of adversity as I have described, do things which will prevent prosprity from returning. Either some Caessr or NEapoleon wsl seize the reins of goverument with a strong hand; or your republic will be as fearfnhlyvpluadered and laid waste by barbarians in the 20th century as the Roman empire was in the 5th; w ith this diffcrence, that the Eluns and Vandals who ravaged the Roman empire came from without, and that your enus and Vandals will have been en dered within your own country by your own institutions.
			" Thinkin thus,of courseI caunot reckonJefferson among the benefacto'rs of mankind. I readily admlt that his in. tentions were good and his abiities considerable. Odious stories have been circulated about his private life; but I do not know on what evidence those stories rest;* and I think it probable that they are false, or monstrously eaggerated. I have no doubt that I shall derive both pleasure and infor- mation from your account of him.
			"I have the hononr to be, dear Sir, your faithful sErvant,
			M."H. S. RandaIL" 1"T. B. MACAULAY.

			STEAM SKIRMISHERS.
			TO THE EDITO) OF THE ThEES.
			Sir,-One of the results of the Whitworth cannon appears to have escaped notice. HIitherto, owing to the great strength of construction required in men of war for their heavy ordnance, such vessels have remained quite distinct from other vessels. Bntif It be true that a light telescope. looking tube like the Whitworth 3-pounder can throw a 12- pound shot, it results that even a penny river boat may be made into a formidable vessel of war. Take a few fast little steamers such as the Dover packets, and arm each with a formidable Whitworth proportionate to its size, and what hope would a French invading force have of successfully landingin boats in our shallow waters?
			Imagine, also, 500 or 1,000 such vessels noting as steam skirmihers to our fleet, and concentrating their fire on the gigantic fleating targets of the enemy, who would have no hopeof coming to close quarters as with unwieldy gan. boats. The principle of concentric fire, as illustrated in the attack of a fortress, where a few gums In a distant parallel rapidly sUence the batteries of the defence, will enable us to judge of the result. England, and England alone, has sxch an auxilary force always at hand.

			Fnxsci T-ADL.-The Moniteur publshes thD fol- lowing observations :-"The Treatyof Coemnerceconcluded between France and Eng1and is scarcely two months old, especillUy if the date of the exchange of the ratifications be ta en ito account, and yet already, we are happy to state, It begins to exiercise a favourable influence on the export trade of France. It is known that the resolut-ions of the House of Commons are generally carried into effect after a first vote, before being drawn up in Acts. Most of the exemptions and reductions of duties which Interest us were consequently on the other side of the Channel made ap- picable in the course of February and MIarch, and imme- diately commercial men prepared to reap the advantages caused by them. Among the national branches of industry destined to profit met largely by the benefits of the treaty of the 2!3d of January, lfiJ, must be mentioned in the first
			notheowineotrade and the fanry articles of Paris. The wnes and spiits of our southorn departments, which are so highly esteemed, bad formerly such exorbitant duties im- posed on them in the United Kingdom that the sale of them was exceedingly restricted. Commerce now sees that under a moderate system of dutles tho markset must be enlarged ; and, consequently in our southern departments-at Bor- deaux and at La itochelle-conslderable ordera have already been received, and have even begun to be executed. The immense colection of the moat varied and the most inge- nious mannfactures, caUed the Parisian trade, has also received an impetus. To what extent are Parisian manu- factures favoured by the recent commercialstipulations? An examination of the table of exemptions and reductions effected bv the treaty on those manufactures will
			show, but ive wil cite some examples. Heretofore jewelry only entered England on paying a duty of 10 per cent., but nowit is exempt. Works m bronze paid 24f. 60c.the100 kilo- grammes, bat they are now free from all duty. Hats of bark, cane, hair, or straw did not pay less than 6f. S9c. the kilo- gramme, and other bats lf. 2Sc. each; but now admission to the United Kingdom Is freely opened to them alL Wrought leather, sach as %oots, shoes, &amp;Ac., were subjected to duties varying from 5f. 62M. to 9f. 37c. the dozen pair; but now they are free. ArtificiL flowers paid a duty of 50L. 40c. the decistcre (something more than two cubic feet square), and now they pay nothing. Women's bonnets, which paid 37t. 50c. each, and womeu's dresses 37f. 50c. each, are also exempt We have no need to continue this enumeration. The above-cited example3 saffice to show the extent of the faciitIes accorded to articles of Paris make. The sak mann- factare is not less favoured-tissues, velvets, and ribands, which paid considerable duties, enjoy a complete immunity. The Importance of the exportation of these articles, which has already commenced, may he shown by official figulres. A t the Cllstom-honasao Paris a return of the ordinary ex:- ports and of the exports with drawback for five cerrespond. mng days of tho month of Marchl of the years 18S9 and 1880 has been drawn up, the ordinary exports aomprising the generalUty of articles of Parls. It appears from this return that while goods exported with drawback present only a small Increase in 1860 compared with 1859,-the sum re- ceIved being 2,169,000!. Instead of 2,0S3,O000E-&amp;e ordinary exports, consisting, we repeat, chiefly of articles of Paris, have risenfrom 2,716,000f. to 3,31S,000f., an Increase of 600,000?. This augmentation, realized in five days, Is a proof worthy of remark of the advantag,es which the Treaty with EAnglcnd ha aiready secured to Parislan manufac. torssY

			THEBS B?72AON COLLIERY EXPLOSIOZ.
			NEWOASTLE-ON-TYNE, Arm 5.
			The inquest on tho bodies of the men kllUed at Berradon Colliery ws resmmed this morning In 'he viUlage chapel. There was a large attendance of viewers and pitmen, yr. Phillipson appeared for the owner of the coUiery, MIr. W1 L. Harle for the Government, and Mr. Blackwell, barister, for the relatives of the deceased. Mr. Dann and Mir. At- kinson, Government inspectors, wera also present. Before the proceedings commenced the coroner gave the anuience fair notice that, as long as they conducted themselves with propriety they should remain, but if there was any cheering or hissing, as on the day beFore, he would ^lear the court.
			Mrr. Thomas B3. Foster, viewer, was recalled, and further examined by Mr. Harle.-1r. Fester said that alU the doors were closed when they measured the pit, and 42,000 feet of air were taken. The air would not retulrn by the shorter way. The air was two and a-half seconds in travelling 50 feet. Mr. Foster went into a detail of measurements he had made In the pit. He said that there was some discrepancy between the imgoog air and the return air, which he ac- counted for by the fast that the stoppings and crossings had been so shattered by the explosion that the air leaked through them. It w ould be months beFore the pit was restored to the condition that it was in onthe 2dof MFarch, beFore the explosion. In his opimion, enpposlgthat the middle broken wastroubled with gas, it would not canoe the far hank broken to be fonl, by reason of the regulator belng there. He believed that tho fall in tho return behind M-addox's Board had ncnnrnnA
			Derore coe explosion, because the tall-end of it wras covered with dust. He did not believe that it was caused by the second explosion. In answer to Mr. Blackweli, Mr. Foster sald that there was a good ventilaton In Haswell Coiery, though 96 persons were klled there some years ago. The accl- dent at HasweU was caused bye safety-lamp. Theventiation was as good as at Borradon. The explosion took place in the pillar working there, so they saw that thero was tho same danger with lamps as with candles. This explosion would cost Mr. Bower, the owner, a large sum of money. Splitting the air in the pit might ho carried to excess. That w.as not so at Burraden.
			By the Coroner.-Had many colUeries in his charge. Falls occur in every one of them. No human agency can prevent fais of stone.
			Mr. llrkley, the overman, was recalled, and oxamined by Mr. HARLS. He said that they had been troubled with " styth" in the far bank broken. The far bank broken was not unusualy troubled with styth on the morning of the explosion. The regulator on the far back broken door was wide open. The deputy informed him that it was not more than ordinarily troubled with styth that day.
			Mr. James Mather, of Sonth Shields, who, acting on be. half of the relatives of the deceased, had, in company of the Government Inspectors and others, made several examina- tions of the pit since the explosion, was called by Mr. Blackwell, and produced a written report. The coroner in the most positive manner refused to receive the report, and another of those scenes which have repeatedly occnrred took place, Mr. Harle and Mr. Blackeell urging that the report should he read, and the coroner and MIr. Philipson opposing it. Ul;timately Mr. blather agreed to give eVsD tsoce testimony.
			MIr. blather said that in 1S32 there WaS a terrible explo- sion and loss of life in St. Heldo's Colliery, South Shields Fifty-two persons were kiled by it. In consequence of his former University etudies, he went down the pit to attend to the men below brought out alive and, arisino out of tho accident, a committee was formed in South Shields to in- vestigate into the causes of explosions in collieries. He was one of the secretaries of that commttbee, and was occupied three years in investigating iota the causes of accidents in mines. He waus examined before a committee of the House of Lords, elnd he received the thanks of the committee for the evidence given on that occasion. He (Mr. Mather) was asked by the pitmen and relatives of the persons klled at Burradon to examine Burradon mine. He went down the pit. The first day he went down -was the Thursday after the e-plo- slon. The pit was then foul. The second day he went down was the 22d of March. the last the 2d of ApriL On the 22d of March be, accompanied by MIr. Dunn and Mr. Atkinson, the Government Inspectors, and other gentle- men, examined the pit. The correct measurement of the air was considered the most important; and Mr. Mather entered into a long detail of the measurements he and the other gentlemen made, and the experiments they tried with the air currents in various parts of the plt. He went down the spcast shaft. Tho reason why he went down the upcast shaft was to increase the temperature in it, as it is the main-sprlng of aU the operations, and to settle a dis- puted point in ventilation. He found the temperatnte at 40 fathoms down 120 deg.; at 70 fathoms down it was 135 deg., and finding it tolerably hot the man that accom- panied him thoughtf that It would go and he would go too, and he left him. There has been some miomnderstanding among the viewers as to the powers of a furnace. Some- times the more a furnace is driven a less proportion of air is produced, owing to the drag of the mine. In examining the pit and In passing un to a narrow board at the middle end, "Mother-gate," he and some other persons heard the gas distinctly passlng from the backs or crevices of the coal. They also observed gas comiug off at "a nicker." After a consultation the lamps were unlocked, the gaugeunscrewed, andthe naked light applied. They had an immediate explosion. The space that this explosion filled was 3 feet long and 9 inches wide, and about 3i mches deep. This experiment was more than once repeated. From each side of this " nicking," where the explosion took plaoe, they had seven beautiful gaslights burning, and they continued to burn. They were " dadded" out with caps several times, znd in the last experiment he calculated that in a quarter of a minute by a stop watch there were 972 cubic inches of explosive mixture evolved. He desired those in charge to take him down the north return, aud they went to Maddox's board hod passed it He went there to see the edge o' the north goof. Four pillars down from Maddox's board, in the headways to- ward the goat, eight or ten yards in, they found the gas standing like a wall. Upon application of the lamps the gas exploded twice in the lamps. Two pillars further they passed again towards the goaf. About 27 yards from the east incline their lamps were exploded out.
			By Mr. Harle.-He thought that there was too little air and too much gas in the pit. That was the causeof the ex- plosion. He found from 50 to G0 acres of coal workings in the south-eastern district, and a goof of 22 acres filed to the throat with gas, and a goaf of four acres in the same condiion as the other. He found by other measurements that only 16,000 cubic feet of air per minute went into these workings. He found the air so slack In the cast workings, and so little passing down the dangerous part of the mine in front of the 22-acre goof, dther to dilute the sos when It
			preEentea iseas, or to sweep it away by its force. 'The wealkess of the air down this return enabled the gas, by its own natural force, to creep up Into the coal workings. They found gas sO near those workings that on the fall of stone or of the barometer the gas would flow freely into the higher workings, and falling there would explode at the first naked light; end sO else the small qu,antity of air passing into the fourr-acre gee! would leave the natural force of the gas to present it- self in the surrounding parts; and, again, the stoppings which were said by some of the wituesses to be imper- fect would allow the gas to spread into the waste and upper workings, making foul a large portion of that district between the first east indine and the middle. Hence, he would say, the camse of the two ex- plosions. If the mine were in the same state as he hd seen it, it might produce the same result at any hour now. With the same cause for an explosion now in existence, they had less power in the mine to resist. Ho wonud not have allowed naked lights to be used at Maddox's board if he had been in charge of the pit on tho 2d of March. He beleved that the ventilation was imperfect on the 2d of March, but there was an assist- ing cause, there was a fall of stone so far down the north retuin that to a certain extent it wonld impede such air as was passing down at that return, and, probably, as the passage was not closed entirely, the gas from the large goal, no longer guarded, would pass freely into Mfaddox's and the adjoining boards. At the same time these hoards having a less and almost stagnant supply of air, gas would bo mado and supplied from the whale coal workinus, acquiring such force as to make it fire at the naked oanAlies. -This, in his opinion, was the cause of the first explosion. Heiferred from the direction of the fire that the 4A-asre goas was heavUy charged, and that the expansion of the air in the exploded parts would drive the gas into the east wholo ooal workings, and the concussion of the air probably would dscharge the gas, first by expansion, and then by com- pression among the workings, and it woulSd fire at the men coming out wi-th the naked lights.
			The inquest has been fulrther adjourned until Wednesday next. Twe more men, mnaking foutr in all, have died from the effects of injuries suistained by the holler explosion at Seaten Burn CoUllery on Monday.

			DEATr ix = STBETTs.-Three deaths in the streets or public places havo been recorded this week. Upwards of 300 occur annually. There is no lack of hospi. tals and workhouses in this great city. Beds there aro ix scores awaiting the limbs of these half-frozen creatures empty beds by dozens in hospital wards, and in workhouse 'wards, with warm fires, fat nurses, funds for food, and
			cltigtoo. All this is provided by the benevolent for the misera1b1 vagrants of London. Bnut there is a certai stiffness about the regulations nnder -which these bounties are dispensed which hlnders their a&amp;pt&amp;. tion to the cases of the very miserable and the very destitute. Hospitals and workhouses need to bo touched with a more democratic and Catholic tolerance of extreme poverty and misery. Foelow an un- happy wanderer in London, stricken with disease, without a son In the world, and it is no. acult to see how and why he should dle in the streets. It is e3sv. also. to see boc &amp;h,
			rules which dismisshm to that horrible fate Maybe amended In tne interests of humanity. You may watch such an un- happy sufferer stumble up the hospital steps, and, after somo waiting, obtain an audience of the dresser or houee sargeon. Be has no letter and cannot be relieved without suEc an offlcial recommendation of a governor; or, by a liberal interPretatiOn, he is admitted to share the benefits of the charity as :a caslty." But, as he sufers from no sadden accident or acute disease, these benefits are con- inaed to a bottle of medicine. With this in his pocket he wnders forthagain into the street, and, tossedaboutfrom relieving officer to workhouse porter, fails even here to dfid a harbour of rest; for, shame to say, oaly a fewr of oar workhonses possess casal vards for the poor. Unless the miserable applicant can establish acme legal claim by resi- dence or blrth, he is apt to be driven again into the streets. And there he may die; there, now and again, mxany actually die. The stones cry out ag t so tiluman and inelastic a syst&gt;em. Let allthe workhouses be compelled to provine casunal wards ; let the governors adopt, partially at least, the free system, and keep always a corner for the sick; and houseles3. Letnus resolve to have no more deaths in the streets.-Lanest.
			THE FsGET FOR TBE CHAM?IONSEsP.-Artices oE tbhe pesos have been exhibited before the Warwickshfre magistrates against Sayers and Heenan, the chief constable having receised information which led him to sulppOse thawt it was fntended that the fight betwreen themwould take ulace on the borders of that ouanty.

			THE GREAT EASTBRN.
			Tne third generation of shareholders, if we may so term those who have taken the preference shares In this nndertaking, are about to uEe their best endeavours to at last render the Great Eastern really fit for sea. During "the winter of their discon- tent' the most extravagant stories were in dcrcula- tion as to the total unfitness of tne vessel for ocean mavigation of any kind. According to these, the 'whole ship, from keel to truck, had something wrong with it; decks, huLl, engines, and cabins either required repair, or were in such a miserable Etate of dilapidation as to he beyond it. When to these fears were added the well-known deficiencies of some of the fittings under the late contracts, and the notorious disunion of the late board of directors, it will need little else to explain the hopeless state of despondency with which the Great Eastern was re- garded. A failure was predicted which would involve as total aloss to all concerned as that which has ever- taken the shareholders in the unfortunate Atlantic Telegraph. For these extreme opinions, however, we are glad to say no real foundation exists. The now board of directors have begun an energetic rule, the first great object of which is to render the vessel as complete in her internal fittings as care or money can make her. The Board of Trade has sent down its officers, and the requirements which they demand before the vessel can receive her passenger certificate are now known, and turn out to be far less than could have been at first anticipated. All these, of course, will be implicitly complied witb, though, as they in- volve work both in the fitting, shipwright's, and en- gineer's departments, they will only be taken in hand in turn, as each of these respective contracts progress-,. The report of the surveyor appointed to *Lnspect what is wanting in shipwgbtswork has also been adopted, and a cont-ract based on its suggestions has alreadv been taken up by Mlr. Langley, and the work begun forthwith.
			tessrs. Penn and Field have made several most minutesurveysof all the engines screw, paddle, and aumxiliary,-and theirsuggestions as toalterations and Improvements will form the basis of another con- tract, which will be issued in a few days to some engineering firm, to which the final and proper completion of aUl the machinery will then be intrusted. Both these contracts will require about two months for their entire comple- Lion, and the whole sum for these, we are in- rormed, is far short of what was originally antici- pat-ed, and is not expected to exceed 20,0001. The ehipwright's contract includes, among many other minor items, the building of new store-rooms, iron etanchions to support the cargo deck, refixing the boat davits, a screw tunnel, additional support to the sides of coal bunkers, and taking out the indiarubber
			packing between the flanges of the iron masts. The latter is one of the positive requirements of the Board of Trade, as the indiarubber was found, during the short trips which the Great Eastern has aready made, to alow an amount of " play" to the mastthatwould certainlybe dangerous in aheavy sea. The Indlarubber will, therefore, be withdrawn, and the space between the flanges filled up with wedges of horabeam, so as to render the mast as rigid as if of one entire piece. These portions of the iron fittings are, no doubt, beautifully made, but it is almost to be regretted, considering the comparatively slight depth into the vessel into which the two masts are stepped, that all of them were not made of wood throughout. Another of the Board of Trade demands is the fit- ting of at least two additional boats of the largest hind. These, though not falling within the pro- vince of Mr. Lungley's contract, are already begun. They will be the largest boats ever carried by any vessel, as they are intended, we believe, to be no feEs than 50 feet long by 13 wide, and nearly seven deep-the dimensions of a 60 or 70- ton cutter. With the engines and machinery generaLly a good many alterations and adjustments will be made, though, thanks to the care which haa been exercised during the past winter by the company's chief engineer, 3Ir. lArLernan, an im. menze amount of improvement in the way of work- Ing details has, it is anticipated, been already ef- fected. Among the most important of the improve-
			ments is that of fitting the main engines, both screw and paddle, with feed pumps. By this change those most objectionable pieces of machinery, the donkey engines, are at once dispensed with as regards supplying the boilers. They will, however, still be kept in the ship as a kind of stand-by, to be used in washing decks, pumping out the bilge, and for fire hose, though henceforth with the main engines they will havo no more to do. As regards the paddle- engines, it is anticipated that by means of an im-
			roved adjustmaent of the slide valves a gain of at 3east a knot an hour may be obtained upon the next trial of speed. Our readers wiUl better understand the nature of their faults when we say that there is ample steam for the engines at fuU work, but the cylinders inhale, bo to apeak, more than they can easily expel afterwards. It thus remains in the way of the down stroke of the piston, and a loss of power is produced by the engines having to overcome the resistance offered by their own steam. BIut, as we have said, bya better adjustment of the slide valves this most important defect may be at once removed, and the change will result in a nominal gain of 500 horse-power. The piston and air-pump rods, which during aU the little coasting trips the Great Eastern has already taken were such a constant source of un- easiness and anxioty, are to be strengthened. The stability of the piston-rods will be increased by lengthening twvo feet the stuffing-boxes into 'which they works and the air-pump rods lwiU be cept from vibrating by spanning them with a sliding socket. The twvo large discs on the main shaft vhich were working very loose can be keyed up to the requisite tightness without much trouble, and, with these and other minor im- provements. no doubt is entertained but that, on the next voyage, very different results both as to speed and the easy working of the paddle engines will be obtained. The most important change necessary in the screw engines is slightly raising the screw shaft, in order to allow the aftermost bearing to be removed. From this bearin- all the patent white metal on which the shaft revolves bas worn out. For this an ordinary gun-metal bearing, faced with lignuem vita', will be substituted; and the shaft, it ia found, can be raised sufficiently from the inside to admit of this alteration with- out much trouble or expense. Tunnels fitted with water-tight doors are to be cut through all the coal bunkers, which are also to be better ventilated, and fitted with thermometer tubes to test the temperature of the fuel at aU times. This latter is an important improvement, and removes one cause for anxiety among those who feared the imminent danger which might arise from an absence of proper means to ascertain at all times that the heat in the bunkers was never exces- sive. The aftermost auxiliary engines will both be fitted with fire hose, and two powerful hand pumps, for the prevention of aU risk from fire, will also be fixed on deck. The united power of all the pumps on board will then be capable of pumping in or out of the vessel between 40 and 50 tons of water per minute. There is no means at present of in- creasing the diameter of the funnels, to aid the draught through the furnaces, but from the gene- rally improved ventilation below, by the new tunnels, and the introduction of a steam blast pipe into aU the chimneys, the deficency in this point will, it is hoped, be almost entirely removed. All the saloons and cabins which were not finished when the vessel left the Thames are now to be completed, and the Internal arrangements, which last year showed such a want of organi7-ation, will he made after the best plans adopted in our great lines of ocean-going steamers. No change can be made in the wooden deck of the vessel, which is much to be regretted, as the planking w-hich was laid down last year is very had. The best has, however, been made of it, and before the lamentable accident which dleprived the company of Captain Harrison's services that able officer had managed to give the deck a better look, and get it, in fact, as clean as such board can ever be. The same remark applies, indeed, to nearly all the other portions of the vessel, which, at the tine of Captain Harrison's death, was in far cleaner and far better order than any one who only sawv the ship when she left the Thames would have believed possible in so short a time. The vessel has now been so long idle in the water that the bottom is exceedingly foul, and during the present spring the stock of weeds already on her is certain to be increased to an extent that, unless removed, must, on the next trip, tell most seriously upon her speed. All the improve- ments whiclh are to be made in the engines will quite fail to counteract this important drawback and, unless the bottom is thoroughly cleansed before startinq, her speed is certain to be less on the next trial than it was last year. Such a falling off, for the sake of a small outlay, should not be allowed on any account, especially as within a few yards of
			her present moorings ar) many admirable places where she might be grounLded vwith safety, and the bottom cleaned and tarred, in the course of a couple of tides.
			According to present zxrangements, she is ex- pected to be ready by the beginning of June to accompany the squadron which takes the Prince of Walen to Canada. She vii, however, it is said, most probably call at Quesnstown for a day before beginning her run to Portland. As yet no one has been appointed to succeed thelate Captain Earrison.

			HOBSE TAMING. I
			TO THE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES.
			Sir,-Having been to-day one of several victims to a gras imposition perpetrated npon the public, I trouble you with tis line, to prevent, if possible, others being simnilarly taken in.
			I was induced by advertisement to take my family to the Alhambra this afternoon to witness the marvellous powers of the celebrated " female horse tamer," Miss Ashton, upon two untamed colts and upon a wild Ennoor pony, " ahybrld between a horse and deer."
			The two untamed colts proved to be half-starved animals requiring a great deal of violent and cruel tugging at with the brldie on the part of Mlss Ashton to try to mak them show any spatL- of animation, which was unsuccessful, and
			in the spacee of about one minute they were beth prostrate, having been strapped up after Mr. Barey's fashlan.
			The hybrid, " the wild Ermoar," proved to be wonder- fully tame, and, beyond having very small legs and feet, evinced no soupfons of venison.
			"'The female horse-tamer" had s0 far no opportunity of displaylng her "marvellous powers," but, from the very rough and very awkward way in which she tackled these unfortunate " untamed animals," it was evident that "marveUouS power" she had none !
			To witness thisImpudentexhibltlon came manyladvez and enUtemen who had paid some their guinea and other more humblevlsitors thelr half-guinea, among whom I beg to subsctibe myself, Sir,
			A DELUDED FELTOW-VICTIM.
			April 5.

			TO THE EDIrOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-I should be very sorry to say anything rude ; but really Lord Ebury is becoming a bore; and not only is he a bore, but, In his zeal for revision, he misrepresents things. In last Monday's service there were only two prayers for the Queen; the mention of Her Maiesty in the Church Mljtant prayer does not constitute that ditinetively a prayer for the Queen. There was no need for the clergyman to have read the Ash Wednesdsy collect at the Com- munlon table; but If he did, what harm 7 If, In men tioning " two supplications for all estates of men," " and two final benedictions," Lord Ebury confounds the prayer for all conditions of men with that other nrayer in the Communion Service which is only for the whoe state of Christ's Church Militant here on earth, and if he calls " The Grace of our Lord," &amp;e., a final benedictlon, he simply does not know what he is writing about. As to the repeated use of the Lord's Prayer, I beg to refer him to the 5th book of Hooisr's Rcclesvstical Polity; and I remain,
			Your obedient servant.

			FIBE AND LOsS oF LD?E.-Early yesterday morn- ing a fire, which vas unhappily attended with fatal results, broko out at 9, Wellington-street Strand, a coffee-house, In the occupation of Mr. Evans. The fire appears to havo orlinated in the lower part of tho house, and thence spread
			Opper stories. The inmates were saved by means of the fire-es0apes, with the exception of one man, James Evans, a relativo of the proprietor of the coffee-house, and who does not appear to have teen roused until it was too late. It was supposed at the time that there was no person in the house, and the fire-escape was oonsoqently removed; hut almost Im- mediately afterwards the unfortunate man appeared for a fewmomentsatthe seoond-floor window, the roombeing enveloped in smoke and flames, which were rushing violently from the window. Finding there were no means of escapo he tossed his arms wildly above his head, and, being probaby nearly suffocated with tho smoke, sank back among the burning mass. This scene, which horrified the bystandrs, 'who were unable to render any assistance, occupied so short
			opried that there was not time to replace the fire-escape. Te flames had by this time attained a perfect mastery over the building, the roof of which shortly afterwards foll in. The efforts of the fire brigade, there being five engines in attendance, were successfEl in saving the adjoinig houses from damage; but the house in question was completely gutted from toD to bottom. The engines continued to play upon the b m ruins until about half-past 4, when the fire was effectnaly got under. The charred remains of the unfortunate sufferer have been removed, and now awalt the coroner's inquest,
			NOEFOLK " TOrBLAND FAr."-Thia great fair, which, as regards sheep, is ono of the most important held in the eastern counties, came off at Norwich on Thursday. SpecdaltrainswererunfromvarIouspotnts,andpouredintothe city a considerable number of visitors from Cambridgeshire, Lincoinshire, Snffolk, and Essex. The weather was fine, and the specious cattle hill,crowned by the venerable castle, was throughout the day an animated and crowded scene. The ehow of sheep was very large, from 15,000 to 20,000 beng peuned, but a clearance was by no means ef- fected, the shortness of keep rendering the farmers slow buyers. The same remark applies to the store cattle offered. There has not been such a bacr spring since 1845, when keep was also very short. Mangold and turnips are almost exhausted; there is notu-n green for the lambs to crOD and flockmasters have to aw lrgely on dry provender and artificial food to maintain their sheep. The short- ness of keep has forced a qusntlty of half-fat stock into the market, and this circumstance has assisted the general tendency to lower prices which has been observable in the locai cattle trade of la to. At Thursday's fir the top price for hoggets wras stated to be SOs. per head. but this was quite an exceptional figure* big and full of condition making generally 3Ss. to 42a; strong and useful, 34s. to 3Ss., middling, 30s. to 34s.; and poor and ordinary, 292s. to 26s, per head,

			BBVISION OF THB LITUEGY'
			TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIDIES,
			Sir,-Your insertion of Lord Eburys letters on the re- vdsion of the Liturgy seems to imply that you are willng to have th Esubject discssed in your columns-at least, I hope I may assume that you will admit a short answer. Lord Ebury went to church, as he informs us, last Monday, and fonud several things which displeased him. There were no proper Psalms, as Lord Ebury thinks there ought to have been. I venture to dlffer from his Lordship. The Psalms are so arranged that the daUy worshippers go through them In a monthly cycle. The question Is whether the order should be disturbed for the sak-e of those persons who only go to church on particulars days. The compUers of the Liturgy have jadged that, except on very special occasions, as, for instance, on Good Friday and Easter-day, the regular cycle of daily redtation should not be interrupted; and I confess I agree with them rather than Lord Ebury. Lord Ebury ought to have mentioned, which he does not, that for the Epistle and Gospel, which do not follow any regular cycle, the Church has ap. pointed largo portions of appropriste Scripture, on Monday last, both from the Old and New Testament.
			Again, Lord Ebbry fancies that the whole service was " a strange jumble of Irrelevance and repetition-the Lord's Prayer three times, three prayers for the Queen, two collects twice over, two supplicatlons for all estates of men, and two final benedictions." But his Lordship must be aware that there were two services. If he was tired at tho end of one of them, he might have departed with God's blessing. But why should he deprive others who have more power of de- votion or endurance of thelr feU portion ?
			There can be no doubt that our usual Snnday morning worship consists of three servioes, whtch were originally separate, but very soon after the Reformation, perhaps Immediately, were used together, for the convenience, no donbt, of persons living at a distance from the church, who would not have been able to attend them all If they had been at different hours.; It is now very geserally ad- mitted that these services may be used separately. In some cbrches there Is a short interval botween them, in order to allow persons to oome or go. Surely, this Is the most convenient, and, so to speak, the fairest arrangement for all parties. If Lord Ebury finds the whole three services too much for him, there Is no compnlsion on him to remaiin tnrough them all. But the large majority of churoh-goers are attached to their old form of worship, and do not wlish to have it altered. Many do not find two hours, or two hours and a half, of varied service at all too much. How could they better employ their time if they went home sooner? I think, therefore, that Lord Ebury and his friends are unreasonable in wishing to deprive their feUow-Churchmen of their fU allowvnce of devotional service because they themselves do not like It, for It Is In their own power to remcdy the inconvenience in their own case, by simply staying for one or two of the services instead

			NOLTH-EASTERN.
			A special meeting of this company was held on Thnr3day t York, to consider a Bill now before Parliament; Mr. Thompson, MY., in the chair.
			The CHAIRMAN stated that the dlrectors had not been able to get the Bills relating to the company further than the second reading, and they would not get into com- mittee tiUl the 19bh inst., when they would go on in due snucession, and they would afterwards be brought before the shareholders for their apFrovrl. With regard to the Bill he had to submit, authoring the proposed bridge over the Onse at York, he thought the bridge would be a great improvement to York, and would give facility to passengers in going to and from the railway station, yet the directors did not think the advantagosto the company would be such as to justify them In subscriblng towards the erection of the bridge. They, however,recommended that the company should give to the corporation of York a small piece of land near the city wall whioh was at present let for 30Z. a-year. and upon which tie approaches would be made. The com- pany would have power to extend their carriage shed towards the rlver, and also to make a road through the city wall, In order to communicate with the company's land, on which are llme and coal depots. The company would be put to no other expense, except placing suitable approach- gates near the present ferry. He moved that the meeting approve the Bil for erecting the bridge.
			hlr. PULLEINE seconded the motion.
			The resolution was carrled unanimously.
			The COAmsm,w said this concluded the business of the meeting, and he was happy to congratulate the shareholders on the Improving appearanoe and prospects of the whole concern.

			A RuNAWAY RAILWAY Eianoi -On Tuesday morning last an engine which had run away from the terminus of the West Cornwall line at Peance was secured at Carn Broa. Tho flight of tho runaway was tele- graphed to Truro, where the officials were on the look-out for its arrival, and consequently delayed the departure of the first morning train from the Newham station. The occur- rence took placo as follows ;-On the arrival of the last train e. Penzance in the evening, the engine is run under a shed, its cole raked out, and drzing the night it Is thoroughly cleaned. In tho mormng some men light the fire of the engine, and thus things are in trim for the driver and stoker at 6 o'clock. On Tuesday morning this pro. cess had taken place at 5 o'clock, and the engine cleaner had retired for a moment. On his return the engine was gone. He had left the regulator open and the break up; the fire had caught quickly, steam rose, and away went the riderless puffer over the wooden viaduct at Chyandour smash through the gates at l-ranion station, slowly up the incline, 60 miles an hour down steep gradients, over many unoccupled crossings, through numerous prirs of stout gates, by St. Ivos read and Hayle, Gwineaz road and Camborne, until its breath was nearly gone. The first of a pair of gates near Pool it opened, the second it tore up and bore along the line on its cow-catcher, until at earn Brea some one saw It coming at an abated speed, with the gate in front, jumped on It, and thus secured the truant- most fortunately not the slightest harm h&amp;vigocomrod
			ercept to the gates aforesaid during its unrestrainedE run of 16 ozr17 miles. An enginewvas sentfrom Penoe in pursuit, but coulduotovertake the runaway, and therefore; returned for the conveyanceoOf the up-tralu,-P?prnouh| Journe?.

			M POVEBTY OP THE CLERGY.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE TriaS.
			Sir,-Months ago you opened your columns to a long correspondence on the insufficient incomes of many of the clergy, and the consequent clerlcal distress. A great talk about the poor clergy ensued all over the country, as there does about everything which is taken up by Thc Times; but, mark you, Sir, nothing ensed but talk. I do not wish to reopen the correspondence ; but, jUst now, that Psariament is not sittng, will you do the poor clergy the good Eervice to find room for only one letter on the subject ?
			I will only ask to remind your readers of one broad fact, that according to officlal documents, the truth of which baa never that I kow been questioned, there are 5,454 old livings, and between 1,000 and 2,000 new dlstrict parishes, the groee nnnnal income of whichfromallsurooes is less than 1501. Im your former corresnondence it came to light that there are two societies-one for giving cast-off clothes, and the other for givlng pecuniary alms to poor cerg- men in peculiar distress. The we1Dto-do public was very much shocked to hear about thesc two societies. But let me assure them that these societies are only eruptiva symptoms of the disease of clerical poverty, wbich is more widely spread than the public is aware of, so decently de the victims hide their Sores and obey the demand of soclctH that they should keep up the respectability of thar cloth62 The old tale of the Spartan boy who stood and smiled whUoi the fos ws gnmwing his vtals has its prototype in many a smart new district parsonage, and many a pretty oountry vicarage besides.
			sr comrse, Ovevr ooay asOmts that this ought not to be ; nobody disputes that "they who preach the Gospel ongbht
			to live by the Gospel ;" "and that," says Lord Chaneellor Bacon, "in a proportion not small and necessitous, bat plentiful and liberaL." But the practical question is- what is to be done ? I vant to suggest to thosa who ask the question with a real disposition to dqj something, that the Church system is not exclusively- an endowment system. It wisely encourages endowments for the sake of the permanenoe they give ; but it has pro. vided machinery for supplementing inadequate endow- ments. It bids every Incambent once a-year, at Easter, to give his parlshioners the opportunity to fulfil anything which the piety of former ages may have left to them to do, in providlng that he who preachesto them the Gospel shonld live-not starve-of tho gospel. And it puts appro. priate texts among the offertory sentences to show that the people may be properly moved to contlibute to the maintenance of their ministers through this channel also.
			If your well-to-do readers will only take the hint this aster time, they may send comfort into thd hearts and homes of many thousands of those for whom tho laity generally do rea'ly entertain re- spect and kindly feeling. They wi'l enable one poor parson to pay the arrears of his last Christmas bills. and another to send his eldest lad to school, and many thousands of them to go about thelr work with a lighter heart end a freer hand to the poor. Some comfort- able, old-fashioned Churchman, readlng tlhs over his well- furnished breakfast table, may think it wouald be more dig- nlfied to augment the inadequately endowed benefices. Yes; but while the grass grows the steed starves. Lay down an extra field in pasture for him by almeans, but In the meantime give him a truss of hay out of that great stack which you have at your banker's. When the parish clerk comes round in a day or two for the Ester offerings, don't half swear and send out a crown. Don't grumblo and sent a sovereign, but think for a moment to this tune:-" Poor fellow ! born and bred a gentleman; and that quiet lady- like wife too - and these nice-mannered children; and hs living is less titan 1501. a-year; w7hat I give to a junler clerk or a head gardener-* he ought to have 50Dl. at l east; why5 my Income iss - !" ad then sitdovwnand write a check " in a prot rtlen nut small and neaedositus but plentiful
			aud liber. -

			E.L. 0.

			THE RthAxD TGADE AT COOVENTeY.-Great dfs. tress exists among the operativew engaged In the 7iband trade in this city. Sinoo the French treaty was first an. nounced the manufacturers have experienced considerable difficulty In gettlng rld of thedr stoclks d being unable to do so at ordinary prices oeveral have disposed of largo qun. tltes of goods by tender. Not knowing what may bo the ultimate effect of the now arrangements on the trade they aro unwilling to go on manufacturlng, especlr y at the pre. sent prices paid for labour. The consequence Is, that thon. sads have been thrown out of employ, and in those fac. tories which are open the hancds only work half-time. The poor people are thus reduced to a state of extreme detitu. tien. Probably a meeting will be held, w aith D vew to pro v-dinq means for their relHef during tha ensng week

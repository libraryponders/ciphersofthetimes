			It Ls computed that, ninco the foundation of the Charity, about two milions r*erling have been distributed in perstons and donationt to at least 30,000 clergymen, widows. aged single dusnhterm, and children.
			There is probably no other Charity. founded under rimilar cireum- otancee, and cocmendng wvithouh endowvmaent, and sunhistlug from time to Ume upon the voluntary contributions and benefactons of successive generations, which can adduce such large results, proving no leer the necesity for anch a Society and the excellence of its obje;te than the confidenro wbich has ever beco placed in lta management.
			The good effected is not, however, to he measured merely by the amount ot money given away-the enms distributed have in very many cases called forth the assistauce of individuala wbo otherwise might not have contributed at all to the relief of the applicants This more espedally happens in that branch of the foe'tys3 objects which provides funds for the education and pla.ing out In life the children of poor clergymen-au object ffeetiug nmnisxed good, whether viewed In the iamediste relief to the parents, or the u timate benefit to the Socidty.

			OwNQ'UEST and COLONIZATION in NORVH AFRICA, by GROB&amp;{B WrINgBO B COOEB.'S
			Our readers are now opportunelv reminded of the series of letters on Algeria published in The Times some three or four years ago, and of which the authorship is now avowed on the titlepage of this volume. It is difficult to conceive a more appropriate reprint, or a more timely work of information on the bearings of the Spanish invasion of Morocco. Oar readers will recall the sprightly charm of this narrative in its original form, when the author was so impressed by the pecullar prospects of Algeria that he made a political exercise out of a vacation ramble, and converted, of his own accord, a recreation into a study. The writer, Mr. George Wingrove Cooke, has beeu, nevertheless, much longer known by his legal labours than by the literary records of his travels, of which his visit to China is so pre-eoieently popular. He has almost monopoLized, as a law writer, all that legal learning which relates to the great rural reforms of this generation,-tithes, commons, copyholds, and agri- cultural tenancies,-and we believe he has served on most of the chief comnuissions wlhich have practically dealt with these abstruse arrangements. Yet we find that in his case legal discipline has not impaired a natural liveliness, but, on the contrary, has enabled him to turn his poners of observation to the readiest accoumt; and this volume, like the record of Mr. Cooke's visit to China, may be accepted as a proof of his ambidextrous faculty.
			Of course, it is not for us to review a work -which has in the main appeared in our own columns; but we may, nevertheless, endorse the authofs observa- tion as to its practical bearings, by repeating that all ho has said of Algeria is, with some difference of names, true of M5orocco. The fact is, that previous to the letters of our present correspondent from the Spanish quarters, and exclusive of the area to which they refer we knew, and we stil know, very little of the kToorish empire. Barth has been able to inform us of the interior of Soudan, and Livingstone has been able to explore Southern Africa; but no one has been allowed to see and describe Morocco. The Emperor who has so lately died, after a reign of 40 vears, took care that no explorer of his dominions should return alive. The same policy has been pursued by his pre- decessors for 300 years; and when we in- quire as to the condition of this part of Africa we must go back to Leo the African, or gatherthe small pieces of information that have been acquired by European Consuls,-such, for ex- ample, as that recently brought back by our Consul at Rlabat, that the people were fanatics, and that the place was too hot forhim. Thus our best guide up to this date is the analogy which Morocco bears to Algeria with the information which our mastery of the sea gives us of its coasts. It is from these sources, the first more exclusively his own, that Mr. Wingrove Ceoke has compiled the supplement which he now adds to his former letters, and in which the reader wil find much of the most recent French and other information on Morocco itself. Mr. Cooke is evidently intently observant of the present contest, and has his own theories as to its objects and ultimate consequences. The reader for amusement only will be amused, but the poli- tician will find matter of grave interest in MIr. Cooke's statistics and predictions, and may greatly enlarge his conceptions as to the bearings of the Spanish crusade. On the question of^the prudence of railway investments in Algeria-a project recently put before the commercial world-Mr. Cooke thus expresses himself:-
			"I hve, heays" doltponhoitsral commumication of hiscontr, a-J th cot f tanst,because Algeria is loo-jg ernstl t Lndo fr rdepton. Whenever I wasintodued s a EnUslmanthefirt qestonasked was, wetherI was ome dot tevhervu a'frLndon, thythink and say, can d vrtig n there Ia animpresionin Algieria ta as-or and Lombrd-sreethaveat this momen noote hp than that of obtaining concessions frFec al
			wtays. Upon this subject I can say no more than that railways are the very first necessity for the3 development of tho resour-es of this province; that a line which should bring the fertile plains into conmexion with a good harbour would carry down a great deal of corn, andc carry back a gre,at many barrels sod bales,' anLd would have a considerable pa7sesger traffic; but that an Englis-hmaxnimust bo mad who wouldl invest a farthing lin railways through Algeria unuless he is well satisfled with the amount and the security of a G}overnment guiarantee."

			FINANCIAL NOTIOBS OF INDIA.
			TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIThES.
			Sir,-In his three hours' very clever speech ALr. Wilson has faUen into mistakes calculated to excite the wouder of,those who have made India their study. It is clear enough that the zeal of the finan- cier to discover raw materials for taxation is at the bottom of the fallacies into which he has been com- mitted, and therefore it becomes a nublic duty to disabuse him, and this I shall attemnpt to do in the present letter.
			Here is his first delusion: he sees the cities of Calcutta and Delhi, travels over the principal high- way of India for eome 1,200 miles, and, as he him- self saye, has had little more than two months' ex- perience of India. On the faith of this he says of the upper valley of the Ganges, the main escene of the late rebellion, that for populousness and in- dustry he can find no country of Continental Europa to compare, except BeLgium,-Belginm, as he him- sielf says, "on a greatly extended scale." The parallel is the Dure creation of a lively fiscal fancy, and Mr. Wilson wiU find himself alone in drawing it.
			One of the evidences of Indian prosperity adduced by MIr. WVilson is a supposed general rise in the wages of labour, and this was especiaUy urged as a justification of the addition which Mr. Wilson bimself, shortly after his arrival, made in the poll-tax levied through the monopoly in salt. In seven short years' time it was asserted that the wages of labour had been doubled, and even trebled; and the addi- tional irnpost, it was argued, came therefore, in pro- portion to means, to be virtually no increase of tax at all. Wages beyond the ordinary level have always existed where British capital and enterprise have been exercised, and, as they are now exercised to a far greater extent than at any former period, no doubt the sphere of higher wages is greatly extended, but a general rise of wages of 100 and 200 per cent. ia a country everywvhere populous and generaly overpeopled is a thing that never happened in any country, and which is indeod an impo3sibility. If the whole of the 11 milions worth of silver which is now yearly imported into India had been paid as wages, it would not have produced the enhanced rate which is alleged to have taken place in the labour-market of tho 200 millions among whom it would be distributed. The large emigration, con- fined entirely to the working classes, which is takina place yearly to the Eastern Islands, to Ceylon, to the BFauritius, and even to tLe WVest Indies, is proof sufficient that the allegation of a general rise of wages is a pure fiction. In his speech, in- deed, Mr. Wilson himself restricts the double and treble wages to " many districts," and he would have expressed himself more truly had he said " to
			A forW 1f li'1tiaA~2
			But, had a general rise of wages taken place, it would have been counteracted to the poor by the general rise in the price of commodities which BIr. Wilson himself justly adduces as proof of com- mercial prosperity. These embrace nearlv all the necessaries of life-as corn, pulses, and oil. Rice, for example, has nearly ceesed from its high price to be an export of the lower valley of the Ganges, the most populous part of India, and that, too, in which the rise of wages has chiefly prevailed. The cost of salt he has enhanced by his own act; and this, too, in the face of the recommendation of a committee of the House of Commons to reduce it.
			Mr. Wilson furnished statements of the Indian imports and exports to show by the increase which had taken place in them the rapid advance of pros- peritv. In this, however, there is nothing to dis- tinguish India from any other country tolerably civilized, and enjoying a tolerably stable Govern- ment. The external commerce of India is almost wholly the creation of English enterprise and capital, and its recent increase is chiefly owing, as in other countries, to the stimulant of the gold discoveries. In the period of five years immediately preceding these the average annual export of merchandise from India was of the value of 15,675,044., and in the five ending with 1S59 it had risen to 22,187,73G7,- an increase of abDut 40 per cent. On a comparison of the same periods our own home exports had been more than doubled.
			In truth the boaw fidc exports of India are not only not great, bat very small in comparison to its vast population-for this includes not only our ow/n subjeets, hut those of the tributary States, and of sever.al of our independent neighbouLrs. But, even
			from the value of the Indian exports, such as it it
			has to be deducted tho tax on opium, not less than 4,000,000l.,whichis, ofcourse,no more anexport than our own ter and sugar duties are English imporg. MIaking thisindispensablededuction, it wilibe found tathe exports of China in the two articles of tea and raw sil are equal in valne to the entire exports of India in every cornmodity whatsoever, for they amounted in 1S5S to 16,000,000Q. worth.
			M1r. WVilson, no doubt, makes a very imposing exhibition of the Indian external trade when he represents it at 60,000,O0OI. by uniting the exports and imports, and including treasure and opium re- venue, amonnting together to 16,000,0001. It vill not, however, stand examination. We have before us an account of the value of tho trade of three small emporia in the Straits of MIalacca, which are not included in the external trade of the country of the Hindoos, and we find the ioint amount of the exports and imports to be l6,500,0001T, although their popnlation, instead of some 200,000,000, is scarcely more than 200,000. The joint value of our own exports and ir. ports in 1858, not including buUion, was abovo 300,000,0001., or five times the amount of the Indian. Deducting from the Indian trado treasure and opium revenue the English wiUl be found nearly seven times as great.
			Mr. Wilson adduces the diminished value of the landed estates lately brought to public sale for de. fault of land-tax as evidence of the improved condi- tion of the cultivators of the soil." This is a great mistake; it is only evidence of the impraved coD- dition, not of the cultivators of the soil, but of the Zemindars or great proprietors of the soil, and this, too, entirely confined, as he himself, indeed, admits, to the four provinces of the permanently settled, omittingasltogether the area occupied by two-thirds of the whole population of India, a.nd inwhich thera is no lend to sell for arrears of land-ts, seeing that the State has absorbed so much of the rent as tax as to have constituted itself the virtual proprietor.
			Air. Wilson assures us that "every class of the Indian community iain a state of unparalleled p.ros- perit,," not even excepting, I presume, thelcoolies who leave India to escape starvation, and he affirms that TIndia is andv wll remain the lowest taxedl country in the world." The real taxa&gt;tion of India, according to him, is but Is. 4d. a-head, while that of England is 21. 3s., or 32 timaes as much. Now, if an Englishman and a Eindoo were creatures of the same mental and physical attributes, and if ELindos- tan and Britain were in the same condition of mate- rial advancement, the comparison wvould be a fair one, but, as this is notoriouFly not the case, the comparison is only ludicrous for its inappropriate. ness. We might just as well compare the portage power of an Indian donkev with paniers on a bridle-road with that of an English dray-horse in a cart over a macdamized road, or, indeed, the portage of an Indian elephant with that of an Englizh railwav.
			Tho process by which the right hon. gontlemaan arrives at his strange conclusion is carious and instructive. He strikes out of the Indian taxation the opium revenue and the entire land-tax, and, leaving only some 9,000,0001. of what he considere real taxation, he divides this by the Parliamentaxy return of the population, and thus gets his 1Gd. a head. In so far as the opium revenue is concerned, he is quite right, for the tax is not paid by the Hindoos, but chiefly by the Chinese. In regard to the land-tax, he is right, but in theory only, in so far as the settled districts are concerned, in which real landlords alone exist, the fruit of 67 years' abstinence from taxation. This does not include above 3,500,0001. of a tax which forall India exceeds 20,000,0001. ; the major part of the tax isarbitrarily and periodically assessed and collected, and even Mr. Wilson himseHl in the course of his speech denounces it twice over as a more " rack-rent." In truth, it is rather a gradoated capitation-tax on the oceupants of the land than a genuine tax on rent. But the land-tax, of whatever description, is a real tax, for the State has not created the fund from which it is derived, and which without the labout and interest of individuizls never would have come into existence. If the theory be good for exacting a nominal 2s. in the pound in England, it is equally good for taking the whole 20fl., a fiscal doctrine which the noblemen and gentlemen would hardly approve. Three generations back we took 1Ss. in the pounad, and thought ourselves very liberal when we left the remaining 2s. to the proprietor. We now profess to take aboat 14s. only, giving the proDrietor only a periodical lease of his own property, amenable to an additional impost on every improvement. This ar- rangement has ruined many of them, made them disloyal, and the participators or abettors ot mutiny and rebeUion. illr. Wilson proposes to tax the profits only of this class at one-halt the rate of the proprietors of the settled districts, and he admits that " practically very few of them will pay income-tax"-that is, very few of them have incomes of 501. a year. The part of the countrv to which he more especially refers, be it ob- served, is t'ne very cne which he had himself lately seen, and which in industry and populousness he had compared to the plain of Belgium, the most fertile and populou3 spot in Europe.
			It is certain that inM his zeal to discover funds foe taxation, the true cause of the smaU amount of the Indian revenue compared to popuLation has never once occurred to the right hon. Member of the Indian Council. It really lies in the poverty of the people, and the inferiority of their labour as to skill and productiveness as compared, not with thosa of Europeans, but of some other Asiatic races. The last of these causes he will see before his eyes with- out leaving the city of Calcutta, for he will there find a Chinese shoemeker or carpenter earning two and three times the wages of the Hindoo in his own country.
			In illustration of lthe facts now stated, ana with the view of disabusing Mllr. WVilson of his notions of Indian wealt'n and low taxation, I shall give some examples of the productive capacity of some othem Eastern countries. wiich may be fairly compared with our dominions in Hinuvstan. Last year the gross revenue of the Philippines, exclusive of local and municipal taxes, wvas 2,2(JO,()?tI., and de- rived chiefly from the State monoupolies of atimu- lants and potables and a poll-tax. Thereisnoland- tax, and no income from the sale of lands, and no revenue derived from the consumption as in the case of our opium revenue. Tlhe contributors are Chinese and about 4,(000,000 of natives converted to Christianity. The rate of contribution here is lls. a head, while in India, opinm revenue oxcluded, it is only 4s. 4d. In the ratio of the Philippine revenue, that of India ought to be, not 3S,000,00O., but 82,n00,0001.
			The revenue of the Dutch colony of Java, exclu- sive of the mercantile profits, for the Dutch Govern- ment is a trader, is about 3,500,0001., the con- tributors being in nuimber about 11,00l0,000, among whom aro about 100,000 Clhinese. Here, as in India, thare is a land-tax and a salt monopoly, but no revenue paid by strangers. except a small sum on account of certain swallows' nests, paid by the Chinese, as in the case of our opium revenue. The rate of tasation is here Gs. 4d. a head, or 46 per cent, more productive than in India; and, were the Indian revenue as fruitful as that of Java, its amount would be 47,003,0001., or i0,OOO,OOQ. more than it is.
			I will give one more example, which, although on a very small scale, seems to me quite pertinent. The revenue of Singapore, a colony founded hardly 40 years back, was last year, public and municipal, in round numbers, 90,0001., and the contri-. butors about 80, 0Of, the great majority of them Chinese male adults. Tbere is no land-tax and no Customs and no salt-tax. The rate of taxa- tion is 22s. 6d. a head, and no one thinks it burden. some. Were the revenue of India equaUy fraitfU] in proportion to numbers, it would have amounted to 148,W00,0001., or been fourfold as great as it is. This will happen when uindoo3 are as sldlfal and laborious as Chinese, and when life and property aro as secure from oppres5ion, rapine, and extortion in lUindostan as in Singapore, but not sooner. I would recommend Air. Wilson to exercise his well-known skill and inaenuity, not in taxjing tlel Hindoos, but in fitting ithem to bear the burden of taxation.

			ZEOBBY-MAVKE2'ar.doITYINTELLIGENOB.
			Mo1DAY EvxrNusG.
			Although there has been no increawe of political distrust, and the payment of the dividends com- menced this morning, the English funds have been hleavy throughout the day. Consols opened at a decline of au eighth,the firat transactions being at 94$ to i~, and they remained without recovery until late in the afternoon, vhen there was a fractional improvement on the receipt of slightly better prices from Paris. The final quotations were 94i for money, and 914 to Z for the 9th of M3ay. Bank Stock left off at 224.; to 226i3; Reduced and New Three Der Cents., 924 to i; India Stock, 218to 221; India Five per Cents., 10-Q to 105; Rupee Five per Cents., 98 to l,; the Five-and-a-Half per Cents., 104 to i ; India Bonds, 4s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills, 9s. to 12s. premium.
			There was a diminution of pressure in the discount- market to-day, but the quarterly loans from the Bank are now in courae of repayment, and the demand, therefore, is likely to remain active during the greater part of the week.
			In foreign stocks there has been a decline in Wexican on the renewal of the siege of Vera Crxz, and the contradiction of the reported losses and tlght of General Iiramon. After touching 21j, the last quotation was 21A to 22. Turkish Si c per Cents. .ere also flatter, the old loan at 782- to 794, and the new at 61 to l. Brazf ian Scrip left off 4 discount to par.

Certificates, 991.
			The closing price from Paris this afternoon was 69f. 90c., showing a recovery from Saturday's decline.
			The corn-market this morning was without altera- ton.
			There was a small withdrawal of gold (10,0001.) From the Bank to-day for exportation.
			About 60,0001., chiefly in gold, has been sent to Brazil by the ateamer sailing to-day.
			The accounts from California to-day bring no nadltionsl particulars of a precise character regard- ing the wonderful cilver mines lately alleged to have been traced for 38 miles on the north-western fontier of that State. It appears, however, that the excitement regarding them had in no degree diminished, and that they are likely to be made the basis of a new and fraudulent mania, not only for silver mining in general, bat also for a revival of a
			ystem of impostures writh regard to new disco- veries of gold-bearing quartz and qunicksilver. a large nun,ber of persons continuedl to leave San Francisco for the silver distnect,-a dis- tance of abont 300 miles, and the fact of the last ateamer for Panama from that port having taken less gold than usual is attributed to the regular corewof business having been interrupted by this eause. But the Washoe Mines, as the silver de- posits are termed.Eseem likely for the moment to be eclipsed by wild stories of quartz gold in Southern Oregon. A correspondent of the Alta Califomnia,s,- a journall wlhich will be held in sensitive re- collection by English investors in the Agua Fria, 3Werced River, Nouveau MHonde, and other mnining companies af former days,-affirms that the common rock, at a place caUed Jacksonville, pays about 1001. per ton, and the choicer specimens about 4,0001. per ton. The richness, moreover, increases with dlepth. Two persons working about six hours tooL out .0,0001. "The figures," observes the narrator, "m may seem astounding, but they express nothing more than solid fact." Another account, horever, states tbat the excitement is ofbsartng, an that one of the most recent purchasers
			p of aclaim had, on setting to ork, met with only "indiihirenlt success." The probability is that the affair has been mainly concocted by land specu- lators, or with a viewv of checking the departure ofc miners to British Columbia.
			There are twvo Canadian railway companies, whose aggregate capital, chiefly derived from EnOlish shareholders, amounts to nineteen millions sterling. The zirst is the Great Western of Canada, constructed at a cost of 5,160,26071.; the other is the Grand Trunk, whose outlay has been 13,783,90S8. Both bave just hel3 meetings in London, and, as the shares of the Great NVestern are at 37 per cent. dis- count, and those of the Grand Trunk at 64 dis- count, the anxiety of the proprietors was great. [Juhappily in neither case were any assurances con- veyed that could be received with perfect reliance. The Great WesternCom pany have latelybeen obliged to solicit from the Provincial Governmnent anexten- eMon of three years for a debt of 573,6871.; and, after paying interest on this liability, they find themselves without available funds for a dividend, the net profits for the past half-year not leing equal to g per cent. on the share capital. The G8rand Trunk proprietors have not experienced any disappointment with regard to a dividend, because the idea of any early divi- dend in their case has not been entertained. But their uneasiness as to their ultimate prospects has evidently increased. They have a preference capital of7',035,300l. against a share capital of 2,781,6001., and an anuLal interest of 437,1081. must be paid on the former before the ordinary stockholders can receive a shilling. But this is not all, for a further sum of 1,500,0001. mnst be raised by new prefer- ences, which, it may be presumed, must be of a character still more onerous. Even supposing it can be obtained at 10 per cent. we shall then have a total annual preference dermand of 587,1081. Be- hind these liabilities there is a postponed claim of the Government for interest on capital to the amount of 3,111,6001., but this will not be enforced
			ntil profits shall have been realized for the share- holders, and therefore need not be takenintoaccount. lTow, the question is, what is the present experience ofthereceiptsof the line,andtheinferences that may be drawin as to their increase ? From the particulars furnished in the current report it is to he gathered that up to the establishment of an unbroken traffic throughout the entire route by the completion of the Victoria-bridge, in December last, the gross revenue had graiually increased to a sum equal to the rate of about 577,5001. per annum. The working expenses aro not stated, but up to a very recent period they absorbed the greater part of the re- ceipts. Estimating them for the future at only 50 per cent., the available revenue would be 288,7501. to meet 587, 10S!. of preference obligations, leavina, If this state of things should coutinue, 298,358!., to be annually raised and added to the capital on such terms as may be found practicable. There is great difference, however, between a broken and com- plete line, especially where the break involves
			tne crossing ot a wide river, and it has always been contentled that no test of the real capabilities of the Grand Trunlk Railway could be attained until the completion of tho Vic- toria-bridge should open it up for the general traffic in-produce and goods between Europe and the far- west of Canada and the United States. It is from the commencement of the present year, therefore, that the actual data are to be collected. The results of only two mnoniths, .Januiary and February, are now stated, and " they have not realized the expec- tations which had been formed of the immediate effect of this opening." The reason assigned is a .want of roUing stock, buit this dteiciency is to be supplied out of the 1,300),00)1. of fresh capital about to be negzotiated. Consequently, the directors express unabated confidence. " Within a moderate time," they believe, the gross receipts wiU be at the rato of 1,312,5001. per anniium. In that case, allow- ing 50 per cent. for working expenses, there will be 656,2501. for preference and share interest, and the ordinary holders may then hope to get some slight return. Are the directors justifed, how- ever, in the confidence thus announced� The interests at stake are so e aornious, and the disappointments and miscalculations hitherto wit- nessed have been so freqluent that it is an im- perativo duty to seek the best opinions on the matter. " The next few years," it is affirnmed on the authority of the Board, " cannot fail to place all the securities of the company in a very ditTerent position from that in which they now stand." The positivo form of this prediction may induce many investments. It is put not as a matter of hope, but of certainty, and involves, therefore, a grave re- Bponsibility. That there iY room for unbounded hope in Canada no one can deny, and that the growth of population and commerceo on various parts of the American continent has been such that a repetition of it on the line of tho Grand Trunk P1ailway may retrieve all the past difriculties of the undertaking and make them aDpear insignificant 'b likewise to be admitted. The-inquiry, howeever,
			remains, is it desirable to take such a consumma- tion for granted? The Grand Trunk ancd Great Western lines have made arrangerments to avoid the ruinous effects of recdess competition. So far, well. But, supposing tho agreement to be maintained-and this, from English en- perience, is a bold assumption-the battle for the western traffic remains to be fought with the American lines running from New York, and the latter are said to be malkng great pre- parations for it. Therearemanyother, although minor contingencies, that likewvise present serious considerations. Under the circumstances would it not be better to warn the many families whose welfare depends upon these lines, that they must look upon them rather as anxious speculations than as investments which " cannot fail" during the ne.xt few years to increase greatly in vaue? Such an increase is possible, and, many will think, highly probable, but if the probability should not be realized, what wvil be the position of those who have been encouraged to disregard all thought of providing for that fatal result?
			TI , Lima Papers of the 17th of February state that the notice for tenders for stockl of the home debt to be cancelled by the sinking fund to the exteutof 1,74T,000, had resulted in only$1,066,000, being off'ered below par, the prices deman ded ranging from 95 to 99k, leavinrg $01,000 still to be invested.
			The foUowing communications relate to therFrench Treaty *-
			"S3r,-As important commercial transactions aro daily being entered into on the faith of the French Treatv inevi- tably passing into law, I think the following remarks may not be without interest to some of your readers:-
			" Resolutions of the House of Commons regarding the reduction or raising of 'Customs' duties' are customarily, bat not legally, carried into effect before the day after they have passed the House, in order to prevent the trade of the country from being kept in a state of suspense; bht, as these provisional decisions, although intended afterwards to bs converted into Acts of Parliament, after passing through all the stages of legislation, might by some unforeseen circum- stances be roversed by the House of Commons, every trader, before belng allowed to avail himself of the reduction of duty, is bound by heavy penalties to refund eventually any difterence which may subsequently turn out to exist.
			"It should, however, be borne in mind that the reductions necessitated by the Treaty of Commerce are still in this pro- visional stage; the Bill intended Vo give them the force of law (Bill to amend the Laws relating to the Customs) has been printed for the first time as late as the 5th of March, and stands committed for the lGth o. April next. It follows that the treaty may possibly, to all practlcal intents and purposss, be rejected. The address to the Crown agreed upon by the House of Coremons, and, In common parlance, designated as a ratification of the treaty, amounts simply to a vague promise, the fulfiliment of which is obviously de- pendent upon Circumstances.
			"Although I admit that the roversion of theso provi- s.onal decisions would bo resorted to only in raro and ex- treme cases, and that such instances are by no means recent, it is nevertheless equally truc that so long as this proceeding is viewed by c.mmerclal men simplv as a matter of form,' tbey will n,ecessarily remain exposed to the chances of disappointment and loss until the treaty has actllally passed into law.

			"DANIEL A. LANGB. "21, Regent-street, Waterloo-place, April O."
			"Sir,-If an additional article were introduced in the commercial treaty with Francs that " in no case shall the duties to be levied exceed thoese now In forea," it would re- moveanyapprohensionr-which Ibelieve, howevcr,to bequite groundless-of the French Gvornment raising within the limit of the maximum of 25 or 50 per cent. ad volarem duties of a smaller amount, at this moment levied on many articles of British rrodnae or mannfactnre.

			" London Joint-Stock Bank, Princes-street, April 9.

			TRADB REPORT.
			MONXDAY EVENING.
			TALTOW.-Annexed is the weekly circular of Messrs. Colchesters and W'oolner:-The tallow-market has heen very dull throughout the wesk. Towards the close, how- ever, there was rather more inquiry on the spot, and for early delivery, and in this positlon there was less tallow offering. For the end of the year there has been less dis- position to operate, and the price has given way a trifle. From St. Petersburg the price comes steady at 49 s.r. for Auguist delivery, 53 on the spot. The exchange was easier, and was quoted :35d. to 34jd. To-day the market is steady, at 56s. 3d. Y.C. on the spot, 56s. for the month, 5ls. Gd. to 9d. April to June, 5d, to 52s. Od.

			MONEDAY mmm.
			The railway-market continues to show undimi- nished buoyancy, and most of the leading British stocks closed at an advance averaging about A per cent. York and North Midland, South-Eastern, and Great Northern have been in greatest demand. The final prices were again the best of the day. At 4 o'clock London and North-Western was quoted 99i to i.; Midland, 118f to I; Lancashire and Yorkshire, 1041 to 105 e Great Western, 69. to s; South-Eastern, 83} to 8g; Great Northern, 113 to 111; Caledonian, 141to ; and Eastern Counties, 55 to l. In the colonial-market Grand Trunk of Canada stock is flatter, at 35? to 4, whlle Indian guaranteed descriptions were firm. The only change of importance in foreign shares was a decline in Pernambuco to 14 to 1; dis.; Bahia closed i dis. to par; San Paulo, s to 1 dis.; and Lombardo-Vene- tian, l to 8 pm. American railway bonds and shares generaly advanced, especialy those of the
			ichigan Southern, New York Central, New York and Erie,and Pennsylvania Central lines. The trans- actions in mines were unimportant, but in one or two cases there was rather a atronger tendency. City Bank sbares continue to improve. In miscel- laneous descriptions a rise took place in Berlin Waterworks, ElectricTelegraph, and London General Omnibus, and a reduction in Van Diemen's Land. The Canadian loan left off 100l to � bonds, and 1i

			J2he ttal-yearly meeting vas held at Kinross on tho 30th ult. ; Sir Graham Montgomery in the chair.
			The report stated that the revemue was almost the same as for the corresponding half-year, there being an Icrease o n thD passenger traffc and a decres_e on the golds. Since the commencement of the corfunt half-year there had been a considerable increase in the traie generally, and the early opening of the Xnross-sbfre Elilway and the completion o1 the joint station, it was hoped, wotld lead to a trafic arrangement with the Edinburh, Perth, end DTndeeCnllway, whereby the resonrces of the line wocld hb more fully developed and the receipts consdderable atg- mented. It wass heped that when an uninterrupted outlet to the wvest wras obtained, by meanls of the Devon Volley Ilaiiwasy, the tramfo of the line would bc very materially la. creased.

			GRIFAT SOTTTFflEE\ OF DTDTA.
			The report of the directors of this company states that I during the last 12 months they have been actively engaged in forwarding the works, and so much progress has been made as to induce an expectation that the first section of the railway from Negapatamto Trichinopolymay be opened in tho spring of next year. The directors have already forwarded the permanent-way materlals for 50 miles of line, as well as a considerable portion of the materials for the rolling stock. They have contracted for the remainder on favourable terms, and shipped foar locomotive engines. They anticiDate, there- fore, that the whole of the materials required for the con- struction and equipment of the railway wiU have arrlved In India by the end of the present year, Having adopted the system of constracting the railway under the superinteno dence of their own officers, the directors are now enabled to state, as the result of their experience, that the plan adopted has proved in every way satisfactory, beth as regards economy and the substantial character of the work-s.
			Tbe reports which the directors continuze to receive fully, confirm the expectations originally entertained on the sutb. I ject of traffic, all the advantages of which will be secured to Ethe shareholders immediately on the opening of the first section of the Uine. The cost of that section having been. confed to500,0001., instead of i,OOO,OOOl.,as specifiedin the company's Act of Parliament, it has become necessary to introducD a Bill into Parliament for the purpose of enabling the company to exercise the borrowing powers upon the reduced capital. The Bill aiso contains power to convert shares fully paid up into stock.
			The report of Mr. M. W. Carr. the chief engineer, states that the sanctioned line from N;egapatam to Trichinopoly is 78 miles 42 chains in length, and is divided into four sec- tions of nearly equal longth. The line runs through paddy- fields for about 40 miles. These are mainly under water during five months of the year-from September to the end of Janary. The remainder of theline raus throughdry culvivation and waste-the former for about 22 mils, the latter 16 miles, Much of this is also under water during the north-east monsoon, or from the middle of lTovember to the end of January-two and a-half montbs. In order to raise the line above the level of floods it is almost entirely on embankments, and the average height of embankment throughout is about six feet. The only cutting of conse- quence is at Tanjore, where a ridge of hard laterite runs across the course of the line. The greatest depth of this cutting is 27 feet. The gradients of tho line are very light, seldom exceeding 1 in 500, and never more than 1 in 240. The line is one on which the heaviest amount of traffic may be worked with compara- tively light engines. There are eight stations on tho line-three eight miles aparb, two at intervals of nine miles each, one 10 miles, one 14 miles, and one 20 miles. The eapital account to the 31st of December last shows that 185,3S51. had been received, and 120,G261. ex. pended, leaving a balance of 64,7591.

			2ROOP-SHIPS. I
			TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
			Sir,-On the 10th of January last, safled from Green- hithe for Hongkong, the Melbourne screw transport, having on board a number of men of the Medical Staff, together wdth a detachment of the G7th Foot. Tho Noro scarcely
			aesed, defects in the maehinery are discovered; the Liensourno asbroug,htup Inthe Downasfor repairs, and an attempt made dmurig the course of tho week to put her in a seaworthy condition. Whether or not she was i n any w ay fitted for the voyage, the following extracts from letters from an offiicer on hoard will sunSiciently determine:
			TrDop-shlp Mlelbourne, Feb. 17.
			"A sbss oompany keep their conselS very Close. Several times duringsour couree has steam been shut off, In order (as we were led to suppose) that tbe engines might be cleaned, &amp;c, A few days back we had a stoppage o: uome dix ehors, end thIs was soon fgtlosred by another, after which It gradually dawvned upon es how thankful we should be that bursting boUer bead not aB yet blowvn us hito eternity.
			The engines were not propsrly Inspected before starting; indeed. it Is only by patchfng up that our clover engineer has been able to work the saew at all By this last accident, however, hiS Ekill i
			completely bastled, and woe er now bound for RIto Janeiro for re. palr.. . Imuch fear we shall thus reach Hongkong too late for the starting of the expedition."
			" Pilo, Feb. 25.
			"'We erpect to leave thts Thursday or Friday, and to bare a very tedious passage under eanva.'
			Now, Sir, the chapter of accidents in the Crimean war was supposed to have taught us a practical and effective lesson, and yet, if the lives of our troops aro to be im- perilled in such ohips as the Melboumre, and if we are to touch at the Brazlis en Ol 'tfe for Singapore, our education has scarcely been completed.
			I have ventured to submit to you the above, In the hope, if worthy of publication, that it may tend to make our authorities more careful, and our soldiers more secure.
			YoUr obedient servant.
			LIVEPRPOOL COTTos-MAflrET, April 9.-There has been a fair amount of business transacted inL cotton to-day, and the sales reach 8,000 bales-1,500 on speculation and for export. Prices In the buyer's favour.
			THE TEN TMAD, April 9.-The deliveries in London estimated for the week were 76,30,lb., which Is a decreme of 137,7801b., compared with the previous state- ment.

Of country flour there were 1S,9,M sa3C;5 of foreign, 100 bar. rels 60 sacls. Norfolks found a quiet Dlacement at the for. mer quotations, as wall as America' barrels and French sacks. Town prices remained as they were. Of Brl. tlih barley there were 3,211 qrs.; of foreign, 3,197 qrs. The shortness of supply and good inquiry for grlnding rorts brought a further advance of 1s. per qr., those for distillation and maling being full- priced. In malt business was exceedingly dull, with quota- tions unchanged. The whole supply of oatswas 22,7SS qrs., including 2,725 qrs. English, 650 qrs. Scotch, 300 qrs. Irish andl 19,107 qrs. foreign. With somB more vessels up this morning there was a batter show of ship samples tban for sometime past; but free sales were made at unaltered rates for aJl sorts. Of native beans thero were 6t23 qrs., of foreign 1,000 qrs. Business s quiet in all qalities, with. out quotable difference of value. The quantity of English peas was 140 qrs., of foreign 2S qrs. The pr^es of maples were very vfim; dns and boilers found a steady trade. Of linseed there were 9,075 qr arrived and 2,945 exported. But little was doing, and prices of seed and cake remained as they were last week. The seed trade found rather better sales from the advance of the season, red cloverseec. bring. ing quite as much money; white but little inquired for. Trefoil and taxres in moderate request. Canary still dall. Other seeds much s last nnotW.

			THE FATAL POACHLNG AFFrAY AT BEECIIWOOD, HEPRTs.-The investigation of this case by the magistrates, which had been adjourned from Wednesday, was concluded on Saturdry. From the evidence of Mr. W. A. Hubert, a surgeon residing at Market Street, who has made a poet mortem examinatlon of the body, it appears that the death of John Seabrook, the murdered gamokeoper, was caused by a gunshot wound on the right side of the chest, against tho collarbone. The carotid artery, the jugular veins and nerves and part of the windplpe were carried away, so that death must have been instantaneous. Some of the shot dropped into the lower part of the chest, whero it lay loose. In the upper part of the chest Mr. Hebert found a pieco ot Ecorched printed paper which seemed to have been used for wadding. Some important additions wero made to the cvl- dence of John Stringer, whitesmith, of Market Street, frona whom Cane had fetched his gun, which Stringer had had to repair, on the evening before the murder. Since tho first examination of Stringer it haz been discovered that the barrel wvas " out of the stralght," and that part of the rib3 were broken away from the barrel. Stringer coald not say anythig as to the defect in the barrel, but he was quite sare the rlbs were in a sound condition when the gun was taken from him. The prisoner Cane cross-examined Stringer about the new staplo which he (Stringer) bad put on the gun, and which the wit. ness said could not have been broken by fair usage. Wit. ness admitted that Cane said at the tiumethat ho (Cane) did not think- the staple would stand. Cane asserted that the first staple wa3 broken by firlng, and that he tried the second staple soon after he received the gun back from Stringer, and that it gave way. Some rather curlons evi- dence transpired in regard to the prisoner Bliss. A smaIl piece of paper was picked up in the wood near tho scene of the murder. It proved to he the corner of a summons, and had on it, besides some printed words, the letters " ough" in writing. It was supposed to have been part of a summons which had been served upon Bliss about a week previously. Not a great deal of importance was attached to the diny of this paper. Bliss, however, made a statement in regr
			to the summons with which he had been served which in- creases the valuo of the evidence relating to tbh piece of paper. He said that ho was on his way tb Eenpasted on Wednesday week (the day before the murder), in amner to the summona; that he called a, Cane's cottage, and asked them if they could read summonses; that ha gavo the summons to Mrs. Cane, who Ioked at it, and then asked him if he lived at Eoughton; that ho said " No," and that Hougbton had been put on the summons by mistake; and that he received tho summons back from Mrs. Cane, and afterwards burnt It. The probability will at onse be seen that the plece of paper was part of the summons, and that tho written letters " ough WDas part of the word " Hough. ton." The magistrates, having heard the whole of the evi- dence the polioe were prepared vcita comnmitted the prlsoners Cane and Buss for tia at tie next aerxtord As, _s

			LONDON, TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1860.
			We fear that among the numerous and incon- testable virtues of the Spanish nation is not in- cluded the homely faculty of deriving wisdom from experience. The whole history of Spain, from the days of PIimP IL to the present time, is but too clear a proof of this. The bigoted and narmow policy of that dark and auspicious Prince had something in it which captivated the Spanish imagination, and so, though every year added a fresh demonstrai.on of the ruinous effects of commercial )exclusiveness and religious persecution, Pnp IL. au&amp; his policy continued for twfo centuries and a hal' to be tbe idols of the Spanish nation, and even n(AV e -e an influence over the minds of the pee *d the Government which is to fore &gt;ners absolti: t^omprehensible. 'Co keen 7r the Spa.id_s, to exclude as far a- ,-lo foreign intercourse and foreignresidents, to rende. the land as near as possible uninhabitable by any other than a Roman Catholic population, and every now and then to fit out an expedition conceived in the spirit which sent CxAnRLS V. to Tunis or the Duke of MEDTNA SIDONIA to the Orkneys-these are the traditionary notions of statecraft and glory to which the Spanish mind cleaves as firmly in the days of IsABELLA as in the days of PssiE[-in the days of VICTORIA as in those of ELizAsriT. It would be pleasant, if not profitable, were we able to point to one country in Europe which remains perfectly stationary, and brings down into the nineteenth century the feelings and traditions of the middle ages. But, unhappily, this is not wholly so even with Spain. Spain has ceased to be what she was in the days of Pinip IL.-a land of strong and settled government. The CROWN is exposed to perpetual attacks, and that chivalrous honour which inspired the men who led the armies and fleets of Spain, and protected her Generals and Admirals from the slightest suspicion of disloyalty or treason, no longer animates the obscure crowd of Generals who, according to the interest of the moment, defend, menace, or overthrow the throne of their Sove- reign. In Marshal O'DoxsiNr, Count of Lucmr,A and Duke of TErA2;, we have the very type and picture of the modern Spanish General and States- man. Passing over the intrigues of his earlyyears, we find him heading an insurrection against his Sovereign in 1854, and subsequently quelling by armed force the insurrection he had raisedL What is the history of O'DowN has been the history also of most of the military men who have played a conspicuous part in modern Spanish history. A
			strange destiny has so brought it about that O'Dos-
			;3II is called upon to give judgment on the very offence to the commission of which the rise of his own fortune is due, and to give an exact estimate of his own criminality by the manner in which he deals with the criminality of another.
			General ORTEGA, the Governor of the Balearic Isles, has just attempted, and failed, to excite one of those revolutions which give so monotonous an aspect to modem Spanish history. Trusted with an important conunand and a large force, he has broken his faith to his Sovereign, and, in company with the Pretender to the Crown and his brother, landed in Valencia, in order to take ad- vantage of the absence of the Spanish armny in Africa to overthrow the throne of IsA- BELLA II. The attempt has resulted in a dis- astrous failura. The troops refused to second the treason of their General, and OarxoA himself, together with the Count DE MONTEMrOL and his brother, has falen into the hands of the Govern- ment which they sought to overthrow. We are not much used to hear of mercy in civil wars, and certainly not in the civil wars of Spain ; yet we cannot but hope that O'DosN-Nn may be in- duced to respect in the person of General ORTECA a bold though unsuccessful, imitator of his own career. The insurrection failed almost as soon as it commenced, and fortune has declared so entirely on the side of the Spanish Government that we hope it can afford to be moderate. The example3 of successful rebellion do more to stimu- late than punishments can possibly do to deter its repetition ; and, until the sense of public morality rises sufficiently high to prevent suich breaches of military faith, it is vain to seek to put them down by severe punishments, which sanguine and desperate men-and few others would engage in such undertakings-will accept as part of the risk; to be run for a great prize in the lottery of life.
			The capture of the Count DE MoSvTEqoLaK and his brother must be a cause of serious embarrassment to the Government of Queen ISABrLA. We have always thought it au instance of supreme good fortune that the English Government failed to capture the Chevalier CAEsRInS EDWARD after the Battle of Culloden. W.hat could they have done with him? Had they put him to death, his youth, his lineage, and the daring and adventurous nature of his enterprise, would all have pleaded for him, and the blood of a second Royal martyr might possibly have produced a second Restoration. To set him at liberty while the scaffold was yet reeking with the blood of his misguided followers would have been impossible; to have kept him in confinement would have been to provide an object for the worship of the Jaco- bites and the nucleus of future conspiracies. The Prince of ORA.E: foresaw these difficulties when he was at so much pains to expedite the flight of JAm the SECOND as soon as the King was reduced to the position of a mere Pretender to the Crown. The same considerations apply with equal force to the Count DX DIONTEZI5OLIN and his brother, and we can only hope that they will be entertained in a spirit of clemency. Moderation
			befits the strong, and compassion adorns the successful. WVe have remarked that the Spanish nation is not prompt to learn from experience. We trust that the present instance may be an exception. A few months ago the old spirit of romance, which CGEvANrTs was thought wholly to have extinguished, burst out anew with fresh vigour. Spain deter- mined on a new crusade. It was In vain that her real well-wishers pointed out to her the difficulties of the undertaking, the improba- bility of a successful result, and the certainty of a vast expense. Tt was in vain she was reminded that those who stimulated her to the attempt had never been her well-wishers, while those who dissuaded her had shed much blood and thrown away some money in her cause. It was in vain that she was reminded that she had debts to pay, the discharge of which would reflcct more honour on her national character than the most complete victories over a semi-barbarous foe. Spain did not like to be reminded of her debts, of her misfortunes, or of her obligations. Her press devoted all the space it could spare from the abuse of the MIoors to the abuse of the English. We were represented as actuated by tlhe basest motives-envy and fear. We could not bear to see our own exploits eclipsed by the splendour of Spanish victories, and we dreaded, it seems, lest the conquerors of illorocco should once more cap- ture the impregnable rock of Gibraltar. WVe asked for the payment of a debt, and the national indig- nation actually rose so high that in a transport of romance, for which Spain will never be able to forgive herself, she actually paid it. Well, Spain has had her own way, and what has she gained ? After a great deal of hardship and misery, and some very hard fighting, she has marched 15 miles and taken Tetuan, and might, if she had marched a little further, and if she had not made peace instead, have possibly taken Tan- gier-a place which once belonged to England, but which she wisely abandoned as a possession worse than worthless. Spain is to receive 400,000,000 reals as a compensation for the expenses of the war; but sinister rumours are already afloat, AMauritanian faith is proverbially slippery, and a very high insurance would probably be required before any one could be induced to underwrite the risk. The Treaty is received with universal dissatisfaction, and the nation is drinking in their full bitterness the dregs of the cup of disappointment. Meanwhile it is now clear that by this ill-advised expedition the very existence of the Government of the QUEiN was compromised. The plot has failed, but the danger wzs urgent, and a trifle might have decided everything the other -way. The Government of Spain must have other thoughts than castiga'tig friendis whose only fault has been the offering nnpalatable advice. England has no reason Lo be meanly envious of the laurels Spain has gained, nor to be ashamed of the honest counsel which was so churlishly rejected. Spain, it is to be hoped, has become wiser as well as sadder. Crusading is all very well, but the development of the internal resources of a half- peopled and roadless country, the prosperity of finance, and the reservation of national strength for national emergencies, are, we ventura to think, very much better.

			Since the day when King LoUis PHsurrzl threw his crown out of the window England has never been without a sense of danger-first the danger of domestic disturbance, and now that of foreign aggression. This period, extending over 12 years, has been distinguished by a singular mixture of material prosperity and political disquiet. The country is now much richer than in the early days of our QuzE's reign. California and Australia have poured their golden tribute into the treasuries of Europe, Free Trade has given a fresh impetus to enterprise, and every coun- try bears evidence of the spread of mercantile wealth by the new names which it reckons among the possessors of the soiL This country has won great victories both over civilized aud barbarous foes. A feeling of nationality and of a willingnems to make many sacrifices for the public good prevail, among the people beyond all former precedent. In many senses we are better off than of yore. in population, money, and national resources of every kind the country is affluent. Bat it must be acknowledged that these materia;l1 of safety and greatness have not been afforded us an hour too eoon. For twelve years the strain
			on the resources of the State has been continualy increasing, until now even the most sanguine cannot regard the future without disquiet. We are, in fact, in a position which might almost make an impatient man look upon war as a relief. We are haunted perpetually by the apprehension of some outrage to ourselves or our weaker neighbours, which may make it irmpossible for us to remain at peace with honour or safety. We have the spectacle of a successful aspirant to Power wielding the resources of the greatest continental nation, and able to turn an immense army in whatever drection his ambition or caprice may prompt. A fleet not required for the purpose of defence is being constructed in his ports, while the notes of his MIinisters and his own international acts dis- play a cynical disregard for the opinion of Europe. It may be that all this wealth which industry and new discoveries have afforded us-all this enter- prise and commercial activity, wil be diverted from their purpose, and used perforce to provide for the safety of the country. WVe are now paying yearly a sum equal to the interest of 400,000,0001. sterling as an expiation for the restlessness of a neighbouring people. It may be that all that has been gained by the last few years of prosperous labour is to be swallowed up by war or the preparation for war.
			However, national virtue shines forth most in difficulties, and, whatever may be our burdens, we feel sure that our trials wiU eventually result in triumphs. The world has learnt from the Indian revolt what the Englishman, when pressed by danger, is capable of. What the little bands that fought at Delhi and Lucknow were, such are the armies which this country wiU raise whenever the time shaU come. For the rest we must lookl to the industry and perseverauce of the English people. All our fears in this crisis of Europe are financial. That we shall be able to defend our- selves, and aid the cause of justice and nation- ality on the Continent by our example, if we are ever driven to it, we make no doubt; that this wil be done at a frightful expense is, however, equaUy certain ; and we must make up our minds to many years of heavy taxation, thankful that the ciutailment of our enjoyments is the only offering which we have to make to the Mloloch of military ambition whose worship is again established in EuroDe.
			One of our best safeguards both against a foreign enemy and against the crushing expenses which he may cause us is to be found in that free spirit of association which exists nowhere else in this hemisphere. At tho beginning of the period to which we have alluded a volun- teer force was raised in London for the purpose of preserving order from the attacks of a number of misguided men. This is the anniversary of the 10th of April, 1848, when 150,000 special constables, sworn in within a few days, held the streets of London to protect it from the mob. The enemy which then tlhreatened us happily exists no more. It was discontent, the child of hunger, working upon tho poor and ignorant artisan, and increased by the oratory of professional agaitators. Things have now wholly changed. In 1848 liberal legis- lation had already remiovecd a chief cause of periodi- cal distress, and the bounty of HEA,VEN has done the rest. Good harvests, good cotton crops, the gold discoveries, and emigration, have given meat or taken away the mouths. Chartism is dead, killed by the food which has strengthened and invigorated its former votaries. At the present time no cry can be got up even for a moderate Parliamentary Reform, and the ranters who were great men for six weeks in 1848 have wholly sunk out of public notice.
			It may possibly be that the present dangers which threaten us will prove as temporary as the Chartist disturbances of 1848; but the right to hope for the best is only our due when we take the best precautions. The parallel between the special constables of that time and the Volunteer Force which is the present object of national interest is obvious enough. Both are taken from the same social level-the middle classes; both give their services gratuitously; both are composed of that active and hardy race of young men to whom the fatigue of athletic exer- cise is a pleasure, and both are strongly imbued with principles which are Conservative in the best sense of the word; but here the resemblance ends. The Volunteers of a day in 1848 were not called upon to exercise that great virtue-patience. Their time of service came to an end before the excite- ment of joining had passed away. No pains were necessary to fit themselves for their duties; a policeman's staff was their weapon, aud a band for the left arm was their uniform; their most recondite evolution was to walk two- and-two along an alley, and, had they been brought into action, the use of their weapon would have been very simple. The Volunteers of 1860 must go to their work in a far more earnest spirit. They have a more powerful, although a more dis- tant, foe than the half-fed Chartist-a foe directed by heads mnore subtle than poor FEAROIUS O'Co-f NOR'S. To be worthy of the task they have under- taken they must recollect that mere enthusiasm and patriotic feeling will do little without steady perseverance, and that on the field of battle a General would sooner have a position undefended than held by men upon whom he cannot depend. The spring is now come, and the Volunteer Forces of Great Britain have the proper season for drill and practice on a more extended scale. It will be well if the next anniversary of the 10th of April sees the recruits of to-day turned into steady and effective marksmen.

			It seems likely that the complications of the present time wMll be increased by serious disturb- ances in the Kingdom of Naples. It is but a short time since that we called attention to the state of the capital, the terror which everywhere prevailed, the arrests which continually toolk place, and the long lists of banishments which were judged neces- sary for the safety of the Throne. The despatches of the British Representative have fally confirmed everything that came to us from other sources. Unfortunately the young KumN, whose accession was hailed with hope even by a people accustomed to place no trust in Princes, has shown himself weaker, duller, and more unfeeling. than the father he succeeded. The result of stolid and bigoted misgovernment at such a crisis as the pre- sent is now before us. An insurrection has taken place both at Palermo and Messina. The account given by the Government is, that the insurrection at Palermo has been repressed, after an obstinate contest in the streets and the houses; that at Messina still con- tinued. According to news from Naples dated the 8th of April, the insurrection in Sicily still continued, and the Government had been com- pelled to send reinforeements. It would be a piece of affectation were we to express any sym- pathy with what is called "the cause of order," as represented by the Neapolitan Court. Probably the troops will have the best of the contest, and a ruthless slaughter of insurrectionists and citizens will avenge the authority of HMs IAJEsry. The time wvhen foreign States would interfere between Sovereign and subject has now gone by, and the Sicilians, being wiling to trust the chances of a rising, must rely on their own strength and deter- ni-nation. If they be erushed, it will add only one more proof to those recounted by history, that a good cause has no exemption from the chances of fortune and of war. Every
			province of Italy has been before now the scene of furious contests and pitiless proscrintion. Sicily, notably, has waithin the last forty-five years been several times exposed to aU that the vengeance of opposed tyranny could accomplish. We may, however, expect to hear within a few days that rebellion has been put down in blood both at Palermo and Mlessina.
			The Neapolitan Government cannot expect from a people like the Eng"lish anything more than the most ordinary international courtesies. We have no wish to interfere be- tween the KING and his subjects, but we have the right to proclaim that by his recent acts he has placed himself without the pale of our sympathies. The oppression in Naples has been bad enough, but Sicily has been subjected to still harsher treatment. The country which was the last refuge of their race has been treated by the BouRBoNs with an ingratitude for which nothing can now atone. The mainland has no reason to rejoice at the fostering care of the Government, but even the mainland has been happy in comparison with Sicily. The history of the island has been one series of oppressions, producing outbreaks which have been followed by the wildest military excesses. In Naples there is at least a por- tion of the people which is favourable or indif- ferent to the acts of the SOVEREMGX, but in Sicily national feeling has united the inhabitants against the Royal claims. The Neapolitan Government has been rejected by the people as much as that of the GRuND DunE by the Florentines, or that of the PoPp and his Austrian ailies by the citizens of Bologna. Four years ago the Government of the late KiEG was sobad that England end France with- drewr their Mlinisters. The policy of this act has been questioned, but the worst that can be said of it is, that it did not go far enough. The Western Powers showed their weakness when they made a diplomatic move which the KurG was able to disre- gard, and refrained from an interference which he would have been bound to listen to. The error is not likely to be repeated. England, at least, has made up her mind not to meddle with the internal affairs of Italy, except so far as to insure to the Italians ful liberty of managing their own concorns. The outbreak in Sicily wiU cause no exception to be made in this wise policy. The Italians, whether they be Lombards, or Neapolitans, or Sicilians, must work out their own salvation. Whenever a French or Austrian army attempts to coerce them in the choice of a Government, or to reimpose rulers who have been rightly dismissed, the Italians wil find firm and consistent friends in the British Parliament; and with this they must be content. A few years ago this would have been poor consolation. The petty Princes were so strong, the dominion of Austria was so unques- tioned, and France had made so completely common cause with the Papacy, that such moral support as we could offer would have been looked upon as an insult to a suffering race. But, happily, these evil days are at an end. Five Italian Princes bave been deprived of valuable possessions because they have disregarded the just rights of their sub- jects. The Italians have found the way to bring their rulers to reason, and there is no doubt that the King" of NAPLEs may be made to understand the logic which has at length convinced the Emperor of AusTRrA, the PoPE, and the Dukes of TuscA.-v, PARitA., aned MODENA,-that government dces not exist for the mere exaltation and gratifi- cation of a crowned heaid
			The misdeeds of the BouBaoxs in Southern Italy transcend everything that has been com- mitted by any of these unfortunate rulers, the PoPE alone excepted. Austria, though rigid and often crael, had yet notions of good government and civilization. She made railways, and endea- voured to develope the resources of the country as far as was consistent with German rule and the maintenance of supreme military force. The Tus- cans and Parmesans were fairly enough governed, and their rulers fell only because they formed part of the Austrian system, and were content to be vassals when they might have been independent Italian Sovereians. The POPE's deputies permitted the massacres of Bologna, and filled the prisons with men of education, but even they did not venture upon the atrocities which have been committed in the Two Sicilies. Never, perhaps, in his- tory, have a series of Ambassadors from two different States of Europe felt themselves calUed upon to send home year after year letters of com- plaint respecting the scenes they have been com- peled to witness in the capital to which they have been despatched. For more than 15 years the English and French Representatives at Naples have been doing this, and it is a proof that not only in degree, but in kind, the misgovernment of Southern Italy has exceeded everything that has come to light in other provinces. The news which comes to us daily shows that things have not altered for the better since retribution has fallen on the heads of the Central Italian Princes. It is said that at the present moment about 600 Neapolitans are in banishment on the charge or the suspicion of being political malcon- tents. Such doings must bring their speedy punishment, and the example of Sardinia and Central Italy, where a Constitutional Government is being formed, to be worked by a free Italian people, must have its effect throughout the whole Penhisula. It may be that Sicily will not now gain its freedom, but the time cannot be far distant when such a tyranny as that of the BorBoNe-s wiU be as much a thing of the past as The crimes of PHALARIS or Drovsarus.

			It is now more than five years since a report proceeding from the pen of the late Lord MACAU- LAY, and embellished with all tho richness of his diction, described in memorable terms the results which might be anticipated from opening the career of the Indian service to the youth of Britain. Never before had prizes so glorious been offered to competition. Home life, even in its most promis- ing aspects, had nothing to show which could bear comparison with these vistas of opulence and grandeur. College fellowships, Government ap- pointments, commissionerships and clerkships, shrank into insignificance by the side of Indian preferment. In England the prizes were fevr, and the avenues to even moderate success over- crowded with competitors. The Universities offered their endowments of 2001. per annum, and a pros- pect of a College living worth 5001. or 6001. after an interval of perhaps 20 years. What the Church offered our columns have very recently explained. The Army was for those who could spend money, not for those who had to earn it. Turn which way he would, a man saw nothing but hard struggles and scanty chances before him, while in India how different was the prospect I There a man began with assured competence and rose vith certainty to wealth. If he had a talent for adminis- tration, he found a boundless sphere for its exercise. If he coveted power, his authority might be almost despotic. He might be a Proconsul or a Pasha, with his millions of sub- jects, and the privilege of doing infinite good. what attractions could our ordinary professions Dffer by the side of allurements like these? Was it not to be expected that our Inns of Court and Universities would lose their best men, and that the Rlower of our youth would be draughted off for ser- vice in the East ?
			Such were, indeed, the reflections suggested in the minds of most people by Lord MAcAuLAy's report, but the views then formed have not been entirely realized. The terms of the bargain have
			been fulfilled, but the results have not altogether corresponded with the reckoning. The prizes are as rich and as numerous as they were said to be; they have been thrown fairly open to compe- tition; they have been fairlv and trliy adjudged; and they have actually proauced fruits of extra- ordinary value; but the temptation exercised has not been powerful enough, a-nd the Competitors, though of good quality, have been comparatively few in number. MIr. B3lGrT the other day moved for a return of the annual salaries current in the Indiaa service, and the contents of the document are wonderfnL Incomes of thousauds upon thousands ara seductively enumerated through 18 pages, which seem to glisten with gold. Of course, a young writer hardly hopes to become Governor-General with 25,0004 a-year salary, 13,0001. a-year allowances, and 5,000.. for outfit, but if visions of 3,0001. or 5,0001. per annum will content him there are literally scores-we may perhaps say hundreds- of such places. Above all, there are no blanlks. Indian service is not a lottery. Every servant of the Government is so paid, even from the very furst, that a comfortable maintenance is a certainty, and promotion the infallible sequel of good conduct. This is the prospect as exhibited in authentic figures, and we also know that its reality has beeu already proved.
			A short time ago our correspondent at Calcutta sent us a list of the situations now actually held in India by the first batch of successful competitora who went out in 1855. Not one of these was in receipt of less than 480. per annum. Four of them were receiving upwards of 800S., one up-, wards of 1,2001., and the averago salary of each, though the oldest could not be 26 years of age, was very nearly 7001. How long would a man ba in securing such an income at home ? Even this was not the whole of the story. It was remarked that the career of Indian service was now opened in very truth. A1l the old monopolies and " cousinhoocls" had been broken up by the intro- duction of the new system. It was " a fair field " and no favour" for everybody. Mlerit and capacity determined every man's advancement, and the young aspirant was as certain of getting justice from the authorities abroad as from tho examiners at home. We really do not see how such prospects could be improved, and yet it is certain that the offer has not told upon the public with the anticipated effect. The candidates have been good men, and the winners have been worthy of their rewards, having undergone, as was right and fit, a varied and searching exami- nation in a way that would surprise those enemies of competition who cry out because their friends and relations have notoriously failed, from utter ignorance of English spelling or simple arithmetic, to prove themselves fit for a nominated clerkship at home; but among parents and gnardians the popularity of tho service, in spite of all this, is less than might have been expected in times like our own. How are these results to be explained ?
			We believe that, in the first place, the case is still but imperfectly understood, and that the actual advantages of Indian service are but partially com- prehended. In certain families, no doubt, the prize3 of Indian life are well known, but the service has been so long a close service that many people are still in ignorance of all that pertains to it. The struggle for Indian appointments under the old system of nomination and patronage was made a matter of great interest, but it was confined to a limited area. The great majority of fathers of families never dreamt of such a career for their sow, and they scarcely appreciate the truth yet. Then, we fear, the terrible mutiaies of 1857 have done something to mako India unattractive, and, indeed, we know that the wish to escape from the country was very general among Anglo-In- diana themselves after that dreadful convulsion. Perhaps, too, it is fancied that money is no longer to be made in India on the old scale of profit, and that the service has ceased to be Dar- ticularly desirable. We have no doubt, indeed, that these considerations are all exerting their influence, but we can truly say that they ought to be of no real weight in affecting a decision.
			That India will no longer be so rich or tempt- ing a preserve as it formerly was to certain families is perfectly true. No man will in future be able to proceed to those parts rely- ing on his name and connexion for quicl; pre- ferment and lucrative place. This, however, to the public at large is not a loss, but a gain. What the service loses in one way it will gain in another. It is now open to all, and any man may now secure by his own exertions what in times past a few obtained by interest or favour. There are still the same prizes, and they are to be won with the same certainty, but the road lies through merit alone. As to the depreciation of salaries, we have it in plain terms from the latest and most popular of Indian financiers that the expenditure upon the Civil Service is more likely to be increased than diminished. That is Mr. WrisoN's deliberate opinion, so that even modern policy will not inter- fere with the prizes of India. As regards the disposition of the natives, there is, no doubt, a change, but it should be romembered that the change, in some essential respects, is really for the better. That confidence and familiarity of intercourse which old Indians lament was, after all, but a hollow and unreal state of things. The peace which was so pralsed had no existence. Our fellow-countrymen in India were living upon a volcano, and it is no disadvantage, but rather the contrary, that the inevitable erup- tion has now occurred, that we know the worst, and have survived it. We are forearmed and the enemy is disarmed. We have had some pleasing illusions dispelled, but they were illusions only. The faithful attachment on which we relied was a treacherous support, and if we cannot go on trusting as we did we shall be all the safer for our warning. Look again at the advantages follow- ing on modern improvements, and at the ex- tent to which distance is annihilated by rail- ways and telegraphs. India is now close to England, and is daily more identified with it in opinions and usages. Service in the East will be no longer exile when a man can communi- cate with his friends at home in a few hours, and return himself, perhaps, in as many days. It is not without a practical purpoBe that we have offered these observations. Next July as many as eighty appointments in the Civil Service of India will be given away by competition, and the candidates must announce themselves before the 1st of May. We caunot but think that the number of candidates would be greater if the advantages of the opportunity were more widely known. Every one of these vacancies represents an opening which may lead to fortune; every place to be disposed of Wmll insure a competence. The climate may be trying and the scene is distant, but it would be strange if the youth of our enterprisingr classes should be deterred from the pursuit of wealth and honour by drawbaclks which will henceforth be ac- cepted by thousands of their countrymen in the ordinary course of military service.

			SPAIN AND MOROCCO.
			BrAD.QUARTERS CXMP, WEST OF
			TETUAN. MAncu 25.
			:O O
			17T.03I O17P, SPECI.5i. coBB.Es&lt;PO\-EN-r.)
			The most severely contested and, as is has proved, 'che decisive and final action of the Spanish campaign in hIorocco was fought the day hefore yesterday, on g.round a little in front of the camp whence I now write,-at least it commenced a very short distance hence, but extended, a protracted line and stubborn -con9ict, along a large front and to a distance of two- and-a-half leagues from Tetuan. and of two from the further extremity of the pdSs of the Fondach- zvhere, and not so much on this side of it, an im- portant action and a fierce resistance had been ex- pected by the Spaniards. Of the bare facts of what aa occu.red, of the battle, the Moors' courageous de!encie, their final complete defeat, the heavy loss of the Spaniards (larger than has been admitted by officual returns to have been suffered in any other action of this war), of the renewed nego- 'iations, and the final signature of peace by MIarshal O'Donnell and bluley Abbas, you will already have received tidings. The last 60 homrs have been Eo prolific of events, and so much still remains to be ascertained, that I do not expect to be able to do justice to them in the present letter, but merely to give you a general idea of the whole.
			At 4 o'clock on the morning of the 23d inst. the diana sounded in the streets of Tetuan and in the camps in front and rear of the city; tents were struck, mules loaded, arid before 6 the whole Spanish army, between 20,000 and 25,000 strong, was in motion westwards. In Tetuan remained a slender garriron of barely 1,500 men; the three forts neair the sea, known respectively as Mlartin, Custom-house, and Star, were intrusted to the care of a small force of infantry of the line and of a few companies of the Basque contingent, besides the necessary artillerymen for working the guns. It was evident She General-in-Chief expected to have occasion for every man he could muster. The order of march was in parallel columns, and was led by that portion of the first corps which lately came to Tetnan from the lines of Ceuta. These were the same reziments
			Which first landed in Africa, and fought in the aharp action of the 2ath of November, and uow they led the van in the closing fight of the war. They were ei2lht battalions, with two batteries of mountain artillery, and a small body of cavalry, forming a division, com- manded by Lieutenant- General Echague and Major- General Sir Richard La Saussaye. They were fol- lowed by Marshal O'Donnell and his staff, swollen by the presence of a number of foreign officers, most of whom have arrived since the capture of Tetuan, and two or three of whom were slightly wounded in the combat of the 11th inst., or in the far more important action of the day before yester- day. Their tents stand together in head-quarters camp, and that section of it is facetiously deno- minated La ,egionn Etran gere, " the Foreign Legion." There are several Prussians, a Rus- sian, an Austrian, Swedes, and Bavarians, and one Frenchman, Baron Clary. I bave seen it repeatedly atated in print that tbere were British officers at these head-quarters; but that is not the case. The mistake may have arisen from the visits that have occasionally been made to the camp and to Tetuan by officers of Gibraltar garrison, or, more probably, from the fact that an Englishman holding the rank of colonel of cavalry in the Spanish army has served throughout the whole war on O'Donnell's staff, without pay, and at his own charges. The Comte d'Eu, son of the Duke ,e Nemours, a gallant young soldier, and a general favourite, is also still here; and this, I think, com- pletes our list of distinguished foreigners. To return to the order of march. After the staff came the 2d corps, the fighting corps par excellence, under its dash. ing chief Don Jnan Prim, and the 3d corps, under Ros de Olano; then came the baggage, protected in rear by the 1st division of the reserve. The line of march was flanked and protected on the right by the 2d division of the reserve, under General Rios, which moved along the heights-a fortunate pre-
			caution, since it fell in with a large body of Moors hurrying in the contrary direction, with the manifest intention of getting in the rear of the Spaniards. XRios's was probably the strongest division in the field, including, as it did, five-sixths of the Basque contingent, lately arrived. This contingent is 3,000 strong, most of them young soldiers, but all active, hardy fellows, whose flat red caps (the iPyrenean beret) recalled to the minds of many here present the chapelgorris and Carlists of the civil war now 20 years concluded. Distributed among the various divisions went the whole of the mountain artillery (borne on mules), and two batteries of field artillery of four guns each, including the cavalry, which is but a small force-that arm having suffered considerably during the present war. The whole number of combatants is here estimated at fully 25,000, and very probably was not less. Upwards ,f 40,000 rations are now drawn daily for the Spanish army in Africa, which, allowing for the double rations of officers, for muleteers, camel drivers, servants, sick, and all classes of non-combatants, as well as for the small garrisons left in Tetuan and the forts, ought to leave a disposable fighting force of at least the number above stated.
			Tho action commenced at a short league from 'Tetuan; the ground where it terminated, and where the Spaniards encamped, is about Ij league further off. The river Guad el Jelu, or Martin, -hanges its name in more than one place, and at a league and a half from Tetuan, whore it makes an abrupt turn to the right and crosses the road under a bridge, it is known as the Guad el Ras. The road -to Tangier is rather more like a road than the im- perfect tracks which generally bear that name in tbis country. The positions successively held and abandoned by the Moors on the line of advance of the main body of the Spanish army were of an advanta geous nature, a series of hills partially covered with brushwood with here and there adouacr, or hamlet, of 'the poor huts the rural population hereabouts in- habit. To give you a correct detailed account of -the action is scarcely possible, owing to the extent of the ground over which it was fought, and because it was in great measure a colection of desultory combats. The plan of the Moors was evident enough. They are, as you know, but poor tacti- cians, and judging, it may be supposed, of &lt;oft-ers by themselves, they imagined that the Spaniards would advance along the valley with- out guarding the lofty and extensive heights upon their right. Thither, however, General hios betook himself, and soon became aware of the presence of a large force of the enemy, estimated at about 12,000 men. lWhilo that general, making i wide aircuit, checked the advance of this left wing, Echague, Prim, and a small portion of the 3d corps, were fighting their way along the lower ground and over the hils that diversified it. The Most severe conflict was after the passage of the river, where the Moors held very strong positions 'opposito to the Spanish left. Here the army rchanged its front about there quarters to the left, and Prim attacked a vilage in which the Moors had established themselves in great force, and where they made a most obstinate resistance. A 'charge of cavalry directed against it proved, as might have been expected, utterly fruitless, and vsv
			repulsed with a loss of about S0 men and horses. Twlce was the village taken and retaken, until at lsut the Spaniards permanently occupied it. There can be no question that the Moors fought on Friday better than they have ever yet done in this campaign. Their leaders had found means to
			Four hundred millions of reals to be paid to Spain for the expenses of the war; Tetuan to be retained as a guarantee until full payment of the sum, and then to be given up in exchange for a port on tho west coast of Morocco-the port of Santa Cruz, it is said; the territory within the present Spanish lines round Ceuta to be retained; a tract of country round Melilla to be ceoded, its radius to be twice the distance a 24-pounder will carry; a Spanish Consul or diplomatic agent at Fez, or any other place in the empire be may choose to reside at; the mission at Tangier to be maintained, and one to be esta- blished atTetuan; a commercial treaty, placing Spain now and for the future on the footing of the most favoured nation; attacks and outrages upon the persons or property of Spaniards by any of the Kabyles to be revenged by Spain without its caus- ing hostilities or dissension between the Spanish and Moorish Governments. This last stipulation is expected to have the effect of keeping the tribes on their good behaviour, checking Riffian piracies, &amp;c., as soon as these habitual offenders discover that they cannot longer reckon on prote^tion from their own Government against those whom they insult or injure, but that, on the contrary, these will be at liberty to enter their country, inf'ict castigation, and compel atonement. The treaty is to be rati- fied in a month. The Dort on the west coast is said tobe coveted chiefly as a fishing station. The whole treaty, as I need hardly point out, is highly advan- tageous to Spain, and both onerous and humiliating to Morocco. Muley Abbas has been seen by ex- tremely few persons in camp, both his interviews with O'Donnell having been held in front of the Spanish lines; and on Saturday last, as already mentioned, only half a dozen officers of high rank accompanied O'Donnell. I learn, however, from good authority, that when the two chiefs, the Moor and the Christian, issued forth from the tent, the contrast in the expression of their countenances was most striling and remarkable. O'Donnell's large ruddy face was beaming with satisfaction, while Muley Abbas was evidently deeply dejected-as well he might bo at having to subscribe to such terms. Not even a concession made by the Duke of Tetuan could temper the sadness of the unlucky Moor. The sum at first stipulated for the expenses of the war was 500,000,000 of reals (5,000,0001. sterling). This was a heavy pull. "No puede &amp;ond perdonar nada?" said the Prince; "Can you diminish nothing ?" "A hundred millions of
			reals," promptly replied O'Donnell. This was a handsome discount, considering that if abatements had been refused Muley Abbas must have signed for the 500 millions, or have broken off the confer- ence and prepared for the unpleasant meeting at the Fondach previously suggested by his opponent. People who ought to know something on the sub- ject tell me that the 400 millions- wil cover the expense of the war, but will do little more. Consi- dering the lavish way in which everything connected with this war has been carried on I certainly should not think there would be much left when all the bills are paid. The conference over, MIuley Abbas asked for a doctor. One of his hands was swollen and painful in conse- quence of a shot that had entered it some yeasm ago, when out shooting, and which still occasionally annoyed him. Two surgeons were sent for, the Prince was prescribed for, and O'Donnell proffered further attendance if he needed or desired it.
			The interview at an end, General Rios's corps and the Basques marched back to Tetuan, and were shortly afterwards followed by O'Donnell and his staff, who entered the town about 4 o'clock, amid ringing of bells, an artillery salute from the Alcazaba and other batteries, and the rois of the crowd, composed chiefly of Spaniards and Jews. The Commander-in-Chief alighted for a short time at the quarters of General Rdios and then returned a along the aame road by which he had come to the l amp where I commenced this letter, a mile or more
			inspirit them, notwithstanding their many previous defeats, to redeem which they made a desperate effort. Fresh troops had evidently been brought up from remote parts of the empire, The black cavalry w ere there in force, and displayed great Intrepidity. There were several hand-to-hand conflicts, *n which bodies of Mloorish infantry boldly attacked Spat;_-h battalions. In one in- stance a mere handful of men rushed fear- lessly upon the Spanish line, dying upon the bayonets, but not until some of them had actualy penetrated the battalion. WVherever there was a position favourable to the irregular mode of fighting of the MIoors, these stubbornly defended it, and were more than once driven out only at the point of the bayonet. Doubtless, the leaders were for some time in hopes of their fire being responded to by that of the force which had been sent along the heights to get into the Spanish rear, but to which Rios opposed a barrier. Owing to the nature of the ground, and to avoid being himself outflanked by the large body of the enemy he encountered, Rios had to make a very wide circuit, and the Moors, seeing this, attempted to push in between him and the main body of the army, and to turn the flank of the latter. They were repulsed, and after that, as already mentioned, the principal contest was on the left. From ridge to ridae, from one captured position to another, the Spaniards at last came in sight of the Mloorish camps. These were three in number, and great hopes were entertained that, as on the 4th of February, they would become the prize of the victors. But the enemy had profited by ex-
			perience, and no longer entertained a blind confi- dence in their power of successfully defending any position. With extraordinary celerity their camps were raised. It is true that they are not generally encumbered with much baggage, and most of them had probably little to transport beyond their canvas dwellings and a few old clothes and blankets; nevertheless the rapidity of the operation was surprising. A staff officer, who was observing and sketching, assured me that not more than 10 or 12 minutes elapsed from the time when every tent was standing to the moment when the last had disappeared.
			Soon after 4 o'clock aU was over, and nearly the last sbots fired were by the two batteries of field artillery at the dispersed Moorish cavalry. After half-past 4 no more shots were heard, and this is worthy of note, as showing how com- pletely the MIoors must have considered the game up and have felt themselves proportionately disheartened, for in previous actions (except in one or two, when heavy rain seemed to have the effect of rendering their firearms unserviceable) they have invariably, even after they felt themselves beaten, kept up skirmishing until dark. Perbaps, how- ever, on this occasion their leaders desired them to withdraw, for, as a few hours more were to show, they felt that their last stake had been played and lost. The Spanish army encamped on the ground wvhere the Moorish tents had stood, not exactly on the same spot; however, since the leavings of a Moorish encampment are not pleasant to pass the night among. It had been a hard day's work; but fatigue was forgotten in the exultation of victory. There were the usual painful sights and sounds in- separable from every battle, whether won or lost The killed were numerous, the wounded much more so, but the hurts of many of the latter were slight, and at least 200 or 300 were able to walk back to Tetuan, and the next day to the seashore for em- barcation. There was considerable loss of officers, as usnal, in this war. All the commanding officers of Cazadores, light infantry battalions, en- gaged were hit. The heaviest loss (about one- half of the whole) fell upon Prim's corps, which was the most engaged; Echague's troops had nearly 300 killed and wounded, including 3 colonels or lieutenant-colonels and about 30 officers. The official return gives 7 officers and 130 men killed, 97 officers and 1,026 men wounded. General Alcale Galiano, commanding the cavalry, was slightly wonnded. Colonel Jovellar, of the head-quarters staff, received a ball through the arm. The total loss is 1,260 kiUled and wounded, but, as above-men- tioned, a large proportion of the wounds are of little importance, and those who have received them will be able to return to their duty in two or three weeks.
			The army was at two leagues from the Fondach, a large building belonging to the Govermment, placed for the reception of travellera at the further extremity of the defile, to which it gives its name. The plan of the General-in-Chief was to leave behind him the division of Rios and the heavy artillery, and to proceed with the rest of the army by a circuit over one of the lofty ridges through which the formidable defile passes. It was not expected that much opposition would be offered by the broken and dispirited host which had suffered so severely and fled in such dismay. The Fondach passed, the road lay open to Tangier, or to the point of the coast whither the army would need first to repair, to receive, from a fleet of transports which already lay loaded in Cadiz Bay, the necessary provisions and ammunition, as well as the battering train which had been for some time embark- ing at Fort Martin. Not a man in the army doubted of beating the Moors above the Fon- dach, or wherever else they might present them- selves in hostile array, as thoroughly, and probably with far greater ease than on Friday last.
			MiRL.cn 26.
			I have been vriting by scraps and amid many interruptions, and since the above was penned head-quarters have again changed their camp to the old place outside the Puerta de la Reyna, the eastern gate of Tetuan. I resume my narrative of recentevents. At 2p.m. ontheafternoon of Saturday the 24th two envoys from Maley Abbas presented themselves at the Spanish head-quarters of Guad el Rao. They were the same who had often before visited us-the Governors of Tangier and the Riff. The Prince, they said, was most desirous of a con- ference with O'Donnell. The General was little disposed to comply with the request. He appre- hended that such an Interview was not likely to lead to any more satisfactory result than the one that had taken place just a month before, on the 23d of February. He considered it unworthy of MIuley Abbas, as the Emperor's brother and the Generalissimo of the Moorish forces, and of him- self, as the representative of Spain, to waste time in frivolous conversations. If the proposed meeting was for the purpose of bargaining about conditions, hedeclinedit. The envoys were veryurgent. "Then," said O'Donnell, " I have halted here to-day to Eend my wounded to Tetuan and to get up ammu- nition. Since you preSs so much for an interview, this is what I will do. To-morrow, at half-past 4 in the morning the diana wffll sound and the soldiers wil get their coffee. I wiU wait for the Prince until 6; that hour struck, I march." The envoys pressed for half an hour longer; " Wait till half- past 6," they said, Why were they so anxious for so trifling a prolongation ? MIuley Ab- bas, they replied (and the answer revealed a strange and unpleasant state of things), dared not come before it was liht, not from fear of the Christians, but of the Moors, his brother's subjects. LJpon this representation O'DonneU consented to the delay. " TiU to-morrow, then," he said signifi- cantly, "here at half-past 6, or at night in the Fondach." At a-quarter past 6 the next morning up came one of the envoys at a galop, alone, in. quiring the hour. Ee had seen the camp raised, he had heard sUome shots, fired, probably, by stray Kabyles, and he feared hostilities had been resumed. Muley Abbas, he maid, was on his way to the Spanish camp, to sgn conditious of peace. A tent
			was sent oat and pitched at a short distance from camp but far enough to prevent the Moorish Prince from being intruded upon by curious eyes. Some little time eiapsed; when the tent was ready O'Donnell rode down, leaving his staff a few hun- dred yards off,and accompanied only by half-a-dozen generals and an interpreter. Muley Abbas, who had paused at some distance on the other side of the tent, came up with an escort of about 100 horsemen, Moros de Rey, dressed in white haicks and wearing the red fez upon their heads. His im- mediate personal escort consisted of about a dozen old soldiers, with gray or white beards, some of whom appeared 60 or ,0 years old, but all of whom were active and vigorous. The escort was badly mounted. It bore three red banners and a large green one. Muley Abbas himself is a man aparently from 35 to 40 years of age, but he may be more, for it is ex- tremely cdifficult to judge of the age of these people. He is as dark as a MIulatto, and his features incline rather to the negro than to the Arab, although they are by no means displeasing. He is of the middle height and strongly built. He wore a light blue tunic, a red haick, and high boots, with a muslin scarf covering his head and shoulders and bound round his turban with a green cord. His line of march, from his own camp, had been flanked by Mo0orish regulars, doubtless to guard him from the lawless Kabyles, who, scarcely recognizing the Emperor of MIorocco as their Sovereign and greedy of plunder, might have been disposed to make little difference between an Imperial Prince and any other slenderly escorted and well clad traveUer. Muley Abbas, too, has doubtless increased the num- ber of his enemies by the little success he has had in the present war, and by the severe measures he has repeatedly thought it necessary to adopt to en- force the services of the reluctant and to punish the cowardice of fugitives. He is reported to have said that he shall have to cut off many heads to carry out the treaty just made; and whether he did say so or not. there can be little doubt that the fact will come to pass. Decapitation is thought extremely little of in this country, and men's lives are held cheap as dirt. If some of the Moorish generals and chiefs who have been over to this camp on various occasions for purposes of negotiation, with messages from Muley Abbas, &amp;c., speak the truth, it must be almost as hazardous a thing in the Moorish service to run away from an enemy as to await his fiercest and most overpowering onset. One sombre, determined-looking person, a general of cavalry, related one night in Tetuan, while calmly smoking his pipe and sipping his coffiee in the quarters of a Spanish general, that, in one of the actions of this war-I think it was that of the 31st of January-when he saw his troops flying and not to be rallied, his fury became so great that he ap- plied himself diligently to cutting them down, and paused only when his arm was too weary to con- tinue. According to his own estimate he had thus laid low 200 men. This may have been an exaggeration, but there can be little doubt that the remorseless warrior did thus dispose of a large number of his recreant followers. He must have had hard work of it if he cut at their heads, for the MIoorish skulls are said to be remarkably solid. At least, some cavalry who got among them on the 23d inst. declare that their sabres ac- tually rebounded from their shaven pates. They brought them to the ground, but, as for cleaving the bone, it was out of the question.
			The conference between Muley Abbas and O'Donnell lasted nearly two hours, and a treaty of peace was signed. The conditions will, perhaps, reach you by telegraph before this letter, but lest they should not I will state what I understand them to be:-
			to the west of Tetuan, and a short distance from the place where Friday's battle began. On the same evening General O'Donnell's brother left for Madrid by way of Alicante, taking with him the conditions of peace. I need hardly say that everybody here seems delighted at its conclusion, and that there is the utmost impatience to get back to Spain. It is thought probable that the Commander- in-Chief will be summoned to Madrid within a very few days, to receive the applause of his countrymen and the thanks of his sovereign, and to exchange once more the soldier's duty in the field for the more peaceful functions of the Minister. The second in command is Haosde Olano, but it is said that he will go home, and that Prim will remain supreme in Africa, where, if the Kabyles prove troublesome, he is the very man to give a good account of them. Everybody wonders at his having got through the campaign unscathed, On the 23d he was, as usual, in the thick of the fire, and twice he had to throw himself at the head of faltering battalions, and him- self lead them to the charge. His horse was shot, his servant was wounded, but there was not even a scratch for Prim. His little corps of Catalans again suffered terribly. They arrived here on the eve of the action of the 4th of Febru- ary, 410 strong; there now remain 102, after sharing in two actions, in the firat of which their colonel was killed, while in the second the officer who replaced him was wounded. After the fight of the 23d Prim approached the remnant of the little band, and addressed them in terms of warm eulogium. A Catalan himself, he was proud of the honour they had won, while he grieved for the losses they had suffered. He had spoken but a few sentences when, although little used to the melting mood, his voice failed him from emotion. "I will speak to you to-morrow," he said, and turned away. Some of the battalions of the 2d division suffered heavily. That of Navarre, led by a very dashing, headlong Catalan officer, Milans del Bosch, charged repeatedly with the bayonet, and lost 120 men and 14 officers killed and wounded. I do not know its strength on going into action, but most of the battalions of this army are numerically weak, few of them having more than 400 bayonets and some less than 300.
			According to the latest reports General Rios will remain in command at Tetuan. Echague's corps and the first division of the reserve will leave in a day or two for Ceuta. There are general prepara- tions for departure. MIeanwhile alevanter basset in, and if it increases the transports will hardly be able to remain off Fort Martin. Ve had a July heat yesterday, but the thermometer has fallen some 20 degrees, and the weather is dull and cool, with a tendency to rain. We are soon to have a grand parade, followed by a Te Deumn for victory over the infidels, and for the conclusion of peace.

			AMERICA.
			LIVERPOOL, APRIn 9.
			The following is a detail of the advices brought by the Asia, which arrived yesterday, and of those brought by the Cunard screw steamship Etna, Anderson commander, which arrived to-day from New York with one day's later advices, viz., to the 29th ult., but no specie. The screw steamer Circas- sian left New York for St. John's on the same day as the Etna.
			On the 29th ult., at 1030 a.m., the Asia signalled the loyal Mail steamer Arabia, hence, bound west; on the 31st, in lat. 41 N., long. 57 W., passed the American ahip Senator, bound east; on the 5th inst, in lat. 50 N., Iong. 23 W., spoke the bark Anna Augusta, of Nova Scotia, bound west; and on the 8th, at 2 35 a.m., off Tuskar, the Royal MIail steamer America, hence, bound west.
			The Washington correspondence of the Neat YorA- Herald says:-
			" Negotiations in regard to the San Juan affair are pro. gressing slowly. The proposition recently submitted to oer Government by Great Britain, upon a basis which she thought would be acceptable to the Urited States, by yield. ing our zight to the island and fixing the boundary so as to include other portions of Her Majesty's territory which wo do not claim. but which are worthless, was rephled to, and respectft oly but most positively declined. Our clear and undisputead right to the island was reiterated, and, from good authority, I am informed our Government has no idea of yielding one iota of their right to the said island." And also says:-
			" Lord Lyons called at the State Department this morn- ing (27th nlt.) to know whether Government had received despatches from Vera Cras. He was informed that nothing had been received up to this morning, bht they were hourly expecting them. lils Lordship had received advices up to the 11th, but did not communicate their contents."
			The police had succeeded in arresting tho person suspected of having committed the murders on board the oyster sloop E. A. Johnson, and had taken him to New York. The captain's watch, which was taken from the accused, was identified, as were also two bags in which the captain was known to have kept his money. At the preliminary examination which had been commenced the accused, whose name is Albert N. Hficks, was identified as having been the mate on board the vesseL The accused is a native of Foster, Rhode Island, and is 32 years of age. It is stated that his brother, Simon Hicks, was the murderer of Mr. Crossman, at Chepatchet, several years ago; and, after being convicted and sentenced for the crime, he escaped out of prison, and has not been heard of since.
			Information of another probable murder, under almost similar circumstances and with a similar object, bad been received. The victims were sup- posed to be Captain Leete, of the sloop Spray, of Gu cdford, Connecticut, and his brother; and the supposed perptator of the crime is a Chinatan,who was employed on board the veseil as cook. By a most singolar series of coincidences this last tragedy is believed to have occurred at about the same time, and in very nearly the smeolatitude, as the murders onboardtheE. A. Johnson; and,dto maketh analogy complete, the Spray came into collision with the sloop Lucinda, of 1eckaway, Long Island, as the E. a. Johnson did with the schooner John B. Mather. It is supposed that Lowe) the cook, knoming that thereowas moeyaon bard, Murerd lhe captain and his brother, and was engaged in overhaultng the vessol atothe time of the collision. In support of this theory is the statement of the captain of the Lucinda, wvho says that the wrsok of the Spray was littered with bedding, d gs, and furniture, indicat- ing that sh had been ransacked.
			From Boston another Coolie mutiny on board ship had been reported. The ship Norway, of New York, Captain Major, when five days out on the passage from Macao to Havanna, with about 1,000 Coolies, was the scene of a terrible sutiny, in which 30 Coolies were kiled and 90 wounded. 6 the fight lasted from 0 P.m. till daylight the next mTorning, when he Coolies yielded. Captain Major had hois wife and two daughters, and also a ladv passenger and child on board. The lady a passonger died oE fright, and her child expired soon afterwards. The following ac- countof the affair is given in the papers:
			"The Nor;way sailed from Mcao Nlovembor 26 with about 1,000 Coostes on board, and when five days out, at about 0 o'clock In the evenlng, the captpin being below at the time, a mAtiny broke out among the Coolles, who set fire to the ship in two places end endeavoured to force tho hatches. hfr. Stftnpson, of Boston, one of the mates, had charge of the deck, and the w.atch, with tha kcep- tion of the man at the wheel, was aloft taknlg in sil.
			dr. Stibmpson rushed to the hach and commenoed the stsruggle. The crew fromdaoft and thoss below t-led to seize the boats and leave the ship, when the surgeon, an English gentleman, drew hls pistol, and threatened to shoot the first man who dared to make that attempt. The crew then rallied, and went to the assistance of the of ficers, and a fight ensued, which continued from 6 in the evening until after daylight next morning. Thrty of the Coolies were killed, and more than 90 were wolunded before the murtiny was quelled. The captain then gave the Coolies one hour to deliver ulp the armus in their possession; iE they did not, he threatened to cat away the masts, set fire to the ship, take away tho boats and provisions, and leave them to their fate. The r�utineers soon came to terms."
			Uinder date of New Orleans, March 26, wve lhave the following intelligence from MIexico3
			"'The prize steanmersiramon and MIarquis, and sloop of-war Preble, are all anchored opposite the city. The Preble brins 120 ptlsoners, among whom are Commodore Maian d his two SOnS. The prize steamers bring 60 prisoners. The prisoners from the Marcjns weree taken to the parish prison by the United States Marshal. Their tial has been postponed. :Che, Mxican maills of tile 15th,
			Iby the schooner Virginia Antoinetts; are to hand. The military conference agreed upon the teens of an armistice, but the Juares Government disapprovai them be- cause they did not sufliclently guarantee the constitution of 1SD7, which Is the cardinal prndiple of said Government. After three meetings the conference wa dissolved. The garrison reopened fire on the 15th, which was quickly re. turned from Miramon's batteries, two shells burstin, in the Palace. The French fleet was constantly communicating with Miramon, contrary to Juarez's orders, The steamship Arizona is below from Arizona, 24th inst., with $140,000 In specie. A letter from Vera Craz to the Picayune states that Siramon, on the way oown from the capital, imposed a forced loan of $100,000 dolars on the people of Paebla, and $70,000 on those of Jalapa, and, what is more, got the money."
			The following is Lord John Russell's confidential despatch to the British Charg6 d'Affaires in Mexico. It is dated January 26:-
			" Her Majesty's Government would see with satisfactlon an armistice for six months or a year, with the object of convening a National Assembly, fairly elected, which might provide for the future government of the country. Her
			fajiesty's Government does not presume in any mamner to prescribe the form of such Government, but it should be of such a nature as to promise stability and order. With this view the Executive should have a character of permanence, A general amnesty should be decreed, and civil and reli- gious toleration should be proclaimed, because It is only through some concessions by each of the parties to the con- test that the re-establishment of peace can be hoped for. If this advice, offered for the good of Mexico, be not accepted, Her Britannic Majesty's Government will have no other resources than to demand from the two parties repara- tion commensurate with the injuries suffered by British subjects. You will read this despatch, and deposit a copy with the Minister of Relations, communicating it likewise to Captain Aldham, for the Government at Vera Craz, and you wlll take measures to transmit to that officer ali propo- sitions whichthe Central Government may have to make with a diew to an accommodation. This despatch was com- menced before the message of the Presldent of the Unoted States arrived here. The President proposes to depart from the est3blished policy of the United States, with a view of giving the Liberal party, under M1. Juarez, a triumph over the Church party, under General Miramon. But Her Ma. jesty's Government has no hope of seeing peace re-esta- blished by the triumph, through forcible means, of either of the two parties."
			Mliramon replies, that he has maturely reflected on the propositions submitted; that he deeply regrets the unhappy events springing from the civil war, especiaUy in regard to the subjects of friendly nations; he thanks the British Government for its efforts to establish peace in the Republic ; he thinks, with the British Government, that peace cannot be re-established by force of arms; that a road must be opened for negotiation; but that the armistice has its perils in the circumstance that the suspension of hostilities, with a sole view to an armistice giving hope of peace, is not possible while the prinucipal military operations are directed against an important place which cannot be attacked except during a limited season, now about expiring. Be adds
			"Nevertheless, desirous of putting an end, as soon as possible, to the effusion of the blood of my fellow-citizens, I would present to the Government of ML Juarez, if I thought they would be accepted, the following proposi- tions:-
			"1. There shall be established between the Government which I represent and that of Vera Omnz, where and how it may be agreed, relations for arranging a general armistlce between the forces of the two parties thrc.ugh the whole Republic, in order to agree, during the said armistice, on the manner of re-establishing peace in the Republic.
			"2. It is stipulated that in these relations the represents- tives of the great Powers-England, France, Spain, Prassia and the United States of America-shaUl intervene as mcdi- ators.
			"3. The conditions being arranged, and the convention relatlve thereto being ratified by the two Governments, the beUlgerent forces shall suspcnd hostllities throughout the Republic. They wilU be immediately suspended against Vera Cruz by the Government which I represent.
			"4. Neither of the two Governments shaU conclude any treaty with any foreign Power, or ratify any treaty already formed2 w ithout the intervention and consent of the other. This stipulation shall not affcct treates the ratification of which has already been officialily communicated to the Go- vernment with which such treaty may have been concluded, nor those which conform to the formalities prescribed by the laws recognized by the Government which may have ce- brated them on the part of Mexico.
			5. The payment of dues by vessels discharging at Vera Crez, if the Government which I represent decide to open the port, shaU take place conformably with the provisions of the tariff, by remitting the part which should be paid at Mexico to the General Treasury of the natien, m said city, or in draughts drawn in favour of the Ministers of the Treasury.
			"6;G. An assembly composed of the f-rnctionsries who have fiUed high public pests in the Republic from the years 1822 to 1853, shaU elect a provisional President of the Republic, shall fix the basis which the provisional adminis- tration shaU observe, and shaU form the constitution, which shall have no effect till approved by a majority of Mexican citizens."
			The termination of MBiramon's despateh is as fol- lows:-
			"You wil understand, Sr. Captain, the reasons on which the equity and propriety of these propositions a- founded; you will understand the s?irlt controlling the Government which I represent. 'I am, &amp;c.,
			"I GUEL MIRAMON."
			Tlhe Juarez Government, on the Sd, returned Miramon's communication to Captain Aldham, with the declaration that its propositions were absurd and inadmissible.
			Washington letters state that the United States Government had not called upon Spain for explana- tions as to the fitting out of the Miramon steamers at IRavannah.
			The New Orleans Delta of the 22d ult. gives an account of one of the vessels captured off Vera Cruz by the United States frigate Saratoga:-
			"The Marques is not a very prepossessing-looking craft, espeiaUy on board, her decks being still cum- bered 'with the dehris, filth, and confusion created by her recent owners, by her crowded condition, and the confusion incident in her capture, Her capacity we should judge to be about 800 tonnage. She is wel masted and sparred, and has high bulwarks, like ships of war. She has a quarter-deck quite high up from the main deck. Her build and style are Englisb, and we learn that she was built in Canada, whence she was sent to Havannah, and there bought by MiramWons agent. She Is obvlously an old and not very valuable vessel, and only fit for an enterprise in which there was great hazard. She has no equipment, and was entirely unprepared for a conflict. Her only arms were three old English-made cannons, unmounted, one 1S and two 9-pounders. The gun carriages to mount these canmons laynear themon the main deck,in a confused pile withother rubbish. There were, we learn, no smaUl arms on board the Marques when she was captured. There was but one single mark- of the broadside of the Saratoga noticeable on the Marques * a 32-ponnd ball had entered her bulwarks about midshiDs ou the starboard, and passed through the larboard side making a round clear hole, as if it had been cut with a circular saw. In its passage this ball carried off both legs of an unfortnnate American, who, in an evll hour doubtless under the pressure of some desperate stress of fortune, had enlisted in Marin's enterprise. It is re- mark-able that he was the only person on board the Mar- ques who was kUled, and he was the only American in her crew. He bled to death lying on his bunk, which, with his blankets, is still to be seen, saturated with his blood, within a few feet of where he recoived his death wound. The name of this unfortunate man was not known to any on board. His trunk wiU be opened when the United States' Uarshal obtains possession of the ship, in order to obtain some clue to his Identity. The rest of the crew were Spaniards, Mexicans, Germans, and Englishmen. There were 20 of them held as prlsoners in tbe forecastle of the vessel. They were ironed, a rigour which was deemed necessary by the commander, in view of their equality in number with his prize crew. Their aspect was generaUy not very dejected or forlorn, though they certainly are a very mongrel and unfavourable-looking set. The majority of them seemed to be of the very lowest class of Spanish, Portuguese, and Mexican saUors. There were, however, among them two or three melancholy-looklng Germans, who did not seem to relish the discomforts of their lot, nor to manifest an appre- ciation of the society of their swarthy companions from a more southern clime. In contrast with our bold, vigorous, well-fed Jack Tars, this mongrel crew certainly presented a very piratical and degraded aspect."
			Advices from Brownsville to the 23d ult. state that" two companies of Rangers,underColonelFord, and two companies of Federal Cavalry, under Cap- tain Stoneman, crossed the Rio Grande on the I(th into Mexico, in search of Cortinas, who bad re- turned to the frontier. The troops approached the encampment at night, and drove in the pickets and took 30 prisoners, who claimed to belong to a large body of National Guards. They also went in search of Cortinas the next morning, when a large Mexican force appeared and claimed the prisoners as their rear guard. It was afterwards ascertained that these forces had been watching the Americans, and that Cortinas was with them, but escaped at the first alarm. Our troops remained encamped on the Mexican side of the river, above Brownsville, deter- mined to capture Cortinas. MIajor Heintzleman had sent a reinforcement of two companies of artil- leryto them. Three thousand of the Church party's troops were expected on the Rio Grande. It was reported that General Garcia had invited Americans into Mexico."
			From British Columbia we have advices to the 29th of February. Her Majesty's ship Topaze, 50, had reached Esquimalt. The following despatch had been received from the Dnke of Newcastle -
			I Downing-street, Oct. 21, 1859.

			FOREIGN IN=EAGENCE.
			FRANCE.
			[A portion of the following appeared in our seccnd editlon of yesterday:-1
			(FROM OUR OWN COBRSPO?rNDNT.)
			PARIS, S-DAY, APaiL 8, 6 p.m.
			In an article in the Patrie on the insurrections which have taken place almost simnultaneously in Spain and Sicily it is observed,-
			" And, what is more, Is, that well-informed persons pre- tend that these two insurrections proceed from the same centre, and tha' they aro the same instigators which raised the Absolutists in Tortosa and the revolutionists in Palercno.")
			And again,-
			"The event (the insurrection) seemed inexplicable until it was remembered that the British Cabinet had strenuously opposed the expedition of Morocco, and that the greater part of the London journals had predicted that it would bring mtsfortune on Queen Isabella's Government. Hence arose suspicions, which we would wish to believe unjust, or at least exaggerated. It does not become us, without clear proof, to admit ef a Machiavelism so implacble. We rather desire to believe in the honour and probity of Lord John Russell and Lord Palmnerston. But, with respect to the revolutionary movement of the Two Sicilies, it is lmpos. sible for us not to see, as we bave said, excitement oy the part of England. The object is no longer concealed, and there is a party which loudly demands the annexation of Sicily to England. We knew it well when wa siupported. in spite of Its faults, the Neapolitan Govern int. There is no longer anydoubt as to the excitement caused by England at Palermo, and one might almost say that the Sicilian in- surgents are armed with English muskets," &amp;c.
			From the relation in which the Paxrie stands towards the French Home-office, and the fact of its being now or recently under the superior direction of a certain pluralist functionary employed in that department, it might be supposed that this article had an official origin. I am assured, however, that in this instance at least it is not so. It is true, as the PcaCrie reminds us, that it has given us articles in praise of the Neapolitan Government-that is to say, of a Government so execrably bad that the Emperor of the French had to break off relations with it and recall his Ambassador. It is said that Ahese articles are furnished by the Neapolitan Lega- lion in Paris precisely on the same terms as any other r.dame, and they only differ from the ordinary advertisements in this, that the latter are in the ,third or fourth paae, and the former in the column
			here leading articles usually appear, and with a signature. The Patr-ic, which approves the revolt of the Tuscans, is shocked at the rising of the Sici- 3isn; it being, of course, a well-known fact that ihis i3 the first time the Sicilians have shown them- aelves otherwise than happy and contented under their rulers.
			'bhen, again, as to Spain. The English people theught that the Spaniards vrould have done better to settle their quarrel with the 3oors without going to wa&amp;r, and that a wrar of conquest in Africa was Quixotic; consequently, the English are the instig,a tors of the Carlist rebelion. As of Sicily, the Pafrie doubtless believes that this is the first time ::n insurrection, Carlist or revolutionmst, has broken cat .a the Spanish Peninsula; and � :it aU that has bee.; said or written about Spain h.x;ing been the chosen land of Pronimtciamiendos was pure fiction. Who, in truth, has ever heard of an insurrection in Spain? Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston have always been, as every one knows, zealous sup- porters of Carlism, with its indispensable despotism and its Inquisition; and it was to crush every vestige of freedom in Spain since the accession of Queen Isabella to the throno that Englishmen fought and ibled there.
			Falloen as the French press is, in many cases by its own Instinct, in some by the foree of circumstances, itwas difficult to imagine that any journal could ex- hibit such grotesque ignorance of the commonest events as the Patrie does on the disturbances in Sicily and the abortive rising in Spain.
			A private letter from Madrid of the 4th gives some details of the Orteaa revolt, but they con- tain nothing of interest that you are not already ac- quainted with. You are aware that a small band of mounted men, beaded by the brothers lHierros, well kinown Carlistpartisans, appeared about the same time in the province of Burgos. They disappeared, of course, with the failure of Ortega. The brothers
			flierros are the same who arrested the English Am-| bassador, Lord Howden, on his way to Madrid in L855. The "important personages" in the hands of the Spaniards are still supposed tobe the Count deMonte- molin and his brother. Orteaa's arrest is also an- nounced. I should not be surprised if their lives were spared. The Spanish Goverumaent has, I hope, become more mercif ul during the last few years; but there are other reasons for supposing that extremi- ties will not be resorted to. The Queen can haTdly allow her own cousins to be shot, and Ortega's life couid not well be taken if theirs were spared. Ortega, besides, has had the advantage of being for many years an intimato friend of M1adame Montijo, the Emperor's mother-in-law, and the most constant visitor at her house in Madrid. NVe may presume that aU the influence at her command will be em- ployed in his favour.
			General Lamoricicre, on his landing at Ancona from Trieste, inspected the forti6eations and the troops of the garrison. On his arrival at Rome he had an interview with Cardinal Antonelli, and was subsequently introduced to the Pope. The General expressed his opinion that there are suffi- cient materials in the Roman States to form an excellent army, and that he would accept the com- inand wvere permission demanded of the Emperor and granted by him. A telegraphic message was forwarded to Monaignor Sacconi, the Pope's Nuncio at Paris, Instructing him to ask permission of the Emperor for. General Lamoriciere to com- mand the Roman army. The Nuncio did so, and the Emperor, it is said, bas granted permission. The Emperor will, moreover, grant permission to any French officer on half-pay to serve under General Lamoriciere, but not to any on full pay. General LIamoriciere has a special talent for organ- king an army. It was he who organized the Zouaves, Spabis, and other native corps in Algeria, and the Garde 'Mobile in 1848.
			I have received the following letter
			" PESTH, A1RIT 1.
			"This is the day the Viennese Government fixed for putting in force the patent of the 1st September relative to the Protestants; but after the unanimona and energetic protests of the Protestants of Pesth, Presburg, Grosswardein, Temesvar, and I know not how many other important places, that Government will hardly attempt to do zo. In this city, at all events, up to the present moment it has done nothing.
			" Considerable sensation has been caused by a ' warning' having bcen gi-en to MJ. Lonkay, editor of the Idol- Tanuja (Witness of thc Times), the Ultramontane journal esta- blished in this city a few weeks back. The cause of the warning is an article on the Italian question. As an Ultramontane organ the Idok Tanuja was, of course, very favourablo to the Hapsburgs-in fact, it defended with that fierceness which characterizes its party, not only the general policy, hut every act of their Govern- ment ; and yet it is warned. Tle truth is, that there is something so incompatible between the Hapsburglan 2-ceme and anything lik-e free discussion, that even the very organs of the former give offence when they speak in such a way a, to show that they bave an opinion of their own. WVhat makes the warning to the Idok Tanvia more significant is that the article which called it forth Is supposed to have been written by M. Hans, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Szathmar, the only one of his order in Hungary who is a partisan of the Hapsburgs.
			" The Viennese Cabinet Is reduced to great straits to find six men to represent Hungary in its 'reinforced' Council of the Empire. Every toblo of note, and every politlcalmanto whom it has applied, has indignantly refueed his co-opera- tion. In despair it is casting its eyes on men who have meither moral nor political right to speak in any way for Eungary. One of these is M. Marjasy, a well-known per- Eonage in these parts, not popular with his countrymen, becanse after the last revolution he accepted the sad office of trying to prevent the escape into Galicia of the unfor- munato men whose devotion to the national cause had marked them out for the vengeance of the Government. Trwo other people are named as likely to be thrust into the Council-one M. Hajnald, a Catholic Bishop in Transyl. vania; and the other h. Saguna, a Greek Bishop in the name province. They are both so utterly Insignifcant that nobody in this city knows anything about them.
			" The newspaper organs of thc Vlennese Government, both at home and abroad, make cn invariable rule of con. uradicting what I write to you, but a few week-s after they awe invariably obliged to admit its truth. Not long since I
			0old yen that the Government had ordered that six months' taxes should bh paid in advance in Hungary. This was con- tradlcted. It il now, however, admitted to be true by the
			eryjonrnals which disputed it. But,say thohejoruals, there 3E nothing unusual in requiring three, four, orsix months' \:csc to be Paid in advance-that has often been done, and
			the Government has legal power to do it. That the thing has been done is unhappily tree; bhot it ie a deplor;ble error to say that it Is legal, except, indeed, in the sense in which every o'her atrocity is legal in unhappy Austria- that the Government wiMs it. Another statement of mine, to the effect that in Transylvanla a peasant unable to pay the taxes Imposed on him wsc sofZ to a farmer to work out the sum due, was also contradicted. But this, too, Ls now admitted to be true. The admisslon, how- ever, is tempered by the allegation that an old law in Hun- gary allows the W.e of a man who cannot pay his debts. I doubt if such a law ever existed, but, ff it did, it certainly fell into desuetlde centuries back; and the Austrian Government Ls disgraced by having, in the middle of the 19th century, exhumed such a cruel statute, especially as It boasts of having in the conrse of the last ten years substi- tuted the milder laws of Austria for what is calls the bar- barous legislatlon of Hungary."
			There was no improvement in trade, either in Paris or in the departments, during the last week, nor even a favourable symptom. The manufacturers pursue the same prudent system of waiting the course of events. The stock of goods on their hands was never so 7ight, and were buyers to present themselves they would have to pay an increased price; but purchasers are few, everybody feeling it to be his interest not to hurry himself, but to wait to see the effect produced by the Treaty of Com- merce with England. French merchants and manu- facturers are naturally timid in their speculations, and are apprebensive that every change in the routine they have been accustomed to follow will do them injury. Wlhen they do enter on a new specu- I lation it is always with a small capital. In addition
			to the dislike they feel to every change in their usual habits, they are, moreover, intimidated at present by the cloudswhich obscure thepoliticalhorizon. They fear to venture to export their produce to a distance lest their returns should be too long delayed. French merchants consequently require full eecurity, which they do not now enjoy; they apprehend future com- plications, and they look with suspicion on the pacific promises they find in their newspapers. In the meantime, both merchants and manufacturers console themselves with the idea that in consequence of the reduced stock of goods on hand the transi- tion from the prohibitive system to comparative free trade wi7l be much more easily carried into effect without injury to those engaged in commerce. The loss of capital caused by the duties paid on the stock on hand will be insignificant when divided among so many. It is expected, moreover, that the manufacturers will devote their spare time to the improvementof theirmachinery. Having leisuretore- filect they must feel convinced that an import duty of 30 per cent. is more than sufficient to protect them against foreign competition. A joint-stock company proposed to raise 40, OO,O)Of., to be lodged in the Bank of France, for the use of such manufac- turers as might require assistance to improve their machinery, but the Iinister of Commerce refused hia assent to the proposal, reserving to himself the right of acting as the medium for such loans. The Protectionists are now arming themselves to make battle against the proposed rreaty of Navigation between Great Britain and FrqnpA-
			The Paris flour-market was still heavy last week, bakers buying merely enough for their daily con- sumption. Flour of the four marks likewise de- cllned, and the following are the latest quotations: -For the present month 55f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes ; June and July, 57f. 75c. to 6Sf.; August, 59f. to 59f. 25c. These prices, however, are merely nominal, an no sales have been effected. Tho irnmense stock of flour in store at this season of the year has an injurious effect on the market. The factors declared yesterday 2,112 sacks of flour, of which 218 were of first quality, sold for delivery within 30 days at prices varying from 52f. to 5Sf. There were fewer farmers at the Paris corn-market last week than usual, owing to the cattle show at Poissy. Those at market demanded an increase of 50c. and If. the sack for their wheat, but finallv prices did not vary. Farmers are convinced that the price of wheat cannot fall much lower-first, because the last crop wvas deficient in quantity and in- ferior in quality, and,were it not for the large stock on hand from the preceding year, wheat would be much dearer. The old wheat is now exhausted, and none but lest year's growth is seen in the markets. Se- condly, the next harvest will in all probability be a late one, and, in consequence of the wet weather having prevented the farmers from sowing their spring wheat, the next harvest will be less pro- ductive than usual. There was a large supply of oats at the Paris market last week, but prices re- main unvaried. Oats of good quality from the Beauce and Brie are quoted at 26f. the sack of 150 kilogrammes. Rye is firm, at 21f. the 115 kilo- grammes; barley, 2Cf. to 21f. 50c. the 100 kilo- grammes. The telegraph supplies us with the prices of the provincial corn-markets held yesterday:- " Arras.-A good market; wheat in demand at from 15f. to22f.50c. the hectolitre." "Chartres.- Market well supplied ; no change in the prices of wheat." " Dijon.-An ordinary market, without anyvariation in prices; ilour offered at 46f. the sack of 125 kilorammes;* cats 17f. the 100 kilogrammes." "MIarseilles-Sales are difficult, though prices are firm. African wheat, 36f. 5c. the measure of 160 litres ; Danube, 31f." "Metz.-446 heetolitres of wheat sold at an average of 26f. 56c. the hectolitre."
			The demand for beef or mutton was not good at the market of Poissy on Thursday. There were 2,258 oxen exhibited, which sold at from If. to If. 38c. the kilogramme; 242 cov-s sold at from 90c. to If. 16c.- 11,371 sheep, from If. 30c. to If. 60c. ; 654 veai calves sold at from lf., 60c. to If. 90c. The fall in prices is attributed to the fact of the Paris butchers havingt supplled themselves at the show of prize cattle. The cows for sale at the market were of bad quality ; the sheep were good, but were not much sought for. TI'he veal calves were sold at an extrava,gant price.
			A large quantity of wuno arrived at the wine stores of Bercy last week, both by railway and by water, but there were few buyers. 20 hogsheads of Limoux vere sold at 160f. the cask of 220 litres. 50 casks of Tavel found buyers at SOf. the hectolitre. Macon wine of the last vintage was sold at 120f. the cask of 300 bottles. Wines of the Cher, of good quality, are worth from 13(f. to 135f. the cask of 300 bottles. Beetroot brandy, first quality, 5)0 degrees, is quoted in Paris at 108f. the hectolitre; Mont- pelier, 86 degrees, 135f.
			The works of the railway from Rennes to Brest, to complete the line firom Paris to that seaport, are being carried on with the greatest activity. Several sections from Montfcrt to Brest have been taken by contract, and a number of " navvies" are already employed on them.

			SARDINIA.
			(FBon OUR OWVN CoPmEsPo!.TEDr.)
			TIURIN, APRa 5. TEED SARDINIAN PARLIAIENT.
			The Eouse of Deputies sat to-day between four and five hours, and went through an astonishing amount of work. About 150 elections were duly app-oved. They manage such things here-I will not say better, but certainly otherwise than in England. An hon. gentleman takes his seat in the House of Commons, and keeps it unmolested till some peti- tioner comes to raise doubts as to the fairness of his election. Here, as in France, laws and constitutions are drawn up upon that great principle, "that an offence is always better prevented than punished." Two or threehundreddepues satround thehKing at the opening of Parliament on Monday last,
			not one ~ of whom had an acknowledged right to his seat. No election is considered valid till it lhas been inquired into. By way of compensa- tion, however, when a member has gone through the ordeal of the " Verification of Powers"-the merest piece of stupid formality-I think, on the principle of non bis in idem, his return cannot be calcd in question, however flagrant a revelation of foulplay may subsequently become apparent. The House, as I said, is divided into nine offices, bureaux, or sections, the members of which are drawn by lot. The procAs rerbaux, or minutes of the various elections are then equaUy distributed among the bureaux, care being only talzen that none of the deputies should sit in judgment on his own case. The bureaux comne to their conclusion as to the merit of each election, and appoint a reporter to convey to the Chamber the result of their delibera- tions.
			Fancy, then, a sitting of the Eouse of Commons in -which a rigmarole like the folowing should, vwith little or no respite or variety, be repeated one or two hundred times:-
			" The constituency (colleglo) of Mudborough is divided into two sections, that of Mndborough proper, and that of Boroughmud. Mudborough proper numbers 360 electors; Boroughmud has 150 inscribed voters; total number of electors 500. Of these 400 appeared at the poll on the 25th of March; 101 voted for Nr. Smith, 99 for Mr. Brown, 90 for Mr. Jones, 89 for MIr. Robinson3 11 votes
			were scattered among other candidates (one each), and 10 were void or nulL As none of the candidates obtained the legal number of votes (one third), it was necessary to proceed on the 29th to a second election, or baUot (ballottazgio), between Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown, when the electors present were 420; of these 220 voted for Smith, 190 for Brown, the other votes were annuled. The sheriff conducting the poU thereupon declared MIr. Smith to be duly elected; as neither protest, petition, or remark was brought forward in any quarter, and the proceedings were regularly conducted, the X Bureau charged me, the reporter, to recommend to the House the approval of this election;" where- upon the Speaker gravely repeats, " If no hon. gentleman has anything to say to the contrary, it shaU be understood that 3Ir. Smith has been duly returned for Audborougb.'"
			Conceive, I say, this long tiritera or litany to drone in your ears hour after hour, and day after day, and you will have a tolerably correct notion of the sweets attendant on a Parliamentary career in this country at the outset.
			Some important, interesting, and now and then grimly comical incidents ocoasionally enliven this dullest of proceedings. I was, for instance, par- ticularly struck with the unceremonious nonchalance with which some of the personages, once leading members in this very Chamber, were dismissed among the unsuccessful candidates. Solaro della
			largherita, the despotic MIinister for so many years under Charles Albert, and a very Pasha with 300 tails, when codini were still the fashion, up to the late war, only obtained 7G votes at Aosta, where he was beaten by Sommeiller, " only an engineer," novw busy at the boring of the great Mont Cenis tunnel. Revel, esteemed by some a far deeper financier and more consummate administrator than Cavonr, a constitutionalist, though a Conserva- tive, long the leader of the Centre-Right Opposi- tion, hardly found a few votes in one of those Turin constituencies of which he was for the last ten years as sure as Lord John Russell is of the city of London. On the other hand, the hot-headed, noble democrat, Lorenzo Poreto, a Minister in the stormiest days of '48, and long, the idol of the Gonoese multitude, is also beaten in his own ward of the proud city, and must either whistle for his place in the deputies or bide another chance. It is clear that new men are wanted for a new order of things, and those who were born before 18t5 will soon find out the mistake they have committed in living too long.
			A somewhat animated discussion occurred twice in the course of to-day's sitting concerning the election of emp*oyms or public officials. It is laid down as a general principle by the elec- toral law, that all Government officials receiv- ing salaries should be ineligible. Exception is made in favour of professors of universities and other learned dignitaries, who are admitted into the
			oiouse in the proportion of one-fifth of tho total number. If more than one-fifth are returned those who must go out are drawn by lot. Another exception occurs in favour of the Minister3, Secretaries of State, and other officials of high rank, whose prosence is considered necessary to explain and vindicate the conduct of the Government. Doubts arose about the election of one Professor De-]laria, who is at the same time an Inspector of Schools and a member of the Board of Health. In his latter capacity he belongs to tho second category of officials; as an Inspector he is excluded From Parliament. It would seem hardly possible in England to imagine that a man disqualitied for Par- liament on account of his receiving a stipend, which is supposed to make him subservient to Govern- ment, ehould make his way into the House merely because he enjoys another office, whether salaried or not, which does not exclude him. The general rule is, that no e,)ploye should be received. De-Mearia is admitted as a member of the Board of Health, but axcluded as an Inspector. He is, so to say, half in, half out, and cannot therefere pass the door unless he be cut in twain. Yet the matter gave rise to a long debate, and the question was adjourned, the Chamber being now in too great a hurry for the solution of such knotty points.
			Another difficulty arises as to the election of the advocate Boggio. He is an cmpioy9, not salaried at the present moment, but an expectant supernume- rary, sure to come by his pay in proper time. Is it lo be supposed that the law which objected to men in possession of a Ealary could rely on the independ- ance of a man athirst for it?
			Again, objection was made to the election of Leonzio Armelonghi, late Secretary of State in the AEmilian Government. It was answered that the ofice had ceased, together with the Government to which it belonged; whereupon the Deputy Mlinghelli asked a plain question, whether or not the Hlon. Armelonchi was in the receipt of a stipend. The Rome Minister (Farini) answered that by the Royal decree which did away with the sepa- rate administration of the Ximilia it was omacted that the public functionaries should con- tinue in the enjoyment of the emolunments at- tached to their dignities. The measuro may be just and provident so far as the Government itself is oncerned, but it is difficult to conceive how patriots, who only accepted power for a few months during a great revolutionary crisis, should find it consistent with their principles not only to pocket public money for which the country no longer receives any equivalent, but even to claim exemption from the law which excludes salaried officials simply on the plea that their stipends may be only temporary. Perhaps they think that as an office without salary is no disqualification, so neither should a salary without office.
			However, many are the hon. gentlemen in the same predicament as Signor Armelonghl, and it remains to be seen how many will be sufficiently candid and disinterested to put a truly honest and liberal construction on what would seem to any fair man a very clear and equitable law.
			Irresistible and prolonged laughter, like that of Homer's gods, followed the announcement that at Chiane, in Tuscany, eight ladies had sent in their votes by proxy, " charging with it men in their con- fidence ;" and, moreover, that the magistrates direct- ing the poll had accepted their schedc, or tickets, as valid votes. The Chamber, mostly made up of Pied- montese, was ignorant of the fact that in the muni- cipal elections in Tuscany, as formerly in Lom- bardy, women possessing the property qualification in their own right are entitled to vote by proxv.
			APRIL 6.
			The House sat again to-day, notwithstanding its being Good Friday. In the absence of the Presi- dent, Quaglia, whose life is stil despaired of since the accident of last Wednesday, Signor Zanolini, of Modena, the senior Vice-President, again took the chair.
			The dreary humdrum work of the verification of powers drags on its tedious length. A great number of elections are summarily disposed of by unchaUenged approbation. A long and not unim- portant discussion arises as to the validity of the return of Signor Bo, a Profusor of Medi- cine at Genoa, and Director of the General Board of Marine Health. A member of the Upper Board of Health at Turin is eliaible. An attempt was made to prove that the same privilege extended to the Board of Marine Health at Genoa. Rattazzi, who denied all identity between the two Boards, and contended that Bo, as a member of the Genoese Board, was ineligible, put forth again the old argument that as Bo, in his quality of a professor of a university, was eligible, this qualification should destroy in his favour the character of ineligibility attaching to his position as a member of the Board of Health; since by virtue of one office he could be a deputy, and by reason of the other he could not, Rattazzi concluded that the Chamber should pronounce in the sense that was more favourable to the deputy-elect. He added that the law (framed by Rattazzi himself in Novem- ber, 1859) did not exclude salaried officials because it was deemed that their stipend would be a hindrance in the discharge of their duties as inde- pendent members of Parliament, but becausa deputies had necessarily to give their votes on the budget, of which the stipends of officials were an item, and a salaried employ6 sitting in the House would therefore have to give judgment in his own cause.
			Rattazzi was met in this very specious argument by several deputies, and especially by Chiaves, who triumphantly contended that if any man in the enjoyment of a paid office by which he was excluded from Parliament might become qualified by simpnly obtaining another office which did not exclude hin, it would always be in the power of Government to flU the House with their officials, by bestowing on them such offices as were no hindrance to a m.n's admission into Parliament. By the same argument a canon, or other priest having " the cure of souls," who by reason of his sacred ministry was ineligible, wvould cease to be so the moment that Government numbered him amQn.the msembera of the Board of
			Health, or of any other Board equally favoured by thelaw. The dicusaionwasher interzupted byan incident which created a very deep and painful Een- sation.
			General Garibaldi had taken his seat in one of the upper benches of the Extreme Left (the political niuazwCs are but imperfectly marked by a man's place in the House in the Sardinian Parliament), having on his right side Laurentl Robando, a deputy from Nice, a man of extreme political tendencies and a violent temper. The brave General sat metionless hour after hour, exhibiting a rare powver of en- durance and composure under the infliction of the endless twaddle of some of his colleagues. Towards half-past 4 the President of the Council of Ministers (Count Cavour) unexpectedly entered, and took his place at the Ministerial board, when almost instantly a deep-ringing voice called out " Drmando la parez !"-the oustomary form by wvhich a deputy
			expresses his wrish to address the House.1
			General Garibaldi was on his legs; a profound1 silence ensued; when the General, in few, clear, and affluent wo.ds, begged leave to interrupt the present discussion for a short time while he puta pies- tion (fare uena interpdlcnza) to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
			The President of the Chamber offered a few re- marks relative to the condition of the House, which was not yet legally constituted.
			Count Cavour broke in with great alacrity, and in a visible state of irritation, contending that no discussion was allowable before the Chamber had constituted itself, except on the subject of the veri- fication of power* and adding, with warmth and even a certain asperity, that even i a question were asked he w ould not answrer it.
			Garibaldi insisted, when Cavour turned to the I*resident, and invited him to put the "previous question" to the vote of the Chamber.
			Garibaldi's friend, Laurenti Robando, here ad- dressed the Hlouse in very passionate tones, pleading the urgency of the present situation, and contending that as if the Austrians were at the gates of Turin it would be idle to say that Parliament ought to remain inactive because the members were not formaUy introduced to one another, so now the French were in Nice.
			Boggio and other members stormily called for the previous question.
			Mellana (Extreme Left), sitting on the left of Garibaldi, observed that even if, in the unconsti- tuted state of the House, it was not lawful to de- liberate as to the purport of a question, there was, however, no reason why the question itself should nlot be put; he begged that freedom of speech shouldbhe given to the General. EIe added that it stood written nowhere in the Constitution that the Hrouse could not deliberate in its present state. If the Chamber only existed after the verification of powers, why had it been sworn on Monday last ? and if deputies were no deputies till their election was approved, why had the Kinug on that day ad- dressed mere nonentities?
			Rattazti alleged precedents as arguments against any deliberation previous to the constitution of the Chamber.
			The H3ouse was tben divided, and after speedily disposing of the motion bylines, " that the question should be adjourned," it adopted the "previous questhon" by a considerable majority.
			Thus was Garibaldi foiled in his first attempt to take up the oause of his native city. Cavour is evidently bent on gaining time. To-day's Opiniona announces that Savoy and Nice will be called upon to pronounce on their own destinies by universal suffrage in about eight days; and if Nice be made, by fair means or foul, to vote for annexation to France, there is an end for ever of Garibaldi's Par- liamentary opposition. Nevertheless, Cavour can- not fail to have a mauuais quart t'hcure before this Savoy-Nice matter is settled. Some of the most determined patriots of the latter place have even been heard talking of personal oies de fait against him. Poor Garibaltii, on leaving the Carignano Palace, was beard saying with anguisb, " It is well the world should know the fine Parliament we have."

			SW[TZERLAND.
			(FROM OUR OWN CORR4POXDBNT.)
			GENEBVA, ArnRL 5.
			Intent on watching every phase in this Savoy question, and correcting any false impression which might have been produced during my former pas- sages through the country, I preferred the longer and slower route by Annecy to the quiclcer one by Culoz to Geneva. I am glad that I did so, although the impression derived from this third trip is far from agreeable. I have no more the heart to laugh at Savoy and the Savoyards. I can easily explain the " why" to any one who has seen an emigrant vessel starting from the London Docks orfrom Liver. pool,-those hundreds of miserable wretches who, driven by necessity, have no choice left but to leave their homes and dear associations and seek a new home in unknown regions. Most of them, although with a beavy heart, try to make the best of their hard lot, and to silence their sorrow by conjuring up golden dreams of the future. The excitement produced by the preparations gives them courage, and abstracts their thoughts for a moment from the bitterness of their fate. But there comes a moment when all is ready on board,-the chains are up, the steamtug is made fast, and then even the pluckiest loses heart. In most this supreme moment is almosttoo much, and it deprives them of all power of reaction; they sink down in mute apathy, staring at the objects around them with a listles gae, while others try to take in with that last glance a whole world of recolections which is to last them for the rest of their lives. Every house, every stone, every ship, every ateeple becomes a friend for whom they have a parting look, a fareweU glance.
			Well, go and assist at one of these departures, and you will have the impression which Savoy Droduces on the observer at this moment. There are no French soldiers on the line from Chambery to Geneva, but all know that it is over with them. There is no more discussion about future prospects - there are no moro attempts to stultify the mind with golden dreams. The hour of parting is at hand, and throws everything else into the background. A dead, mourniful silence is the prevailing feature, and an air of despondency pervades the whole country, which Is, above all, strikiug in the otherwise liveliEst town of Savoy, Annecy. The recall of the Pled- montese Governor brought home to every one the hour of parting. Piedmontese employgs were not all popular figures in Savoy, and yet now, as one after another leaves, they are looked after as so many friends. Verily, if some good fairy- in the 19th century-were to come down and offer at this last hour a real choice, I beleve almost every one would eagerly choose to remain for ever with Piedmont. All interest in the movement of troops and the news from Turin has ceased; they know it is useless after the King's proclamation and the recall of the Piedmontese functionaries. The pro- mise that they would be allowed to manifest their wishes excites only bitter amiles; no one believes in its efficacy; no one thinkg of the future, and every one seems wrapped up in, the memos'y of the past. You hear at every moment, " NVe were uo well with the Piedmontese,"-" We did not want to change,"-" All was getting right,"-" Why disturb us ust now "
			The annexationist party is right in holding univer- sal suffrage in horror, and trusting rather to some other species of manifestation, NTot that these self- same people who regret the Piedmonteso would vote .agJainst France-how can they, after the cession by Piedmont? Bat all the influence of th Government which is in their bands would not be sufficient to produce a brilliant result, and make the people vote. They have always let others direct their fate, and they will let others do so again.
			The preliminary inquiry made into the foolish proceedings at Thonon has added very little new to what was known before. There is not the slightest trace of any participation or connivance on the part of the cantonal authorities of,Geneva. The police authorities only would be to blame had the at- tempt been made in a State having for its funds mental law the prying gendarme, but not in a free country where the police interferes only in cases of illegality. It was well known that Perrier was one of the hottest heads at Geneva-that he was in connexion with all kinds of secret societies in France; he had pronounced himself inthelast popular meeting for immediate armed action in the three districts, but had been overruled in his projects by a general opposition. iewas, besides, known to fre- quent in the evening public-houses, chieflypatronized by workmen, to Bpeechlfy there and make wild proposals. In any weli-gendarmed country this would have been sufficient to make him and every one of his steps the object of the soliCitude of the police. Here his behaviour passed as harmless foDy, and, sure as the anthorities were that he had no means of making himself dangerous ho waa
			alloweed to drink and haranule to his heart's con- tent, liko any other free citizen of Geneva.
			It was after one of these nights of haranguing, which, like many of its predecessors, might have been expected to end in soUd sleep, that the expedition was undertaken. Even those who were in the first moment of indignation mostviolent against the negli- gence of the police, accusing it even of comuvance, acknowledged now that the only fault was not to have thought of extra Drecautions in these excited times. This has been done now, as you may see from the numerous patrols of gendarmes who are about the streets at night. Besides this sorme of the troops lately arrived here have been placed on different points of the frontier, to prevent the renewal of a similar attempt. The absurd failure of the first, the general indignation provoked by it, and the energetic measures taken to put an end to it, are all so many pledges that nothing more is to be apprehended on this score.
			If the Swiss cause has received a considerable chock by the election of five French candidates out of Eix in Northern Savoy, this check has almost been repaired on another side by the moral suDport which their claims have received in England, and, by the means of this latter, in the rest of Europe. The feeble declarations made by the great Powers when the note of M. de Thouvenel was communi- cated to them seemed to promise very little, and at one moment Switzerland was placed in the position of standing alone in the defence of her rights. It is but justice to say that even in the most critical momuent she never faltered, but was prepared for extremes. All parties seemed to have disappeared in the moment of danger, and Government, as welR as the people, vied with each other to show them- selves equal to the emergency. People may laugh about cheap moral support and scoff at its value, but no one who has ever been in danger will under- value the effect of a cheering voice. The effect of that raised in England for Switzerland is striking. 'When I was last here all was excitement and appre- hension; every one vwas on the quti vive, occupied with the idea whether the French would occupy the neutralized districts, and meditating what might be done to prevent it. Such excitement is a bad coun- sellor, especiaUy if there is a lurking suspicion that your adversary will take unfair advantage of you. A false rumour would have been sufficient to pro- voke a collision of which no one could foresee the end. This danger is over now, and, sure as the Swxiss are now of not being left alone, they will wait quietly for the decisions of the Powers.
			But do not think they have for all that abandoned their fate into the hands of others. The fairer prospects have not checked the resolation of the Federal Assembly; it has voted unanimously full powers and unlimited credit, which is, in fact, a dictature pro &amp;m. for the Federal CounciL The resolution was brought up yesterday to what may bo called the Upper House-the Conseil des Etats, and passed as unanimously and almost without dis- cussion as in the National CounciL
			This vote of fnul powers concludes the exfraordl- nary meeting of tho Federal Assembly, and to-day the members are expected back in their homes.

			Tl:E COZ'TULAR SERVICE IN JApAN.
			TO THE EDITOR OF T`EE TIMIES.
			Sir,-When, in February, 1859, Lorc MIalmes- bury was selecting Consuls and Vice-Consuls for uture servico in Japan, it became known that a young gentleman who had recently rotired from service in the Royal Horse Guards Blue was likely tc obtain one of the appointraents. Mr. Wise con- sequently inqJuired of MIr. Seymour Fitegerald, then 7u7nder-Secretary for Foreign Affirs, whether Cap- tain Howard Vyso's appointment was likely to take place, and received from Mr. Disraeli the curt reply that it was, and that, " in his opinion, it was n appointment which would secure to the country the services of a most efficient officer." On a sub- sequent occasion Mr. MoncktonMilnes remonstrated with M4r. Fitzgerald en having made this appoint- ment in defience of the recommendations of the Committee on the Consular Service, of which he (MAr. WVilson) had been chairman, and in reply 1%r. Fitzgerald " hoped that he should cease to hear any more of these unfair attack-s on the appoint- ment of a gentleman of ability and station to a service in which he believed he would in future dis- tinguish himself."
			Supported by Mr. Disraeli, Lord Malmesbury, and Mr. Fitzgerald, Captain Howard Pyse went to Japan, and it appears, from the papers recently published by the Foreign-office relating to our rela- tions with that country, that the gallant officer has fultilled the expectations of his patrons, and that he has distinguished himself, though not exactly in the way in which, from their alleged knowledge of his abilities, they appear to have expected.
			The papers to which I allude contain four or five short letters from Captain Vyse to his chief, Tr. Rutherford Alcock. Thiough very short, they clearly reveal one fact, that Captain Vyse must have en- tered the army long before the Board of Military Education had commenced their labours, and that he must have escaped the usual examinations to which candidates for the Consular service are now subjected; for the language in which his letters are written is certainly not English, neither is it] Japanese. This, however, is but a small matter. It would appear that the gallant captain established himself as Consul at Kanagawa, in Japan, in No- vernber, 1859, and that on the Gth of that month it became his duty to report to his chiefs what he calls "a cold, horrible, bloodyassassination" on the person of a Chinese servant of a Portugueso gentleman. Captain Vyse states in the letter recording this crime that he has taken upon himself to declare that the Chinese servant of the Portuguese gentleman was an English subject, and to require that " the perpetrator of the cowardly bloody act shall be handed over to the British Envoy to be dealt with as it might seem best." Another letter of the same date to Mr. Alcock was as follows
			"Slr,-I have thehonour to forwardfor your Inspection a copy of a notiflfatlon I have deemed it necessary to Issue for the safety of the Brltish at Yokahama, to enablo them to guard against these dastardly and cold-blooded assassiustions, if possible, to which, I grleve to say, the Japanese are so Prone.
			I ' NLOtERE.-NOTMIOATIO,, No. 18.
			"'British Consulate, Kanagawa, Nov. 6, 1859.
			"'Theundersigned, HerBritannlc Majesty's acting Consul at Kanagawa, desires all British subjects wlU, for the future, go about always armed as mruch as possible, for their own personal safety, as regards a revolver, or any other deadly weapon they may be able to obtain; and the undersigned glves free permission to, and hopes that all British subjects wll give free use to the same, on any reasonable provo- cation, as regards the Japanese, whether official or non- official. "-'. HOWARD VYSE,'"
			Mlr. Aacock, to do him justice, appears to have been shocked by the langua-ge and conduct of his subordinate, and promptly forwarded a replyto him, directing him to recall at once the notification which he had issued, and pointing out to him that the sufferer was clearly not a British subject, and that if his assailant should be detected it was directly contrary to the express provisions and the whole spirit of the Treaty between Great Britain and Japan that he should be either claimed by or sur- relsdered to theBritish Envoy.
			Upon this Captain Howard Vyse issued a second notilication, worded as follows -
			" British Consalate, Kanazawa-, Nov. 7, 1859.
			"Theundersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul at Eacagawa, begs to inform oll British subiects at Yoka- hama that he has this day received orders from Her Britan- aic Majesty's Consnl-General to rescind the last notification No. 18, issued by the undersigned: Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in Japan deeming it unnecessary for British subjects to go about armed, excepting when it is dusk; after having received such assurance from the Japanese authorities at Yokahama of every possible means being now taken to insure the capture of the petpetrator of the late horrible assassintion.
			" The undersigned further begs to cauition aU British subjects as to how they make use of their arms; having by this notifcation been informed that they are not to carry arms except in the desk of the evening, and even then to be very cautious as to what use they make of them.
			"(Signed) F. HOWARD VYSE,
			" Her Britannic Malesty's Acting Conscl." Iam, Sir, your obecdient servant.

			THB TED STATBs.
			(FROM OM OWN COR O\
			NBW YORKl, M.Arwl, .
			The Liberal party in Mexico having withdrawll their troops from Alvarado, and concentrated them at Vera Cruz the interest is at present fised on that place, wvhich is s;urrounded by the forces of AFira- mon. Judg,ing from the newMspaper reports, the absence of bIr. M'Lan is seriously felt by the Darti- sans of Juarez One letter writer says that in con- sequence of it " Anerican stock and prestige have faUen considerably, and if ever his presence was needed here it is now, to meet these British diplo- matio combinations which are about being esta- blished by the British Government, and also to restore our influernce." Others write in even stronger terms. Meanwhile we have the official and other accounts of the capture of the Miramon steamers, as foUows -
			" S I " New Orle.ans, March 19.
			"Sir,-Lieutenant Cha,pman left Vera Cruz on the 11th
			inst., in command of the prize stearcerhlarquis of Havannab as bearer of despatches to the department from Captaia Jarvis; but learning on my arrival here this morning that he had not arrived, I deem it my duty to iorward the fol- lowing report to von.
			"On the 5th inst. General MIlramon commenced tho s1ege of Ver,a Crus, and on the 6th General ilazin ap. peared before the city wvith this and a.nother steamer, and not show.ing his coloars, Commander Turner, in the, Saratoga, with detachments from the Savannah and Preble, in the steamers Indisnola and Wave, wias ordered to proceed to the anchorage of the steamors, off Anton Lizardo, and ascertain their character. Upon near- ing them one of them was seen to be moving off, when a shot was fired ahead of her to bring her to, and the India- nola sent to overhaul her. The hail from 'he Indianola was replied to by a fire from the General Miramon's gnns and a volley of musketry, when tho Saratoga fired a broad- side, and the action became general, resulting in the capture of both of biarin's steamers, with himself aud a large num- ber of his men on board.
			"Captain Jarvis ordered both prizes to this port. The Preble wil be here in a few days, with Manrin and mnnst of the prisoners on board, the rest being distributed between this steamer and the Marquis of Havannuh.
			" Yonr despatch will reach me here. Respectfully,
			"R D. MHINOR, Lieutenant United States' Navy,
			Commanding prize steamer General .iramon. " HEon. Iaao Toucey, Secretary of the Navy."
			Lieutenant Chapman also reports as follows:-
			" I am in charge of one of the steamers. The Preble ac- companies the other, with the majority of the prLsoners_ the loss of life small, and among the crew only. They fired tbe first shot. I will be in FWashington as soon as possible. The engine of the vessel commanded by me broke down at sea. By ordtx of Captain Jarvis, I am directed to say the sllps at Vera Crus are very short of provisions-
			a;rtienlarly bread, It is improdent for any of them to l'eave Vera Crn* at this time in the present state of feeling there."D
			We have also further and more detailed accounts concorming these vessels. They were fitted out at Havannah to operate against the Juarez Govern- ment, which was then in possessiou of Vera Cruz and most of the provincial towns. They sailed from Havannahon the 26th of Februaryunderthe Spanish flag, which they substituted for the Mlexican flag as soon as they wvere out of port. They reached Vera Cruz a little before noon on the miorning of the Gth ; sigualled as suspicious vessels, they continued their approach, nevertheless, with the result conveyed to you by the last packet. The account of the engage-. ment, if such an affair can be called an engagement, is given by the Juarez party thus:-
			"The three vcssels arrived at Anton Lizardo a little he- fore midnight. This is a very safe harbour, some 15 mies below Vera Cruz, and welt protected by reefs on every side. Hero Mramon had proviously hoisted a 'dag to indi- cate the place of rendezvous. Both steamers still had steam up, and seemed to have taken position as if to make good their escape if pursued. On the arrival, howrever, of the Saratoga, they were busily engaged cemmnunicating w^ith tho shore, end, though the moon wvas shining clear as day, did not see her approach tillt too late. They were drcadfulDy frightened, end did not aseem to be decided at first wrhat course be purue. In the meantime, the Saratoga sent out a small boat to demand their nationality. They fired upon it twice as before stated. The Saratogathen opened a broadside upon the General iramon, on board of which was Commodore Marin, and came near sinking her at the firs' shot. The steamer returned the shot, but, in the meantime, got under way, natuLrally anxious to got out of Ho hot a place. The Indianola pursued her and soon came up with her. The Iiraimon showed fight, but the Indianola returned her fire, and finaUy boarded her at the poin' of the bayonet. It wvas in this engagement that the Indianola had her pilot-house carried away by a cannon shot. She also received other slight damage, bet nothing to in any way disable her, nor does any one on board appear to have been wounded, except General Goiconris, who received a slight wound on one of his hands.
			"While aU this was going on, tUie Saratoga was paying her respects to the Marques de la Habana. This was the vessel that cleared from Eavannah as a Spaniard. She did not offer muich resistance. A single shot from the Saratoga, brought her to, and then for tiho first time she hoisted tho Spanish flda.
			" This afiair finished, the Wave, until now in attendanco on the Saratoga, went to the aid of the Indianola, from which the General Miramon was making a desperate effort to escape, after once being boarded. In her flight, however, she ran aground, and, after a few sbots, finally surrendered withont restsance. She was not got off, however, til two days after, and then only by the aid of her consort, the Marques do la Habana. She was finally tow7ed into Vera Crez by the Indianola, while the Marques de In EhIbana had the unexpected honour of retarning the compliment, by towing back the Saratoga."
			We hear from the Isthmus, in the midst of in- creasing accounts of the incredible riches of the WVashoe mines, that tho Senate of Bogota have rati- fied the Cass-Herran Treaty, with the amendments affixed to it by the Senate of the United States. It is also understood here that the Cabinet at Wash- ington will adhere to the American claim in Puget's Sonnd D
			The bondholders of the Chicago, Alton, and St. Louis Railroad Company have given in their adhesion to the new scheme of capitaliZation with wonderful unanimity; of the first mortgage only about $300,000 are unassented, most of which are held. in Europe, and have, consequently, still the right to adhere. Of the seconds, all are in but $64,000; and nearly aU the thirds are in-so that this long and melancholy litigation may be regarded as ended. The settlement is one which might just as well have been made three years ago as nloV. No one loses anything except the immediate payment of demands that could not have been collected.
			The lhinois Central direction have issued a circu- lar concerning the Freeland bonds of that company, proposing to retire them when due by a newr 8 per cent, issue at par rnnningfor five years, any balance not subscribed for bytheloth of June tohbe met by an assessment on the stock. This circular con- tains some interesting statements relative to the traffic and affairs of this company *_
			"Th earnings of the road in 1859 were $2,114,448 9Sc., and in 1856 $91,976,578 52c. In the early part of the year the distress in Ilinois, from the failure oE the harvest of the two preceding years, caused such inactivity in business that ouT traffic diminished even from the low figares of tha preceding year. For the first eight months the decrease was $85,091 23o. In September, after the wheat harvest, basi- nas improved ; and in the last two months, tho Indian corn crop caing oP portunely made up the deficit, and gave an increase of $130,803 40c. for the year. The lowest point in our affairs has apparently passed. and the very satisfactory Increase of local traffic during six months, ending the 29th uit,, of $324,299 41c., confirms the estimate in the Decem- bar circular of a gain of 331-3 per cent., or $700,000, the pre- sent year. This will exceed the earnings of 1856 and It is worthy of note that even during 1859 the failing off In freight earnings compared with 1856, our best year, is only 5 per cent.-tbe figTres were $1,107,019 lOe. in 1859, against $1,156,471 23a. in 1856. In the year 1856 there was a large through freight traffic to the north-west; the rivers were low, and merchandise was forced upon the ralUways, which has not been the case since. Albhough the harvest of grain to the acre, cultivated in 8.59, was less than half of that gathered to the acre in 1856, the ex- tended area under cultivation has shown a better resalt in the exports from Chicago than was anticipated, and demon- strates that the working population and surfaco cultivated has increased largely since 1856. In that year, with very abundant harvests, and such high prices that every availablo bushel of grain was brought out, 21,588,221 bushels were shipped from Chicago; the past year (1859), after two bad
			harvests, and a third which was only partial, there were-% 16,663,795 bushels sent to Chicago. Therefore, it is be- lieved that the first year in wh,ch full harvests of wheat and Indian corn are gathered will be folloved by an export of 30,000,000 bshels. Inl 1640 the total export was 40,000 bushels of wrheat.
			" Tho passenger trafic of 185G was benefited by tho emi- gration to Iowa and Mnneota ; this has been almost entirely cuLt off, and the local passenger traffic mnuch re- duced from the poverty of the farmers-the decline is from S1,112,401 78c. in 1856 to Is11,411 90c. in 1859, or $300,989 SSc. decrease. Veo are now gaining hn our pas- sengers to and from the Sooth eince the opening of the lines to New Orleans and Memphis. The improved work- ing of the Terre Haute Ene to St. Lonis, and the extension of the Dubuque ine, with the opening of the Grand Trunk to Port Saia, will also help our passenger traffic this year, end the directors trust that the earnings from this sourco in 1860 wIl equal those of 1856.
			" The working expenses for 1853 were $1,489,579 52c., against $1,419,954 S0c. in 1858, an increase of $G9,624 72c. For maintenance ofE way and of machinery $90,032 2c. more is charged than in 1858. The particular attention of the shareholders is called to the report of the superin- tendent and the statement connected with it. These are in foll detail, and, as wel as those of the master of ma- chinery, manifest a thoronuh knowledge of and fidelity to oar Interests. The directors wil confine themselves to re- marking that the tariffs for transportation of freight have not beenroduced, that the promise of a large trailo Iha coal is very encouraging, and that the southern trade at the Calro outlet of wheat, oats, f'our, corn, end provisions Is largely increasinz, accompanied by a gatn in the return freights of sugar, cotton, molasses, coffce, and fruit."
			The new scheme of the eastern division of the
			Ohio and 5Smimippi Railroad Company also pro-
			nais'es to be succezsful. -the combination now em- braces over eight millions of the eleven milions. About $4,500,000 Construction Bonds have been surrendered Eince the scheme was brought out, and there is norw no doubt of its success. The traffic of this road is reported to be increasing, and the road itself to be in very good order.
			The Echeme for reorganizing the Erie meets with Oppositionat Mbany. The Legislatures of New Jersey and Pennsylvania have passed laws authorizing a sale and transfer of the property and franchises of the old company to the new company. The Senate of New York have, after a violent opposition, done the same thing; but there is great danger that the Bill WiM be killed in the Assembly by the influence of creditors who wish to secure for themselves some special advantages, which the trustees will not con- sent to. I cannot Eee that the failuro of this Bill can work any great injury to the parties to the contract. The adhesions to that are so large as to make it sure that it will be carried out. Owing to the maturity of the second mortgage, and to the large amount of interest in arrear, there was not much probability that the property could be vested in the new company before the next winter, dis- charged of all claims. If the Bill fails this year, this powerful organization can complete its arrange- maents, so as to be ready to carry them into effect next winter, the moment the necessary authority is obtained. The authority which has been already obtained from Noe Jersey and Pennsylvania is more important than that which is azked for from the St-ate of New York.
			The Yew York Tri&amp;unc publishes the following notice of the iechigan Central Railroad Com- pany:-
			" Debt is one of the prominent evils in the railway sys- tem of this countr. It has subjected the community to more swindling, more humbug, and more less than anything else in the catalogne of railway reverse. It is incidental to the progreeasive suirit of the country, and perhaps a necessary evi, until we attaln age and substance; but it has led to troubles of the gravest character. The adoption of measures to remove this incubus on the prosperity ef rallways should meet the hearty approval of the community, and in this spirit we recognize the wisdom of the sinking fond system which is now a feature of the times. The Michigan Central Ralroad Company has given a good example in this way, by providing liberally from net earnings the means which are to absorb and extinguish its bonds. It is almost super- fluous to say that railway companies heretofore have scarcely considered the necessity of providing for payment of bonds at matuity. The controlling idea has been to get money, with but little regard to ies return. In tho sp-rit of re- form, however, tbe performance of promises now seems to be a part of the programmne, and the 'sinking fund' prin. ciple forms a portion of every sound p!a n for the liquida- tion of debt."
			The Mrissouri Legislature adjourned without wait- ing for the action of the Governor upon the Bill for enlarging the debt of that State for the benetit of the railroad companies. The total issue authorized by the late Bil was $4,13Q,000.

			HORISE TAMIMG.
			TO TIE ED0Ml'R OF TIItE TIMES.
			Sir,-M3yattention hasi ben called to a letter in TUc TiMnes of this day sismel a " De:luded Victim," which con- tains such glArlng n.s'srtemeenet that I cannot in justice to myself allow it to pass unnoticedL
			In tho fi-st place, your correspondent leads the public to sUppoie that the advertisement of my horse taming per- formance at tile Alhaubra Palace contained a profession of "marvellous" power on mly part; that is not the case.
			The two unbroken colts upon which I experimented were the only subjects that my agent could procure. One had never had a bridlle upon Idm until a few mlnutes before he was led iato the arena, and he is not yet shod - he stands over 14 hands and a half higb. and is now at Mr. Austin's stables. IIyde Park-cormer, wvho wkill vouch that I never touched himt, or even sav hirtt more than once, since he was ledfromtte ri`waystUtGen. The otherwas a colt,standingat the same place at the present time, the same age (three years), and near 15 Lands high ; they both might have been as rwild as the '- DI)u!aed Victiiu" wished them to be, for anything I knew ti the contrary, when they were handed to me in the clrcle.
			As to their being " hIlf-starved," if the " Deluded Victim" knows anything of hbsec breeding, hoc also knows very well that at this scason of the vear colts fresh from the fields cauiot be as sleek anti fat as a stabled back, for this reason, there hai been so little grass for them, and that natura has furnished them with rough, shaggy coalts to preserve themn froue cold; and if lie knows anything at all shbut colt training, Le will know that a colt overbur- dened with flhsh Is far easier to subdue than one in moderate condition. If he is a friend to horses, he ought to see more to admiro in the subjigation of colts by gentle means in a short space of timue tban by a series of abortive struggles and tnnatural contortloni of the horse and operator, whIch I hear h.-s been practil hv another male professor of tIre art, who in one ease (at Ilcoars. Allenes Riding Academiy) kept the straps on a "' common hack" 40 minutes, the same proftssor having stated in his advertisements for the last two years that " his system was applied without the aid of plhysical force. thereby inducing young ladies to pay five gulneas to vitness his experinments.
			I did not intend to have said anything in reference to the "great professor." lnt when It is considered that I am an Englishwoman and he a frerigner, I think my countrymen and wemen will agree with me that I should have a fair opportnnitY of pn' ving my aii'aty in the science I have chosenbefere the" Deluded Victim" hsadmadean unworthy attempttO crush meo on my first appearance before tho public.
			W7ithregardto the" hybrid animal," it has been exhibit- ing in London a considerable time, and has been seen by many cessnent naturalists w ho will certify that their opinion is thaXt it is wihat It wars representedt to be in the advertice. ment. I noversawit before Ien-&gt;terd thelists with it, but if it had been as refractory when under restraint as i was represented to be, it might have suited yoar correspondent better, and I am sure that I shonld have beenbetter pleased 'with it.
			As to my " tugging at the colts in a rough and awkward manner," all who k-now me also know that I never use a horse roughly, and if even my ill-natured enemny the " Dc- luded Victim" will find me a tall, fat, sleel-, and pursy colt fresh from grass (one that he thinks wril devour me). I will prove to him and the public that I can subdno it in as little timo as I did the " half-starved animals and the " hybrild ' and, fetrther, I will insure him and his fanily a front scat, free of charge, to every expesition li cheeses to witness of mine in Londoni, and guarantee that if le 'iil divest his mind of prejudice against ms that I will render all my future expositions in such a maner that shall please him.
			I tins. Sir, sear obedient servant.

			TO THE EDITOP. OF THlE TIMES.
			Sir,-I hops your correspondent "Precursor" will gratIfy your readers by giving his authority for the asssrtion that " curser" is an English word signifylng runner.
			But, however this may be, he is wrong when lie says,- " Mr. Bowyer's cursers both run and ouroc ;" for an excom- munication is not a curse. " Ezcomnszuicetio cst co7mmus
			ionec cxclusio ;"-this is the proper definition. It is a censure, but certainly not a cuirse. So St. John Chrisestom Honil. 16, on St. Panl's Epistle to the Romans, says that " anathema" (the word used by the Apostle, end which is synonymous with the major excommunication) means ex- clusion and segregation from the Church. There are, how- ever, ancient instances of anathema being accompanied by a malediction resembling in principle the Cominnation Ser- vice in the Anglican Prayer-book.
			" Precuroser" seems to think that excommuniication is only used in the Roman Catholic Church. iut he will find it repeatedly in the Canons of the Anglican Church.
			I hopeyoa will publish this letter.
			Your obedient sen-ant.
			GEORGE BOWYER,
			Temple, April 9.

			SIOMCING AND FATAL OCCURRtaXcE N NE.AR LI-sI- roor.-A sad occurrence too'k place on Friday night at the Eastham Ferry, on the Cheshire side of the 1ersey, which has already resulted in the death of two persons, and whicb, it is feared, will also prove fatal to several others. As is usual on Good Friday, the ferry-boats plying betweenLiver- pool and the various ferries were much crowded throughout the day. One of the most attractive ferries is Eastham, on the Cheshire shore. six miles from Liverpool, and it is popu- larly called " the Richmond of the Mersey." Friday being
			exceedingly fine, the Eastham boats conveyed pleasure- I seekers from Liverpool In large numbers, and in the evening there was a vast accusmulation of return passengers for the last boat to Liverpool. About a quarter of an hour before the steamer came up there were nearly 400 persona waiting on the slip. This large number caused great preasare against the rope running aloing the side of the livp and at length the rope gave way, when upwards of 100' persons were precipitated into the water, or rather into the mud. for the tide was very low at the time. It was darkc, and the screaras and cries of the unfortunate people wreTe
			heairtrending. Lights were brought, and they were extri-', c,ated with al possible speed. Two young women dled almost immediately. They were dreadfully muti'ated, and it was quiite apparent that they badliterallybeen trampled todeath. 1 pwvrds of .o0 others have received various wounds and bruises. and severil were found with their limbs broken.
			were taken to the EXIsthan Ferry Hotel, close by, here they at present remain,i unable to he removed ; others har.e i;en conveyed to Liverpool, and ann y are pronounced in a ta^ngerouAs state, It is rurnouredl that t!:e accident wams caus. d by som e one cr.tting the rope, but wve hope this sup- position is erroneous.

			THE RBLIOUS DISTURBANCES IN T*HE
			CHURCH OF ST. GEORGES-IN-THE-EAST.
			Yesterday VW=Iiam Dicki.nso, an ederly man, who was described as a journeyman cl -ckma ker, of No. 26, Walcot- terrace, Ken ington-cross, was brought before -r. S-LFR, at the Thames Polce-court, charged with having wilfuUy and purpoely disturbed the Rev. Bryan King, the minister l officiating at the parish church of SLt George's-in-the-East, on Sunday evening last, contrary to the Act 1 Mary, ees. 2, cap. 3 (1553).
			Mr. Joseph Smith, solicitor, conducted the prosecution on the part of the rector and subordinate clergy of St. George; Mr. Charles Stoddart, solicitor, defended the w- cased.
			Although the court was weU filled with the vestrymen and parishloners of St. George's and tbe immediate friends of the rector, the greatest decorum prevailed throughout a long investigation, and there was none of that manifestation of feeling which has prevailed on former occasions, when
			isimsr cases arising out of the Tractarian innovations in St. George's Church have been undez discus-lon in this cosrt.
			Mr. Smifh, in opening the ease, said the worst disturb- ance that ever occurred in St. George's Church took place on Sunday evening. In this case there was a conspiracy to disturb the services of the church, though he was not pro- pared to prove the prisoner joined in the conspiracy. He was, however, prepared to prove that a riot took place in the church, and that the prisoner took part in it. He should also prove the prisoner made a confession of his guilt. The Prisoner lived a considerable distance from the church, and had no interest in the parish wvhatever. Mr. Smith then referred to the varions Acts of Parliament relating to brawl- ing and making disturbances in churches, commencing with the Act of Mary, of sanguinary memory, and terminating with the statute of the 52,1 of George II., cap. 155, and laid he would take the case under the Act of Uniformity, the 1st of Elizabeth, cap. 2 (155S). Under that Act the offender was liable to a penalty of 100 marks for the first offence, 400 marks for the second offence, and the forfeiture of all bis goods and chattels and imprisonment for life for the third offence.
			Mr. Stoddart reminded the magistrate that the prisoner was charged under the Act of Mary, and he was prepared only to answer that charge.
			Mr. Smith objected to the way the cl:arge was entered by Mir. Eiowie, the superintendent of the K division of pollee.
			Mr. Eowie explained. Ee quoted the statute of Mary for the information of the bench and alU parties concerned. He was not aware Mr. Smith was retained in the ease when he entered the charge.
			Mr. SELFE said the superintendent had done quito right. He was not, however, bound hy the precise words of the charge-sheet. Ee did not care what a man was charged with, unless it could be proved he was taken completely by surprise. A man might be charged with burglary, and a very different offence be proved. That had often happened in his experience.
			Mr. Francis B. Baker, a surgeon, seid he was at present staying at the Rectory, St. George's-in-the-East. He was present at the evening service in St. George's Church on Sunday evening. He was sitting three or four yards from the prisoner. on a seat running alongside the east wall of the church. The prisoner was in front of him. While the Creed w.as bein read he saw and heard the prisoner hiss three times. That certainly tended to disturb the minister in the discharge of his duties very much. The second time the prisoner hissed witness turned ronnd and saw Mr. Allison, an inspector of police. The prisoner stood by him and hissed again. He called Mr. Allison's attention to the prtsoner. Mr. Allison said to the prisoner," Will you go out of the church with that gentleman ?" and the prisoner did so. The prisuer went out very quietly indeed, and when he got outside the church he said he wasverysorry for what he had done; thaehe hadcoea long distanc eand would not act in like manner again. He told the prisoner it was the cause of God and the Church. The prisoner said, "I hope God will forgive me," and witness said, "Ask him ; I hone he wiUl."
			In cross-cxamination by Mfr. Stoddart,tbe witness said he had been in the practice of attending St. George's Church for several months, and commenced his attendance there soon after the unhappy disputes commenced.
			Mr. Stoddart.-What is the cause of the disturbances in St. George's Church?
			Mr. SELFE interposed. He bhought it best not to go into the cause of the disturbances. It wss enough for him that there was a distuLrbance.
			In cross-examination the witness said that ho was an army surgeon, and had no settled residence. He came to St. George's Rectory on a visit to the Rev. Bryan King on Saturday afternoon. When his attention was called to tbo prisoner he was standing on an elevated seat. The prisoner vas hisWing most distinctly. His face was towards him. There was a great disturbance. He did not see books thrown about on Sunday evening. A chorister boy received a violent blow on the head, and had three fits afterwards.
			Mr. Stoddart.-Why were not the rioters given into custody ?
			Mr. SELFZ.-I have nothingto do with that.
			In further cross-examination by Mr. Stoddart the witness said that there were no candles near where the prisoner was. He saw no grease drop from the candies on to the congrega- tion, or on those persons near the prisoner. There were people on each side of the prisoner. They hissed. He waited until the prlsoner hissed loudly a third time, and then he spoke to the inspector.
			The Rev. Bryan King, the rector of St. George's-in-the- Bust, said hc had gone through part of the service on Sunday evening, and had occasion to rend the Creed, and while doing so was very much interrupted. As soon as he got into the reading-desk something was thrown at him which struck him upon the cheek. Ho found it to bo a piece of cake or pudding. He knelt down and was en- gaged in private prayer, when something else was thrown, which struck him on the shoulder. Another missile was hurled at him ; it struck the top of the reading-desk, re- bounded, and fell outside Into the body of the church. There was a slight interruption at the commencement of the service, caused by the removal of a man who was slightly intoxicatedand making a noise. The service continued .after thats with comparative quietude until he began to read the Creed. There was more disturbance at that part of the srvice than at any other. He was then very seriously ln- terruptedxand sould not hear the responses of the chor dis- tmicUhy. ne did not see the prisoner taken ort of the church. HIe was disturbed while reading the whole of the Creed.
			In cross-examinatlun by Mr. Stoddart, the rev, prosecutor said he never disinguished the prisoner at all, nor could he distinguish any other person among the riotes.a The most prominent disturbance took place while he was reading the Creed.
			Charles 'Kay, a police-constablo of the E division, mid he assisted in remnoving the prisoner from the church, and he said if he had done anything wrong he was sorry for it, and would beg pardon. Mr. Baker said he was very sorry for the prlsoner. He did not recollect anything else being said by Mjr. Baker.
			Mr. Stoddart.-fDid you see any prayer-book ln the pri- soner's hand?
			Witness.-I did not.
			Mr. Stoddartsaid if that were his friend's case ithad failed because there was no corroborative proof of the hissing. The statute of Mary required two witnesses to prove the offence.
			Mr. SELrE.-Mr. Smith has not proceeded under the Act of Mary, bat under the Act of Uniformity.
			Ur. 6toddart said his infortuate client, who was a poor uninformed man, hearing of the Tractarian Innovations in the services at St. George's Church, went there out of curiosity to see what was going on. The prisoner had positively declared to him in his instructions that he was not hissing, but only speaking to those alongside of him. HIe thought, considering the fearful distarbance in St. George's Church on Sanday night, it wan impossible to dis- tinguish any particular person hissing. It was a great pity the rector and his friends did not select the ringDleaders in these unhappy disturbances, so disgraoeful to the country
			instead of picking out a poor miserablo man like thc pri-I soner. He would call witnesses who would distinctly prove the prisoner was not hissing. If, after hearing those wit nesses, the magistrate 'should be of opinion the defene set up was not sustained he hoped that the fact of 'he prisoner having been locwed up al night would be taken into consideration in awarding punishment.
			Eli-abeth Ann Thompson, a milliner, of 70, St. George- street; WiUlliam Holding, a painte and George Thorp, a carpenter, were severally culled and said they saw the prisoner, who was net hissing or doing anything at all, and he was dragged out of the church. They differed as to the place where the prisoner was. The second witness sald the prisoner wan used very roughly by Mr. Baker and the police. There were thrceeor four police-constables engaed in removing the prisoner, and one of them forced Ihs knuckles into the prisoner's threat. The first witness fn cross-examination by Mr. Smith, admitted that she had been a witness before against one o2 Mr. King's choristers for illusing a lad named Selby in the church.
			M'Xay was recaUed, and said he was the only policeman engaged In removing the prisoner from the church, and he departed from it in the most quiet manner. There was no occasion to use any force or violence.
			Mr. Hore mid several persons were removed from the church on Sunday night by order of the churchwarden, but no charge was made against them, and they were liberated.
			Mr. SELFE said he would give credit to the witnesses for the defence having spoken the truth, but he beleved they were mistaken, and it was not to be wondered at in the con- fusion which prevailed, moro particularly as they had never seen the man before. It also appeared that 31E1ay only removed one man. That was the prisoner, and he conld not be mistaken. If the prisoner had said that day wh3t he said on Sunday night, that he was very sorry for what he had done, and begged pardon, he thought there might have been an end of the case at once. He entirely agreed with what had been said by Mr. Stoddart, that the ringleaders, the prime movers in these most disgraceful and unhappy disturbances, ought to be selected and punished, and that poor and ignorant men, who in a moment of excitement might be led to hiss or make a disturbance in a church, should not bo fixed upon. He beldeved the prisoner in a moment of excitement did hiss, and it was highly reprehensible to do co, or to express any sign of approbation or disapprobation in a church or any other place of worship. he and his colleague, Mr. Yardley, had made up their minds to punish with great severity any of the ringleaders in these disturbances, or any one interr-uting the servicesifn hechurch. In this case he would teach the prisoner, if he was not already taught by his own good sense, how very improper it was to express approbation or disapprobation in the house of God, and he (31r. Selfe) now made it known to all concerned that offences of this description would in future be severely punithed. There were various Acts of Parhament which visitedirregularitres, and brawling, and indecorous beha. viour in church with heavy fines and long imprisonment. At present he should adjudicate nmder the Act of Eiizabeth. The prisoner was liable to a fine of 100 marks, or six
			months' huprisonment in default of payment. He had for- gotten what a mark was.
			Mr. Smith.-lSs. 4d., Sir.
			Air. SELFP.-Yon, are liable to be fined 561.-rather dear hissing. Vhat are you?
			The Prlsoner.-Iam a journeym3n clolser. I am out of employ now, Sir.
			Mr.SEzLYzEaidhe wouldno' allow the indignation he feltatthe disgraceful conduotof others to prejudicethe prisoner, but he must be permitted to expresa a fervent hope that these disturbances would cease, and that no more provocation would be given on one side or the other. Ele almost despaired, however, in spite of all ho could say, that he should ever hear the fast of the Sb. George's cases. Whenever a case of a bad character was made out a very savero fine or a lengthened imprisonment would be inflicted. Ile thought the justice of this case would be answered by fining the prisoner two marks, or 1t.6s.8d., and in default of paymnent ds months' Imprisonment, and no less.
			The fine was collected by subscription among tho people in and about the court, several boys and girls contributing, and in three minutes the prisoner was liberated.

			Foul peham stated that there were 13 previous convictions against Farrell, who, without exception, was the worst boy they ever had to deal with in Westminster prison, and one agatnst Kennedy.
			The mother of the latter said she had five sons, and none of them had ever been in prison at all.
			FouTheam said that was a very false aserton, as the boy Kenney and a brother were inx the prison at the same time for attempting to pick pockets.
			The ASSITAN5T-JUDGE sentenced Farrell to sL-x years penal servitude, and Kennedy to three years at the reform- atory- for this county at Feltham.

He pleaded "1Guilty." Mr. Cooper appeared on his behalf. The prosecutor carried on business as a beet andI shoe manuLfacturer &amp;c., In Tottenbamo-oDurt-road, and there was reason to believe that the prisoner, who had been in his service between six and sevenL years, had been plunder- ing him dauring the greater part of that time; 401. wvorth of property was found in his bcdroom by thlo policemen in the case, Lambert 68 E.
			The AssisTrA T-JUDoG said it was a very bad case, anid the Court must pass a sentence that would operate as a warning to servants that, however long and successfully they may rob their employers, detection wil follow andl puLnish- ment fall upon them. The sentence upon him was 18 months' hard labour.

			Afx. M'Donnell wa-s counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Sleigh defended the prisoner.
			There were some very curious circumstances in this case. There was no doubt that on the 26th of November last two coats were stolen from 1, Howley-villas, Paddington, and that twvo coats now produced were the same. Oanthe 8th of March the prisoner wams taken into custody with another man on a different charge, and in his possession the officer, Sergeant Boden, 11 D, who had hem, found these two coats, which hehadthatverydayredeemed,and whichhepawnedtho very day they wvere stolen at Mr. Dobree's in Gilbert-street, Oxford-street.

			watch the prisoner and another man, from observing them lotrn uspiciously about houses ini Upper Berkeley-street and Penman-square, an nSy rpace the prisoner was seen. to unlace his boots and go stealthily down an area, the other man keeping watch. In a few minutes the pri. soner rushed up the steps, he taking one ride of the street and his companion the other, the officers in pursuit. On the prioner being takcen he said he bad only been to seo a. Oirl (~o lived there, Emily Dlorman, aLnd the sergeant said,
			'Well, you can easily prove that Iif it bo true." The pri- soner said, " Well, take mne back. ' " No," saidl the officer,
			yetke me back; show me the house;" and the prisoner, havingtsmistaken the right one went to three before be catmeotothat wber&amp;'hohad paid his visit. The prisoner said to the butler, "1Now didn't I come here and ask, for Miss Emily Dorman 1" `"ies " answered the butler, "1you did, but you had no business hers, and no such peron lives base and never did." On the fleer they found a key, with which it seemed the kIt-chen door had been opened, and when the butler, to his surprise, founsd the prisoner Inx the kitchen, be asked about Miss Emily Dlorsman and rana away. The prisoner badl been twice in custody for loitering, and it was believed that he bad served four years' penal servitude, buat the officer who had him then couild not be found.
			The prisoner, a tall, muscular yoang mani, said be could not deny that his character iced been hAd but latterly he bad got an honest living by sitting witha brother and others to artits. The pollce dogged him because they k-new he bad been In trouble, and because he had lived with a young wonan whom he took awayfromoae of them,not now in the force, who left his own wife to live with her, and it was he antd others that had put these officers on to him out of spitea and to getbhim out of the way.
			The officer said the woman was a notorious thief.
			The AsSSLTA.?,T-3JUxos said it the Prisoner's state- ment were true, which it was Impossible to believe, it could not have been in consequencea of any spite of the police that the prisoner and his brother went to an old clothes shop and bought the coats, nor could it have been for the same reasn that he went aown the area. He concurred in the verdict, but should direct inq~uiries to be made, and, if the result of these were such as ho anticipated, it would he the utmost Punishment the law allowed that would be inflicted. As to the defence, hr should consider whether the witnesses should not he prose- cuted for perjury.
			The prisoner said therewzas nopeur in the case, and he was as inncent as any one in court,-Judgment deferred until next sss~ionsu.

			POLIUR!.
			ASSIVoz .lioUs-Tohn Heating, an Irish shoemaker, one half of whose features as obscured by hair, and the other half by dirt, was charged with assaulting Elen Lawler by stabbing her in the face with a knife.
			The prosecutris, the left side of whose face exhibited a huge clrcular patch of sticking plaster, said, B'laso yer Heoneurs, any nanse's Ellen Lawler."
			Mr. Goodman (chidf clerk).-And what Is your husband's Prosecutrix.-Pat Bresshana. (Laughter.)
			Mr. Goodman.-Then, I suppose your name is Bresshanian. Prosecutrix.-Lord, me, yer Honour, my name is Elen Lawler. (Laughter.)
			Mr. Goodman.-How can that be if he's your husband? Your maiden name, you mean. I suppose, vas Lawler?
			Prosecutrix.-Yes, my m&amp;iden nanme, and my name now for though I call Pat my husband we ain't married; but we've lived together a long while, and he's a good hus- band, too.
			Mr. Goodman.-Why did vou not ssy at first that you were not married? Go on with your evidence.
			Prosecntrix.-Well, on Saturday night I was sitting at supper with Bat, when who should como in but Moggy Qunk; so, says I," Sit down, Mog, and have some supper ;" but, yer Honours, she was nasty, and got to words, arnd at last says she, " If you are a woman, come down into the yard and have It out." " Very well, Meg," says I, " 'll come down, cos you know I ain't afraid of you " and she says " No, I knows that, I knows you are too good a woman for me " and that's right, yer Honours, because, tho' 'm a quiet woman, I can stick� up for myself lik a goDd'un, only I didn't want to hurt ber nor nobody. (Laughter.) Well, when we got downstairs we quieted, and we wasn't a-going to fight; but there was a mob at the door, and that there prisoner there made a rush at me and gave me a job in the moiith with his fist which loosened all my teeth, and then he iobbed at me again with something in his hand which I took to be a knife, and stabbed me in the face. io I cas out, " Pat," says I, " he's made a hole in my face with a knife, and Pm kilt intirely !" (laughter); and then down I went, while Pat dashed out and collaed him. The hole ain't quite through my cheek, but It's a whacker, and I hopes your worship will give me purtection. (Laughter.)
			Pat Bresshanan said,-When that man stabbed my wife- MIr. Goodman.-She says she is not your wife, though she lives with you.
			Witness.-So she does; and an honest woman she is.
			Sir R. �ARDEmm.-Wby don't you make an honest woman of her?
			Wltness.-I don't mean in that way; but I mean that she's too honest to meddle with anybody's business.
			Mr. Goodman.-She can fight well, 4t all events, accord- ing to her own confession.
			Witness-She's a regular good'un, yer Honour; she's a rale beauty, and no mistake.
			Sir R. CABDELS.-Then, why don't you marry her?
			Witness.-WeD, I will, yer Honour, I wilL But about this here prisoner. When'I rushed out upon him he struck me, and I'm suro I felt a knife in his hand.
			Prisoncr.-My Lord, it wasn't a knife at ali, and but for the drink that was in my head I shoudn't have done it. That vwoman had been throwlng some water over me just before, and when I went out again I took a little poker with me, and I hit her with that. It was a very little one, yer honour, but sharp at the end.
			Sir R. CADENS.-A poker would not have cut like a knife. However, knife or poker, I shall send you to prison for 21 days.
			Prosecutrir.-And, oh ! yer Honour, won't you bind him over to keep the peace towards me?
			Sir R. CABDZmN.-The police will protect you. rd rather bhid you over not to live with that man again till yen are married.
			Prosecutrix.-And, faith, yer worship, rId not object to that.

			DE. LBoRoUc;H-sTRxEBT.-Alfred Rogers, of 217, King's- road, Chelsea, a commezclal traveller, was charged with disorderly conduct and causing a mob to assemble in the Haymarket.
			M'Bean, 232 C, said he saw two men wrangling together at a quarter past 1 a.m. in the Haymarket, near where he was on special duty at a cafi. One struck the other, and 'he man struck wanted to give the other in charge,but he parted them, and told them to go away. The defendant now came up, and asked why he did not taLk the chare. He repled that they were the persons to complain, andknew whero to go if they wished to do so. He next told defendant not to annoy or bother him, but to go to the station if he had any complaint to make; and defendant said he was a cowardly rascal not to take the man's charge. A mob had sbleen now gottogaenther,ennd hde, calling on another con- stale,tok dfenan ino cstdy.Hewas not drunk.
			The defendant in answer, said be sawa very big man strike a very litte one, and the policeman saw the same. The ISttle man complained and gave the other in charge, but the policeman would not take him. All the did himself was to cal on the constable to take the charge of the little man, and to tell him it was his duty to do so. The pollcee man, white vith passion, threatened to take him for ob- structing him, as he said, in his duty, and roughly laying hold of him at the same moment tore one of his buttons off. He mentioned this to show how roughly he was handled.
			Mr. Bs,A.DoT.-1t was wrong to attempt to explain to the policeman in the street what his duty wa. He has his oficers to teU him that.
			The defendant said he merely made the remark which occurred to him at the moment. Two gentlemen were pre- sent who could testify to all that occurred, and he caled
			Mr. Leopold Ackland, of 9, Pentonville-road, who con. firmed the defence as stated, and said he advised the de- fendant to go quietly, which he did.
			MIr. BEADON observed that if people who bad com- plaints against the poUce would but go to the station-houses and make them3to the inspectors he was sure they would meet with every attention i but It was very indiscreet, to say the least of it, to mterfere with a policeman on duty. With these remarks he should certainly dismiss the charge.
			Mr. Rogers, as he left the bar, declared his determination to make complaint against the constable for excess of daty.

			WESTS rHsN.-Walter Philps, a respectably attirod young man. was charged with being concerned in a burglary and extensive robbery at the house of Alr. Spiers, 3, Crom. well-lane, Brompton.
			Inspector Firman, of the A reserve, attached to the B division, intimated that the prosecutor in this case was at Folkestone, but he (Mr. Firoan) had sufficient evidence to procure a remand. Hie had present the pawnbroker to whom the prisoner had offered in pledge some of the missing proDerty, and a man who had seen the prisoner near the scene of t'be burglary but a few minutes before it had occurred.
			Tho inspector was then sworn, and stated that between the hours of 9 and 10 on the night of Friday week the house of Mr. Spiers was entered through an enoccupied house adjolning. Tho padlock on an iron gate w hich secured the top window had been wrenched off, several ladies' drcssing- cases and a gentleman's dressing-case carried from the dress. ing-room to the servants room, and there broken open and rifled of their contents and a quantity of jewels carried away; the value of the stolen property being estimated at at least 1501. On the Saturday following the robbery information reached him that a portion of the property In adamaged state had been oEfered in pledge, and witness, with Sergeant Lnckyer, of the detectlve foree went yesterd'ay morning, accompanied by the pawnbroirer (who had been put to considerable trouble in the matter), to a place where it was supposed the prisaner vws, and there apprehended him on the pawnbroker identifying him as the nan who had offered somne of the property in pledge.
			Frederick Gadwort, .assistant to r. George Attenberogh, pawnbroker, of Fleet-street, said that in the afternoon of Saturday week the prisoner came into the shop and offered him in pledge 10 diamonds wrapped in a dirty plece of grocer's paper, having, previously to showing witness the diamonds, pnt something from the paper into his mouth. He said he wanted 22h. for the diamonds, end witness, seeing they were worth mare than he asked-vLs, 2SI., inquired how he became posseased of them * he said they were his own pro- party, and witness then inquired whether he was a dealer, to which he at first replied in the nega.:ive, but shortly afterwards in the afirmative. Witness then asked him what they welghed. lIe replied that he did not know and witness observed it wa3s very strange that a dealer shionld not know their weight but should set a price upon them; for which the prisoner endeavoured to account by saying that ho only went bywh:at he gave farthem. Witness found the stones weighed 3n corats, and he vws of opminon the stones came from an enameUed cross, part of which be produced, as crosses of that description centai:ned from 10 to 12 such stones. After he had weighed the dia- monds he noticed that there were among them two inferior stones not worth above 31 a carat, while the others were worth about 8l. a carat. He did not at all like the prisoner's repLies to his various questions, and in order to test the truth of his statement he took the two inferior atones away and asked prisoner what he wanted for the other eight, and he allowed as much for them as though they had been goed stones, whien fully convinced witness that he Wbe not a dealer and something was wrong about the matter. Directly afterwards another man came in with some gold mounting (produced). Witness fonnd thls matched the diamonds exactly, and being sure by this that there was some coanexion between the men he sent for a policeman. It was raining very hard at the time, and no policeman could be found, and while one was being sought after the prisoner took up the diamonds from the counter and went away, and theother man followed him Immediately, leaving the mounting, which witness refused to give him.
			The prisener was remanded for a week.

			lr. NORtTOwN observed that robberies of this description were becoming so frequent that ndies, the persons on whom they were generally practied, should be very careful indeed in answering Etran,gers in the streets, or, when they dild an- swer, to keep at a respectful distance firom the persons ask5ing them. He had no doubt whatever th-t the prisoner Was an expert thief, s stated by the constable, and should therefore commit him to three mouths' hard labour at Wandsworth House of Correction.

			FIRE IN THE CITY.-Yesterday morning for several boors the greatest alarm prevaUed in the neighbour- hood of the General Post-office owing to the raging of a fire, which could not be extlngaished until property of consider. able value was laid in ruins, and tbo lives of the whole of the inmates greatly jeopardized. Tho premises in which the disaster commenced belonged to MIr. J. Cole, a licensed victualler, and were known by the sign of the Coach and Horses Tavern, situate at No. 133, Aldersgate-street. The building, four stories high, excluslve of the basement was jolned on either side by houses equally lofty-on the north by the extensive prin'lng-offices belonging to Messrs. Maiben and Bingham, and on the south by the haberdashery warehouse of Mr. J. W. Gales, while nume- rous other houses abutted on the rear. The fire was dis. covered by a police-constable of the clty force, who saw smoko issuing from one of the wtndows, but at that time there was no appearance of flame at the outside. The officer at once gave an alarm, and sent off for the Royal Society's escapes stationed at Aldersgate-street and Chea side. In abDut ffve minutes the two escapes arrived, when the conductors found immense sheets of flame coming from nearly every window. The escapes having boen pitched in front of the house, Haskell, one of the conductors, ascnded, and fought his way through the flames at the moment tho affrighted inmates were screaming at the secoad floor win- dow, and the fire was nearly seizing them at the hack of their bodies. Easkell managed to get Into the room and pulled out a woman, whoselegs were hanging out of a win- dow, and her head hanging back in the apartment, the poor creature being nearly suffocatedL The conductor having brought down this person, handed her to the neighbours, HUe ascended twioe again, and at tho risk of losing his own life he got out of the blazing bailding two persons-3dr. Cole a brother of the landlord, and MA King, tho landlady's brother. It having been rumoured that another man was in the back room of the seoond floor, Conductor Briggs ascended his escape, forced his way through the fire in the front roam, and having ganed the back, became fairly surronndea with fire, and had the greatest difficulty in getting back to his escape. In fact, the populace cried out to Haskell to get up his machine, and bring out, if possible, his brother conductor, for the flames were then extending some feet out of 'he fron' windows. Briggs, however, hbad managed to get to his escape just as the top had taken fixe. Eortusately, both men, although nearby stifled, reached terra firnua Sn safely. IJpon reaching the bottom of their escapes the courageous fellow;s were louldly cheered by the neighbours. A good supply of water having beens obtained, the engines were set to wvork, and after a consideratble quan- tity of property had been destroyed the fire V;as got under. -Erprcss.

			EASTER AMUSEMLENTS, &amp;c-
			DRURY-LANE THEATRE.
			The entertainments prepared last night to inaugurate the Eastex holydays comprised Mr. Wallace's opera of Mlaritana, which, since its first production at this theatre-November 15, 1845- has preserved Its popularity unimpaired; and a " BaUet Comique," by Mr. Flexmcre, called 2he Spanish Danscrs. or Two too many, originaUy composed for Madrid. The house was crowded.
			Now that the two great Italian lyric establishments ire on the eve of commencing operations, the announcement of a new operatic speculation, with an English company, at the third important metropolitan theatre, may, perhaps, startle, rather than gratify, those whose duty it is to report on the musical performances abounding at this par- ticular season of the year. Dr. Pech, however, a professor of acknowledged repute, has got together a good working " troop," including principal singers of considerable talent, a chorus of more than respectable pretensions, and an orchestra of 50 performers-which last, seeing that not one of its members is engaged at either of the Italian Opera- honses, may reasonably create some degree of surprise at the musical resources which the city of London can boast. In the ranks of this instrumental body were observed M. Lavigne, one of the Belgian exportations of the late NL Junlien, an oboist of deserved eminence; Yr. Tyler, a ola- rionetist with a tone only inferior to that of Mr. Lazarus ; Mr. Svendsen, principal flute of the Crystal Palace Band, associated with Signor Antonio Minasi, one of the most experienced flautists before the public ; the brothers Hennen, excellent violinists ; Mr. Beresford, a capital player on the double-bass ; and other performers of decided ability. Dr. Pech, the "etrepreneur, himself pre- sided in the orchestra; and a very effective performance of the overture augured well for what was to follow. The principal singers were Mliss Dyer (or, to use the conven- tional idiom, Madame Haigh Dyer), to whom was allotted the part of Maritana; Miss Emma Hey- wood, who played Lazarillo, the page ; Mr. 0. Dn- rand (Don Jose) ; Mr. Hlenry Haigh (Don COasar de Basan); and Mr. Borrani, the original King of Spain,whose impersonation of that august though erring potentate differs now very little in its salient characteristics from what It was 15 years ago, when Afaritana, the experiment of a musician comparatively unknowvn to this country, with aU well-merited success, hardly authorized bim in be- lieving that in course of time he would attain so distin- guished a rank among the *lramatic composers of Great Britain. These, together with some tolerably competent performers in the subordinate parts, gave a very fair and in several instances highly satisfactory representation of Mfr. Wallace's popular work, which gratified the audi- ence to such an extent that no less tban five pieces were unanimouslyencored-viz., "Alas those chimes" (Lazarillol.
			very sweetly sung by Miss Emma Heywood, who has a fin: toned " mezzo-soprano" voice, with some legitimate " contralto" notes ; the trio " Turn on old Time" (Don nesar, Don Jos6, and Lazarillo) ; " Yes, let me like a soldier fall (Don Casar), which Mr. Haigh delivered with appropriately mzartial enthusiasm; " There is a flower that bloometh" (Don OCsar), a ballad that afforded the same promising vocalist an opportunity of exhibiting his telling voice and earnest expression in a totally opposite (and much more attractive) style ; and "Scenes that are brightest" (Mlaritana), the gracsful and melodious air with which the third and last act of the opera begins-sung by Miss Dyer with irreproachable taste and feeling. These were the striking features of the performance; but many other passages were loudly applauded, and none more deservedly so than the fortune-telling scene (" Pretty Gitana "), set by Air. Wallace in his most sparkling manner, and both sung and acted with such spirit as to elicit unqualified approval for Miss Dyer, whose rendering of the romance, " 'Tis the harp in the air" (Act I.) was equally happy,andjdeserved an ericore just as much as the song that later in the evening more com- pletely hit the sympathies of her hearers. The concerted pieces and finales were on the whole well executed, and the rondo finale, " 'W,ith rapture glowing," skilifully vocalized by the heroine of the evening, brought down the curtain with unanimous plaudits, folowed by a summons for the chlief perforners, who crossed the stage amid renewed tokens of satisfaction.
			The Spanish Dancer.s-adircitissemcnl of theslightest pos- sible texture-was yrincipally instrumental in exhibiting the admirable talents of Mr. Flexmore-who, by the way, is just as good a dancer as a mimic, and whose parody, never extravanant while always humorous and diverting, of Senora Perea Nera, won *' golden opinions." There were several " pas seuls" and " pas d'ensenmble"-and among the most entertalning,Ia " bolero," and a " comic dance"-by Mr. Elexmore and his eara sposa, Jladamo TFlexmore Auriol.
			Previous to the opera the band performed the National Anthem. The other operas announced by Dr. Pech for the present week are the Trorastnre and the evergreen Bohemian Girl. Meanwhile an English version of M. Halevy's Meeusquetaires de la Roine, is, we understand, in prepara- Meon.

			HAYMARKET THEATRE.
			Mr. Tom Taylor's comedy, the Overland Route, which has proved one of the most attractive pieces brought out for many years, was last night foUowed by a "fairy romance," written by Mr. H. J. Byron, and entitled The Pilgrim of Love. This piece, wlhich is intended to celebrate the Easter holydays, is founded upon the story of "Prince Ahmed al Kamel," in Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhamrbra.
			With this story,wi-ch is a graceful compound of elements that in some shape oz other will be found in many Oriental tales, some of our readers are perhaps unacquainted. Prince Ahmed is the son ofa Moorish King of Granada Imprisoned by his father in the Generalife Palace, and intrusted to a sage named Eben Bonabben, who is forbidden, on pain of his life, to make the Prince acquainted in any manner with the passion of love. A prediction that love wiU cause great danger to the heir of Granada is the cause of this incarcera- tion, and of course th3 pains taken to guard the young gentle- manproveutterlyabortive. EbenBonabben,bothfromduty and inclination, refrains from discoursing on the forbidden theme, but, unfortunately, in his desire to amuse the prince, he instructs him In the language of birds, and the feathered warblers are loud in sheir expositions of the tender passion. The dove, above aU others the bird of love, becomesAibmed's confidant, and tells him of a lovely princess whom he has seen In the course of his travels, describing her in such glowing terms that the prince writes her a letter, which is at once taken by the dove to the place of its deatinatIon. By the same messenger the lady sends back her po)rtrait, but unfortunately the poor bird is shot on his way home, and drops dead at the feet of Ahmed, without having revealed the spot where the surpassing beauty resides. Armed with the portrait. the prince escapes from his palace, taking as his companion a sage owl, who is to assist him In discovering the retreat of the princess. The owvl introduces him to a raven, and the raven refers him to a parrot, who has often visited foreign Courts, and at once recognizes the portrait as that of the Princess Alde_onda 'if Toledo. Towards the ancient city the prince at once directs his steps, and employs the parrot as his ambassador to the princess, who, like himself, has been shut up by a stern parent in a splendid palace, so as to be debarred from all comnunication with man- kind. She has treasuired the letter brought to her by the ill-starred dove, and shereceives the parrot with delight, informing him that she is to be released on the morrov, the seventeenth anniversary of her birthday, and that her hand will be bestowved on the victor at a tournament, held by her father, the King of Toledo. These tidings, brought by the parrot to the prince, sound dismaly in the ears of the latter, for he has never been trained to the use of arms ; but the owl conducts him to a cavern, where he finds a suit of magic armour and a magic steed, the virtue of which will cornpensate for all defi- ciencies. He presents himself at the lists, when a new difficulty arises. The IKing of Toledo is a Christian,and allows none but Christians to contend for the hand of his daughter,-a provision which prevents Ahmed, as a Moslem, from taking part in the tournament. Under these circum- stances his magic horse does him more harm than good, for he is ridiculed by some of the knights assembled for the tournay, and when lie attempts to resent their Insults he lets louse a power over which he has no control. The demoniac horse ov?ertbrows everybody, including the King himself, and, when he has brouglht his master into universal disgrace, sneaks bask with him into the cavern whenc3 he was originally brought. In the meanwhile the misfortunes of the" lilgrim of Love" -as Abmed cals himself-bave caused Aldegonda to fall seriously ill, and her Royal father issues a proclamation to the effect that he will reward with the richest jewel in his treasury any physician who vill effiect the cure of his darling child. Ahmed, as might be expected, presents him- self In disguise, and the Princess, who recognizes hiln, at once recovers her good looks. For his reward, thus fairly earned, Ahmed, Instructed by theowl, claims apiece of carpet, which has long lain nisregarded in the treasury, but which onco belonged to King Sclomon, and is endowed with wondrous virtue. On this mEgic carpet, as on a flying steed, he flies with the Princess to his own kingdom, and, as the match is by no means a bad one, her father subsequently pardons the stratagem which has been practised upon him.
			This story has beea followed by Mr. Byron without any essential alteration, beyond an economy in the employment of feathered agents, and the pencil of Mr. Fenton and his assistants has made it the vehicle of a beautiful series of Spanish views. Every scene is a striking landscape or anl elaborate Moorish interior, while the journey of Ahmed from Granada to Toledo Is represented by a moving panorama, comprisinig views of Seville and Cordova. The costumes are as perfect as the pictures, and It would be difficult to find thres more characteristic figures than the Moorish 1Prince, as played by Mrs. Bucklngham White, the Aldegonda of Miss M .Ternan, ani the King of Toledo,dressed up as an ideal Spaniard, by Mr.Conmpton. The piece, on which so much choice ornr:inient has been bestowed, is somewhat heavy. Called in the bills, not a "burlesque," but a
			fairy romance," it is free from vulgar slang, while Ir sparkles with much of Mr. Byron's usual pleasantry, but still it may be doubted whether the middle path he has chosen is one which might always be safely foUowed. His treatment has enouigh of the parody in its character to prevent the excitemsnt of a serious interest, bnt the work is not suffciently comical to raise a frequent laugh. No doubt It will prove attractive as a spectacle, but it can scarcely be accepted as a sample of Mr. Byron's peculiar gaenis, so fully displayed in his fornier burlesques at the Olympic and the Strand. General applause followed the descent of the curtain.

			M�E ADELPHT.
			Mr. Webster was honoured with a bumper house last night, although his bill of fare was nolther new nor varied. It consisted of two cld disbes-The Dead Heart and TheFair One wii tht Golden Ledes. Both are so well known that It is quite unnecessary to say a single word abont elther. 2The Dead Heart wa: performed for the 62d time, and Its scenes of gloomy misery seemed to make a deep impression upon, the audience, especially that portiozsf It w ocu-
			Pied theunpper galleries. When the curtain rose on the dnal taUcau-the guillotine In the Place do Grkve-you might have heard a pin drop. A real execution could not have produced a greater effect. How strlking the contrast pre- sented by ?L-.Planche's sparkling extravaganzaI What with admirable acting, excellent singing, beautiful dresses, and br lliant scenery, The Pair One with he Goldcu Locks, though written we know not how many years ago, and performed on almost everystage in London, wasalmostas good as new.

			Mr. Harris, in has Easter carte at this theatre, has had an eye to tho most varied tastes. In the first place, Mr. Phelps commenced last night in the M11an of the World, a round of his most celebrated characters-an entertainment solid enough for the gravest playgoers ; and for the more frivolous or pure holyday-makers there is a fairy extra- vasanra to follow, entitled the Splphlide, which as it is 'from the pen" of Mr. W. Brough, may b sup- posed to be very amusing, and which certainly, as far as acting and skilful minze en seine are concerned, is as elegant a trifle as ever served to digest a regular five-act tragedy or comedy. Of so well-known a performance as Mr. Phelps's Sir Pertinax Macsycophant it is unnecessary to say more than that it was as thoroughly appreciated by his new audience as by any of those who have so long had a sort of monopoly of him. All his great points told well, and though much of the satire is fortunately out of date, when a shot did hit us moderns home a good round of laughter never failed to confess halcsus. Sir Pertinax, for instance, at election time did not mind giving 201. for a peruke ; but most of those who last night heard him boast of such generosity, as he called it, must have called to mind that at Wakefield, scarce a twelvemonth ago, hair- brushes were selling for twice the money, though Queen Victoria's Commissioners seemed to have viewed the late transaction in a more severe light. Such coincidences and in the illMn of the World there are many otbers vastly stinmulate the interest of an audience, and by the audience of last night none of them were missed. Mr. Phelps was twice called before the curtain, and had certainly no reason to complain of the warmth of his reception, on the boards so lately trodden by a great rival. The .Syiphide, " a fairy extravaganza," by Mr. W. Brough, on close examination turns out to be our very old friend the Mountain Sylph, an English opera, by Mr. Barnett. The only change is, that Mr. Brough has supplied a comic dialogue, fu3l of puns, more remarkable, of course, for their audacity than any other quality; and in the d6nozmcnt the sylph, instead of fading awav, Undine fashion, under the spell of the ecarf, is simply transformed into a practical housewife, more Intent on buttons and the hashing of yester- day's joint than the zephyr and the butterfly chases which so distracted her mortal spouse. Miss C. Leclercq was the sylph, and a more graceful and agile sylph fairydom never produced. The best pieces of Mr. Barnett's music are pre- served, particularly "Farewell to the Mountain," admir- ably sung by Miss Louise Keeley, who is the Donald of the extravagan7a, and"This maglc-wove scarf," sung by Mr. Shore, whose1burlesqueof Hela adds very considerably to the amusement of the piece. Admirable uso is made of the ballet resources of the theatre, aud the final tableaux, wh'ch owes much more to the clever grouping of masses than any splendid scenic effect, was loudly applauded.

			OLYMPIC.
			While the other managers of the London theatres have vied with each other in producing new pieces, Messrs. Robson and Emden, of the Olympic, have celebrated Easter by a novelty of an opposite kind. 'When they closed before Passion-week there were fonr pieces in their bill, but when they reopened last night they left one out; while the other three-viz., Tom Noddu'sSccret, Uncle Zachary, and B.B.- remained as before. WVhen the house is so well attended that the musicians play under the stage, to afford extra room in the orchestra for the audience, there is no occasion to bring out Easter spectacles; but even a crowded audience may have too much for their money, and therefore the Olympic bill has been judiciously curtailed.

			LYCEU3I.
			This theatre, which has opened for a short Easter season previous to the performance of French opera, offered a great attraction to holyday-goers in the first representation by a professional company of the new burlesque of the Forty TJhicevs, written by seven authors for the amateur perform- ance of the " Savage Club," and played before Her Majesty and the Court. The performances commenced with a new comio drama entitled Next of Kin, a piece of slight preten- sions. The burlesque introduced several popularfavourites, among whom may be mentioned Miss Lydia Thompson, Miss Clara St. Casse, Miss Kate Saxon, Mr. Tilbury, Mr. Emery, and Mr. S. Calhaem. The fashionable audience that witnessed the amateur performance of the Forty Threves may probably desire to see how professional actors treat the same zabject, whUe the public not present at the Court per- formance will no doubt hb curious to witness a burlesque which was honoured by soillustrious an audience. MiassLydia Thompson was last night the bewitching captain of the Forty Thieves, and her dance in the cavern before the assembled brigands, and a burlesqued sword combat with her rebel lieu- tenant Hassarae (Mr. Emery) excited afurorc, not only among the lawless band,but also among the audience. Mr. J. Neville was AlI Baba (played by Mr. Byron at the Savage Club per- formauce), Cogia Baba was Miss Eliza Travers (played by Mr. F. Talfourd), and Morgiana was Mr. S. Calbaem (played by Mr. R. B. Brough). Miss Clara St. Casse made a pretty Ganem, and Miss Kate Saxon was an unexceptionable Mirza. Mr. Tilbury was unctiously humourous as the cobbler Mastapha, and Mr. Calbaem'a Morgiana was exceedingly comical and diverting. A good deal of the verbal wit with which the burlesque abounds was lost upon an Easter audience, but there are jokes for aU comprehensions. The puns are as plentiful indeed as plums in a Christmas pudding, and they take a wide range from the felicitous to the excruciating. Tbe thieves are repre- sent-ed by the comps de ballet, and their evolutions contri. buted greatly to the success of the piece. The performances concluded with the Middy Ashore, in which Miss Lydia Thompson enchanted her admirers with her sailors horn- pipe, and her graceful and vivacious assumption of the cha- racter of the young sailor. The house was fairly attended, but was not in all respects " a bumper."

			STRAND.
			A very broad burlesque, founded on 2lh Millcr aLnd his Men, is here the Easter attractlon. Grindorff, that re- nowned robber cbief, whose dread deeds several rising generations of play-goers have seen and shuddered at, becomes so droll a stage villain when sketched by Miss Saunders, that nobody who has seen him in his new character can for the future recognize his ancient pre- tensions to the tragic. The well-known story is followed pretty closely, and wbat is wanting in novelty of incident is supplied by the startlingly absurd way in which old charac- ters are pourtrayed and old incidents treated. Among the revivals the most effective part is that of Ravina, the miller's " neglected one," a lady whose slightly dilapidated charms are muade the wt -st of by Mr. James Rogers. Her mourn- fal retrospect, In the robbers' cave, of the days when she was " young and innocent," provoked peals of laughter:-
			"5I was lovely then. My auburn hair
			- Reached in romantic ringlets downm to here,,"
			The ringlets aforesaid being of the fiercest red, and the locus in quo somewhere about the ankles. Mr. James Bland is Kelmar, " the oppressively virtuous elderly cot- tager," father of the heroine; Miss Simpson, the Tra- velling Count, with attendant tiger, capitally made up by Miss Marie Wtlton, Mr. J. Clarke enacts the peasant lover, and Miss Bnfton, the village belle. With this strong cast, formed of actors and actresses well trained in the Strand school of burlesque, it is hardlynecessary to say that the Mliller end his Mlen does not flag, and that the fun is uproarious. The names of the authors (Mr. F. Talfourd and Mr. H. J. Byron) also give too full assurance that of ver- bal quips and cranks there is no lack. The piece is double-barreUed and full of puns to bursting, some of them of rather a doubtful k-ind; but as the two authors were called upon the stage after the performance and made their bows amid applause, we may assume that their manifold offences against the Queen's Eng- lish were condoned by the audience. The dances introduced during the burlesque if not refined, were vgorous, the songs were of the unclassical and familiar school, and the last scene displayed, amid many-coloured lights, some resplendent heathen goddeses, whose connex- ion wilth the AtiUer- and his .Me,, could not be anite satisfac- torily accounted for, but whose appearance and disappear- ance closed the burlesque in a blaze of giory.

			ST. JAMES'S HALL..
			For Easter Monday the directors of the Monday Popular Concerts had provided a concert suitable to the occasion, a sort of holyday concert in some respects. The programme, vocal and instrumental, with the exception of Dussek's admirable sonata in B flat for plano and violin (played by Mr. Lindsay Sloper and M. Saitan), was exclusively devoted to English music. The well-trained choir of the London aed Madrigal Union. under the direction of Mr. Land, gave a madrigal from Mr. Maefarren's Charles the Second; Horsley's glee, "By Celia's ar. bour ;" and Bishop's "Blow gentle gales," the first two being encored. Mr. Sims Reeves introduced three sons, two of which, "In vain I would forget," from r.
			oenry Smart's Bertha? and "Lovely malden," from Mr. Balfe's Rose of Cast,e, he was compelled by unanimous desire to repeat: the third, "I wander by my dear one's door," one of Mr. T. L. Hatton's most recent and graceful compositions, only escaping the same penalty on account of Its tranouil and unpretending character. Mr. Santley, our young and rising bass, who is rapidly attaining the hlghest honours of his profession, was no less successful in two songs-Mr. WaUace's " Bell-ringer" (a " emn" in Its way), and a setting of SheUey's dirge, " Rough wind that moanest loud" (from the VecaZ flius- trations of Shelley), both loudly redemanded and re- peated. To conclude, Miss Eyles, an esteemed member of the London Glee and MadrIgal Union, besides assisting in the glees, sang Mr. G. A. Osborne's graceful air, "The Dew- drop and the Rose," end " Near Woodstock Town," one of the oldest and quaintest of the English ditties from Mr. William Chappell's inexhaustible collection.
			In addition to Dussek's sonata, the instrumental pro- grammne included Mr. Alfred Mellon's extremely clever quartet, In G, for stringed instrurnments (1I. Sainton, Hferr Ries, Mr. Doyle, nud Signor Piattl); Mr. 3acfarren's spirited and masterly trio, in B, for pLano and wind instruments (Mr. Lindsay Sloper, M Sainton and Signor Piatti); and Professor Bennett's " musicl aketcbes," for pianoforte alone, entitled Tke Lake, tae mijZ strc, and tfhe Fira-isn (Mr. LindsLy Sloper), which, 2ZR6 dof a Pmtwy tacn, runad
			as fresh, sparkling, and 2aow as if they had been only written yesterday. All of these were listened to wlth attenton, sad applauded wvith enthusiasm. Mr. Benedict w,as, as usual, accompaist-a post in which he could wiath difficulty be replaced. Altogether, the enter. tainment was one of the most essentially " popular"' oE the Monday Popular Concerts; and, so appeared to think teh large auldience that crowded every part of St. James'.sll.]

			CRYSTAL PALACE.
			Easter Monday is generaly almost as great a day at the Crystal Palace as Good Friday Itself. It seemed, however, too much to expect that on both these occasions the weather would prove fine; and accordingly yesterday it was as raw, blustering, and inclement as is often seen even in holyday festivals in England. Yet, notwithstanding these draw- backs, there was a very numerous attendance of visitors, and, though not so many as under more propitlous circum- stances might fairly have been expected, the building wsa stiU wel filled, and all around the orchestra almost inconveniently crowded. The gardens, too, were not without numerous parties of admirers, though, as might be expected, the wind was far too cold and rough to encourage maore than a hardy few to venture on the terraces. Thus, owing to the most unusual backwardness of the season, the Crystal Palace, with the ordinary run of shilling visitors is shorn of at least half its attractions. In the building, however, a programme was expressly provided for the occa- sion, which, if not planned on that scale of libe- rality usual at Norwood, was at least sufficient to occupy the attention and amuse the listeners while in per- formance. Of course the feature of the day was the singing of Piccolomini, who in "a Btti, batti," and " I dreamt that I dwelt," was listened to with rapt attentlon, and ap- -plauded enthusiastically. The united performances of the bands of tho Palace and Coldstream Guards seemed also very popula,X and was, in fact, better calculated to interest those wvho, fromtheir distance, were prevented hearingi the charming vocalist with as much distinctness as they wished With such aids and some excellent organ performances by ar. Coward, the day was got through well enough, and between the Fine Arts Cousts and Tropical Department there seemed plenty to see and he pleased with. The latter department is now in most beautiful order, and in itself wiould wel repay a long day's visit to Norwood. The Fine Arts Courts, too, seem grov in more and more popular with each succeeding year, and there must be a very smaUl attendanca indeed at Norwood when the visitor does not find them always with their own particular knots of admirers. It is, indeed, very possible that these courts ma.y not have realized-as what could realize !-the extravagant expectations which were enter- tained when they were first established, hut they have net been without their great value nevertheless. The Greek and Roman and Rennaissance Courts are full of silent teachers who never tire, and It is not possible that thousands end thousands can daily gaze on the most perfect types of artistic beanty without deriving advantages not less important, per- haps, for not being instantly developed. The vslue of the statues and works of art in these respects is now to be still further utilized, and it is intended to establish at the build- ing a kind of school for seleet classes of both sexes. The ad- vantages of the plan wil, of course, include free admission to the Palace for both teachers and pupils on the days of abttending the classes, and every care has been used in the ap- pointment of a committee and other details to test the ex- periment under the most favourable ausoices. How far
			t wiul prove a successful one remains to ho seen. The beautiful china and glass court lately belonging to Mr. Hawkins has passed into the hands of Messrs. Barcinott and Banfiald, who have now entirely re- arranged its colection of fine-art works in glass and porcelain, so that it stil forms, as heretofore, one of chief attractions of the building. The Ceramic Court, which now containS some of the finest specimens of this desorintion of art-manufacture that have ever probably been brought together in one place, has been further enriched during the winter with some of linton's superborepro- ductsEni of the majolica. Some of these examples are the iost important in size and the richest in colouring and exeoution that have ever been produced in this country. The Royal WVorcester Works have, also con- tributed fresh objects in that exquisite species of manuf.acture so paculiarly their own, the Limoges eusmeis. There are also some beautiful specimens of fine porcelain work from Copeland's, and for those who take ann interest in this must artistic branch of manufacture-a mnanuiacture in which this country is fast distancing all competitors-no eonrtwiil be found better worthy of examni- nation than that which contains the cecramic ware at Nor- wood. During the whole of yesterday it was crowded with visitors.
			The Elijoh performance takes place On Friday, Mlay 4, instead of Wednesday. Mlay 2, as at first inadvertently printed in the programme for the season.

			COLOSSEUM.
			This deservedly popular place of amusement was, as usual on all holyday occasions, weU crowded yesterday. The en- tertainments, which of one kind or the other keep up an incessant round of amusements from 12 till nearly 5 in the day, and from 7 tiU nearly 11 in the evening, were entirely altered for yesterday's fresh season. For the commence- ment the Misses Terry gave one of their popular drawing. room entertainments, which, with its lively dialogue and easy impersonation of characters, promises to have a long run. Some admirable glees, madngals, and part songs were given by the St. George's choir with considerable effect, and a popularized lecture on the general principles of science, by Dr. Bachhoffner, followed. One of the most amusing of the entertainments consists in a dashing, rattling, half musical and descriptive series of character sketches, which have lately grown into such vogue at all places of amuse- ment. Mr. Foster gave his at the Colosseum with all the spirit and bonhommic which always mark his efforts in these interludes, and was rewarded with unanimous ap. plause for his care. In addition to these sources of attrac- tion there were a set of new dissolving views, with vocal illustrations, which were both really excellent; a lecture on magic, natural and physical ; the exhibition of the new oxyhydrogen microscope, and a gallery of stereoscopic and photographic pictures of the best kinds. As a matter of course those old stock, but apparently never fading, objects of interest, the dioramas of Lisbon, London, and Paris, arc shown, and seem as nsw as ever; and the Swiss cottages, mountain torrents, &amp;c., command their prescriptive meed of admiration. On the whole, the programme here is varied and excellent, and quite maintains the reputation which the Colosseum has held under its new management of beig among the best and cheapestof the metropolitan amusements.

			MADAME TUSSAUD'S.
			No matter what the weather may be, as sure as bolyday folks are abroad, so sure is Madame Tussaud's of being fell during aU the hours that her interesting exhibition Is open to the public. Yesterday proved no exception to this rule end the wax.works, in aU their departments, were crowded, from the Napoleon Room, where such valuable rehcs and mementos of tho rise of our present ally's great predecessor are exhibited, to the Chamber of HIonrors, where are other mnementos, yet more startling. To speak truth, howrever, the claims of the last-namod sombro apartment seem paramount on the general m=ass of visitors, who look upon thesrevensog's amusement as incomplete unless they are chilled to the very marrowv by the gloom of this most sinister compartment. But the collection has far mere numerous and bettor attractions than these afforded by a survey of these homicidal relies. Among other additions made to the general exhibition is the historical gallery of the line of English monarchs, which, though at present only shown down to Rufus, is, we are informed, complete, even to her present Majesty. This we should say wiU prove a most attractive addltion to the collection, and one which in in- terest must be as lasting as those celebrated groups of Napoleon and his Generals, Mary Queen of Scots, &amp;c. It only requires one change of the present system to make this the most frequented, as it is the most popular exhibition of its kind in London and that is one uniform charge at the door to admit to all part of the coUection-Napoleon Room Chamber of Honrors, and all. The system of separaite charges to different rooms in an exhibition has never yet answered; and the Colosseum, which Is a striking case in point, now pays far better under a shilling fee admitting to the whole thou it did when to see al its displays required an'outlay of some three or four times the present amount If Madame Tussaud were to profit by this example, the success of her exhibition would, we doubt not, be even greater in proportion.

			BURFORD'S PANORAMA.
			To Burford It makes very lttle difference, as far as putting forth great attractions go, whether it is a holiday time or not. Ile is always sure of a eelect and mnoderately numerous attendance at any time, and, in fact, the very nature of his exhibition places it out of the range of the London holyday sights which the mere Easter folks always rush teasee. Yesterday the views shown hero were-tho new Panorama of Venice, Canton, and the Righi Kulm. The iattsr splendid picture has only been added within the last few days, and It certainly deserves to rank with the mnost celebrated of all the panoramas which have here been given to the public. In this painting St. Mlark's, of course, is a prominent feature ; but all thc details of this queen of cities are given with themost elaborate finish and with that extra- ordinary skill in perspective which distinguish Mr. Burford's drawing. The beautiful picture of Canton seems to be almost as popular as ever: while that of the Righi Kulm which is older; than 'any, appears to be the most popular of all the three. It certainly deserves to the very fullest all the admiratlon which it receives, for it is unques- tionably one of the best and most effective views of that charming mountain scenery which we have ever beheld. If the exhibition at Leicester-square contained this view alone it would of Itself most amply repay a visit.

			GREAT GLOBE.
			No great Easter novelty was put forvard at this popular place of amusement yesterday, its managers relying upon its fine set of dioramas to draw as many of the holiday folks as heretofore. This confidence was not at all misplaced as it turned out, for during the whole day the building was crowded, and its stock attractions seemed as pleasing as ever. The Tour of the Rhine, though one of the oldest of the set, is also one of the most admired, and seems as if it would take its place with Mont Blanc and the other stan- dard exhibitions of the metropolis. Most of the views by which the tourist is taken in picturesque stages through the quaint old city of Rotterdam, past the Drachenfels, and so on by Mayence, Worms, Strasburgh, and Bodensee, up to the very sources of the Rhine in the Swiss Alps, elicited some well-deserved marks of appro- bation. The dioramas of China, of India, and of Italy, thoegh all, even to the latter now rather passs in startling interest, seem, notwithstanding, to meet with as much favour as when they were first presented to the public. They are in flast, really good as scent productions and weU selected Lor the visitor as to points of Interest. In the course of the day good lectu res were given on Savoy and MIorocco, so that numerous as were the visitors, there was something to please all tastes, and throughout the audlescesawere enter- tained in a mrnner whichquit=e j'ustified the popular con- fidence In the merits and resourcesof this establishment.

			ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS. IEGENTS-PARK.
			There are verY few showa In London better worth a visit tbsn these gaIdens. Tho examination of the magnificent collection of animas alone affords hours of interesting amusement, and the gardens themselves are certamiy among
			he prettiest and beat kept in the metropols. With a kind appreciation of the wants of the holyday folks in the way of cheap amusement, the whole place is open to the public during the first four days of Easter week at as low an adnms- elan fee as 6id., a rate of charge whEich we need scarcely say secured yesterday, in spite of the threatening weather, a numerous attendance of visitors. Daring the winter con- siderable additions and alterations have been made in the menagerie. There are a pair of fine cub liens, a lon and lioness, bred in the gardens, with litters of young leopards, pumas, wolves, and cheetas, also born in this country. A pair of whale headed storks, from the Blue Nile, bave been added to the birds, and the gigantic salamander of Japan Occupies the cage where last year the bullfrog preyed on his smaUer brethren. In venomous reptiles the collection seems to have suffered slightly during the past severe winter, the deadly Morocco snake having disappeared, with both the puff adders and all but one of the vicious Egyptian cobras. The great python, now grown to be the largest and thickest ever seen in captivity, is, however, with his numerous com- peers, in a robust state and growing larger every week. As a set-off for somo of these losses, however, a large zebra house has been' built, and in Australian squirrels and small deer some interesting specimens have been added. The vietor in vain, however, searches the coUection for one single representative of the magnificent breed of English dogs,-the bloodhounds, wolfhounds, mastiffs, and bulldogs for which England was once and is even still so celebrated throughout the world, but of which not a specimen is to be seen in w hat may almost be termed the national coUection at these gardens. A.n omission so important and so easily remedied only requires notice to prevent its being further overlooked by the council, who have already done so much for the gardens and who have made them during the last few years one of the most popularcad at the same time fashionable places of resort in Loudon.

			Lord J. RusseU had been invited, but was unable to be nresent.
			The loving cup having circulated, the usual loyal toasts were given from the chair, and cordially responded to by the counpany.
			The LORD MAYOR then proposed " The Army and Navy," pointing out the manner in which the wealth end commerce of that city must always depend on those services for their security.
			His Royal Highness the Duke of C=UMBRIDGE, who on rising was received with loud cheers, said,-MyLord Mayor, ladies, and gentlemen, I beg to acknowledge the compliment which you have been pleased to pay the Britieh Army. I always regard it as a high privilege to be permitted to respond to this toast, and, although I have the honour to be at the head of that arny, I trust it will not be deemed unbecoming in me to say that, notwithstanding we are not reputed to be a military nation, I flatter myself there is no army in Europe which, when caUled into action, can beat us in any respect. (Cheers.) It is the fashion rather to decry this country as a military rower; but the nation has always done the army the justice to admit that, when summoned to show what It can do in tho field, it has always come up to its expectations. (Cheers.) That is the state of the service at the present day, and I hope it will long continue so. The notice taken of the army on occasions liie the present tends in a great measure to keep up that high spirit without which it cannot be efficient. Beileve me, that the troops stationed in distant lands look with anxiety to see the estimation in which they are held in England. The first feeling that pervades all ranks is, "What will they think of us at home?" and the public acknowledgment which their efforts receive from their countrymen produces a most beneficial effect on all branches of the service. (Hear, hear.) Although most of those whom I have the honour of addressing are not immediately connected with the army, I am persuaded you aU agree with the remark of the Lord layor, that the riches of this great and influential empire are, in a great measure, owing to the army and navv. For if it wvere not for the security in which you all live and pursue your daily avocations-if it were not for the safety In which you individually and collectively feel that your ships and your trade can go to every part of the globe, this great empire and its commerce could not thrive as they now do, and as they have done for a lengthened period. (Cheers.) We all, of course, wish that that security may for ever con- tinue. Believe me, gentlemen, its continuance depends very much on yourselves. (Hear, hear.) If the liberality hitherto shown in supporting the army and navy is still displayed, you may rest in security both now, and, I trust, for many ages to come. But you must not shut your eyes to the fact that great efforts are necessary to attain this result. You cannot relax your exertions wlthout to a cer- tain extent deteriorating your national position. Nobody in this country, I am convinced, can wish to see any declen- sion in that position. This is, I believe, a great and glorious empire, at the head of the civilized world. We give the tone to civilized society in every part of the globe. That is a position which a great nation ought to strive to maintain. May you ever maintain it ! Viewing the army and navy in this light, I trust you will never allow their efficiency to be lmpaired. No doubt It Is a very expensive thing to keep up those services; but that is the effect of the very improvements which are taking place from day to day. The scientific advancement in all departments calls for a greater outlay then used to be requisite. That is a natural consequence of the march of intellect in modern times. WFhy, the very meanus of locomotion, the facility with which you can move vessels and troops, our railways and our steamships-all these advantages, which none caa appreciate more fully than the merchants and citizens of this metropolis, tend greatly to alter our position rtiatively to the rest of the worKld Therefore, although in former times, owing to our insular position, we were very secure in our daily life and occupations, we cannot disse from ourselves the fact that the Improved modss of commanlcation now existing have called for greaser vigour in all our defensive preparatione. (Bear, hear.) All that we desire-all that, I am confident, the country de- sires-is to be placed in a proper state of defence. Nothing can be imore objectionable, nothing can be more lamentable than a constant succession of panics. Believe me, these panics are the most costly things that can lap- p,en. (Hear, hear.) The extravagance which ensues
			them It is impossible to estimate. A wise and judicious annual expenditm-e is far less burden- some and much more effective for its object. I trust I shall be forgiven for making these observations, but they Involve matterswhich ought to be generally known. (Cheers.) I cannot sit down without expressing my sense of the ad- mirable spirit evinced by the country in the recent volun- teer movement. (Hear, hear.) I have said before that if that movement is well and judiolously organized I believe it will be found most valuable. But much-indeed every- thing-depends on the manner In which it is conducted. If it is conducted as a great auxiliary to the army and navy, nothing can be niore advantageous to the general interests of the. country. If, on the other hand, it is Intended to displace those services, the result will be most nnfortunate. As an adjtnct to the regular forces, hoe-ever, these volunteer corps are capable of rendering good service to the State. (Cheers.) His Royal Higlness concluded by again returning thanks for the
			army.
			Adimiral WVAI.co7r, M.P., responded on behalf of the nay, paying a high tribute of praise to the gallantry dis- played by both officers and men in the untoward affair of the Peiho.
			The Duke of CAtiersinc then proposed " The Health of the Lord Mfayor," at the same time acknowledging the princely hospitality shown by his Lordship tIat evening to bis guests.
			The LORD MAYOR returned thanks and then gave " The House of Lords," for which the bishop of Glocester responded.
			The next toast was "The House of Commons," which was acknowledged by Mr. W. S. Lindsay, IPl. " Prospe- rity to the Trade and Commerce of the City of London" was also drunk.
			Mr. GEORGE FREDERICK YovxaG returned thanks. The shipping interest, whoso proseerity was so intimately interwoven with the question of national defence, had been scandalously neglected. He hailed, ho wever, as the dawn- ing of better times the address to the Crown recently adopted by the HIouse of Commons in favour of a treaty of navigation between England and France.
			The remlaining toasts were of a purely compliment-ary nature.
			Co --,=e GARRIsoN S=PLECnASES.-These races, whichtakoplace to-day,underthe auspicesof the officers of the garrison and a large body of the neighbouring gentry, are expected to be nnusually attraetive. The ground which has been marked out upon the recently purchased Govern- ment property at Middlewick Farm, is in good order, and some of the leaps will, severely try the mettle of the horses entered for the various stakes. These comprise the Middle. wick Stakes, for which there are s,even entries the Grand Steeplechase Handicap, of 10 EOVS. each, with 80 added, egh!t entries * the Gorzrison Stakes, for horses the property of offcers, tbiree entries; the Essex and Suffolk Hunt Steeplechase, of 3 sovs, each,wt30ad,an :le cup valued at 30., 10 entries, th3ade,ndaslr

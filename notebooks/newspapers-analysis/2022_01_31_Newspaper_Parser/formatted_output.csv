I never esgalted in asy secular pursuits: never incurred ecelestastical censure .t slays enjoyed the confidence of mny diocean, the esteema of myP brethren in the ministry, and the lore of the people amnong w¢hom Ilah3bured. For 23 years I ministered in one parish as sole curate to a population of 1.200 church-going people. ii another I performed the duties of curate without any stipend whatever be- cnuse tne incu mbent was a poor mtn and my meanu s ere ample then. Mfy salary for 30 years never exceeded £e75 a year, In 1S61 I was pro- Iuoted to my present beneice. It isa uunon of three parishes of vast .exteunt in a mountainous distrlct, in many Places inaccessible save on foot; population dense anid pauperized; having four buirial-grounds. and so far apart that ono would require tho powers of ubiqnity to give thean punctual attendance. There is no eeclesiastIcal residence. The iet income, after deducting house rent and the keep of a horse, Is lFss than 1100 a year. This is all I have to live on now. I have a wife aud seven children. The rest you may imagine. I am nov an old man, worn down in the service of the Church, requiring rest yet not able to pay a curate: private means exhausted, Income inadequate, children trowRlng up (five of them femalesi, all to be educated: no pro- Yision made, not eyen by vidow's fund. If I were called home to- morrow, the poorhouse (primarily speaking) is the only asylum for them. These are the circumstances under which. my Lords and Geun- tleinen, I SOLICIT at your hands, eaniestly amid respectfully, a PRi- SENTATION for my SON to Christ's Hospital, either in the year 1866 or 1867. I have the hononr to be &c., , ARTHUR MO1HYPEY, A.B., O.L.K.

The Itome at East Barnet accommodates 35 boys; there is a form of 50 acres, in the cultivation of whicb, and in the care of the animals, the boys help. , Some of the boys rgdmitted into there Homes have been crossing- aweepers, begg,ars, or the sons of beggars; -ome the sons of domestic servants who bave fallen into distrews; rome the children of parents who rave died in the London hospitals, and thus left them destitute; some the children of vicious parents, who haye deserted them or who have been remoyed frons them by the arm of the law. , The Committee feel convinced that the maintenance of such indus- trisl Homes is the best and most promising mode of relieving the metropolis of juvenile destitution and crime. Boys who haye, from nio fault of their own, fallen into destitution and want, and are en thel high road to crime, have been prevented from becoming a burden to their country as beggars or thieves, and are being converted into Indus- trious, honest, working men. , l.'hese Homes have been certfied by the Secretary of State. and are visited by 1lcr Majestys Inspector of industris Schools and by te Council of the Reformatory and Refuge Union.

There wasanother circuinstance which had given him a still strongir convitilon that no suck messure as the present would have been .proposed. (Here the noble lord pronounced an eloquent euloglum upqn the lste Ar. Canning, and abservea&thatmarvy. of the present adminiitration bhd been followers-of that dii4 tinguished statesman, wiho had alwaysbeen a resolute anti-rea former). He could not have belieied, though God knew he' badJived long enough tosee very strange things cometopars, that such a measure could havo-pr6ceeded from sueXit mints. try. lHe had espectedagreat deal- from tbem, w'ell knowing that no paltry measure would do; but 4 messure of so great eitent had filed hia with' ,asmonlshmEmt. He-woulil not call !bhemeasure revolutionary due: forthat term seemed to be unpopular,and certainly wAs unjust., if by revolution was mneant spOlation, anirchy, and confusign; but then' it was, net to nince theworda ra4icl ehangeib the cons itutlen -for it tore up by' the roots one idterest that hud logb prevai?ed In tbe House ot'Commons, andleft it to-be returned-entirely by Popular decti *n. That, he thought, endangered the monarchy. But hiM prin. ipal point was, that the extent of' the tmeasure was totally u pnecessary. He admitted that it was necessary to go to accr tain extent, but he denied that they were caled upon tego 5 ) far as -this. What did the bill do ? It wholly disfrancfised 0E boroughsh it' deprived 47 of one-member ""chl. and 11 other boroughs were opened to housebolders of 101. a ye -#r. The powers vested In the Privy Council Were to be ex ercise4 for th- purpose of.-making all elections depend as mu ich as possible uipota.& considerable number of vo:ers. This, it was sad was a return to the old principles ofthe onsttt itiop; but Aslow htm to say tbht he did not thinki twas. Asearly asthereign-bf.Edward11I. the right of voting w as givenlto borougbs, and many of the boioighs were as old as Edward VI. and Elizabeth. He could not say, therefore, that this was a return to eld principles. But he should be told . *hat whbn,these boroughs first returned mem- , bers they were considerable place-, or comparatively VD, and' tbat thereotbre it was a returmx toldaprincples to take away the ranchise from ti iem and give them 'to larger towns. Now in the first place he ! very much doubted the fact of these bo. nugha ever hiavii g been much more, if at all more, consider. ible than they -iwe at present.

(Hear.) In other words, the noble duke was driven from office because he was- opposed tothe public mind on the question of to office because he was the advocate of reform. (Loud cries of "" Hear."") And here a word in- reply to the charge of precipitate rasbness-in bringing- forw2rd eur-hina- sure of reform. "" Do those who make thit charge recol. lect the state of the country when We succeeded to office? We found the country seriously disturbed-no confidence in- the -ivil -power-the spirit ef-bombinat6on ripe 'among the workmen in the maiufacturing towns, and the- jopulation of thd slUxchiefsoutherh counlies of Epgland ir. a state of almost open-insurrectimi;a r2adyf prey to iicendiaries- anfdplnderers of every description. (11ear.) -We found, more'ovir, the'divHl owDer' withont energy or direction; *themagistratesin the dig- turbed districts afraid toract, ani'tbe King's peaceable sgxbjects either besieged in their hkuses by-imght, or openly attack'ed sn plunfered In the day. (Hear,hear.) 'Ve foundiwhat was a stitl:mere dangetfou state of things in the unwillingness of the middle classes to support the t3overnment in- the suppres- s'on 'o theseldisturbances,'(1bud cries 'of "" heai""),-an un- willingness whielt had been,tarriedto suchiW-pitchannour ac- cession te officej'that I am confident that- even so experienced a military commander as the noble duke himiself would'find itf no easy snatter by the mere aid of an aimed soldiery to pacify the disturbed districts,trnaides, or at best but feebly and coldly. aided, by that important body in every free state,-the middle classes. (Hetar.) This wvas the state of the corintry,.not only in the disturbed rural districts dF the country, but in the large towns,'on ouraccession to office.- Vhat then did we do and with What success ? Why, we first won back the confiaence and support of the middle classes. (Hear.)' This important body we saw alienated from the civil power by the declaration of tbe noble duke against reform ;-that alicnation was. removed by the counter.pledge of his noble friend (Grey) in favour of reform. (Hear.) Having thus made this im- , portant efect- on the -public mind,-and having enlisted the confidence and support- of the property of -the country in our capacIty'and intentions to carry on the affairs of this great- empire, and having fl±mly, yet niercifihlly, asserted the majesty of the law public tranquillity was restored, and -tbe way was prepareg'for internal improvement (Hear, hear.) The noble duke's declaration, then, once fbr all, led to the fall of his administration, and not the vote on the dvil list or the opposition of the party new in power."" Indeed, he had reason to believe that that declaration had alarmed most ofthe noble duke's colleagues, and that they took advantage df the division on the civil list to tender the resignation of their office. (Hear). "" We then gave a pledge of reform on our ac- cession to office, and the question was as to, the manner and the perrod of our redeeming it."" (Hear.) He. need not'any that had ministers contented themselves with'barely redeem. ing their pledge by a moderate measure of reforn, just suffli- eient to save their credit in the eyes of a portion of the public, they would not satisfy the just expectation of- the public mind. But such a course would be no fulfilment of either the spirit or the letter of their pledge, and they knew that no policy, or rather impolicy, was more blindly mischievous than an obstinate resistance to the jusf claims of the people; and they knew that no lesson of history had been more fre- quently taught than that the ill-timedrefussal of the just claims of a nation had no other effect than to increase the demands ofthe petitioners higher and higher, till you were compelled to yield without thanks what wound be if timely yielded, re- ceived with gratitude. (Hear.) RMinisters knew and felt all this, and therefore'were determined that their measure of re- form should be one, from its broad basis, and from its adapta:' tion to the just demands of the people, of permanent settle- ment. (Hear.) His noble firiend denied that the measure would be a permanent one; but his assertion being only an as- sertion, should he met but with the counter-assertion that it would be so. By our plan an end would be put at sace and for ever to therotten borough systemn; and the elective franchise would be bestowed on a large and importaut class which at present were denied it:.in other words, we at one blow removed a great abuse and provided an efficient remedy (hear) ; we enabled all those Who posbsesed sufficientproperty to insure their independence-to exercise the right of franchise, and, without yieding to the extravagant claims, we satisfied the -just demands of the people.- He was warranted then in saying that the plan of ministers would be a permanent measure, far having property for its basis, it had been received with satisf?action by all classes of the public. Could any noble lord who heard him venture to denv that the mneasure hbd been hailed with satisfaction by the eilightened and respectable portion bf the piblie,-by the middle'elasses to a man,-by the towns and agrictltural districts? Let them look to the numerotxs daily county meetings which were held in its favour-to the countless ' petitions which were pouring in from all quarters iatid' classes, strongly approving of its principle and provisions: let them look to the emphatic declaration in its favour of the first com- , anercial body in the worl4,-he meant the merchants and bankers of the city of' London (hear): let them look to the unanimous acclaim in its favour of the public voice through its great organ the public press,-in fact, let them test the measure by every possible means of ascertaining public I ,plnion, and then say whether reform could be-longer resisted, md whether the plan of tbe Governinent bad rot met tbejust !xpectations of the public. (Loud cries of "" hear."") Then, gain, as to the support which the hill had received from hose to whbom his noble firiend had imputed ulterior views let hem coulsiderehe readinsess withwvhich all parties had consent- d to forego their own private speculatiye opinidons on'reform n favour of the present measure, and thea' say whether it was lot one wrhirls from its universal satisfaction was liktely to be a mermaneat one. (Hear.) But his noble friend denounced heir cutting off so many rotten boroughs as, in fact- - revo- ution in tbe constitution of Parliarnent. Now he robily could 3at see how any measure short of lopping off altogether the rotten boroughs could effect those beneficial results which thu public expected from their mea""use nf reform. These rotten boroughs were so monstrous an abuse, were so wholly inde. Fensible, that he need not trouble their lordships by pointinp outtheir hideous defects. (Hear.) Theyh3d so many proofs daily before their eyes of these abuses,-they had them in the printed records of the evidence given at that bar of the pro. ceedings of Penryn and of Grampound, adverted to by his noble fricnd, in which bribery and corraption were as notorious as the sun at noon day, that it was almost a waste of time to more than mention them. (Hear.) Had their lordships forgotten the evidence'to which he had just alluded ? Had they forgotten the notorious corruption ofthe rotten bo- rough system ? Did they not know that persons of every sect or religion nominated to seats in the other'hotise of Patr , liament ? Had they forgotten that the threat of a noble bo. rough-monger, that he would put his own nienial in Parlia- ment-as a representative, forsooth, of the people of England -was not fullilled from wast of power on the part of the pro- prietor, but from his individual. discretion? He had himself heard the fact of aomineeship-that libel on the representa. tion of a frec people-distinctly avowed not long since in the other house of Parliament; and in common with, he was sure, most who heard him, he had heard of sales of seats in the ether house 'being a maiter ot daily ocurrence -that, for example, 1,2001. a year was some. times paid to some borough-broking attorney for the re. presentation of some rotten borough, which he perhaps bad never heard of before, and which he perhaps would never visit. <Hear.) But the abuses of the rotten borough system were as-notorious, and their c'ontinuance would be in. rfamous. Even in the mtore open boroughs, need their lord- ships -be informedl of what they had in evidence, and must be individually aware of-the disgracefulbribery and corrup- tion of which they were alinost mvAriably the scene under the present perfect system ? (Hear.) If, then, these facEs were so nototious as to be indisputable, and if no measure ofrefbrm could or- would satisfy- tfie public mind th'at permaitted their continuance, how, he would ask, could ministers, injustice to themselves and the eountry, shrink fronm at onee boldly, but fairly and impartsaaUy,proposlng to disfranchise at once ealthose rotten boroughs which gave birth to so many abuses ? (Hear). But the manner in jlilb the line of disfranchisement was drawn had been objected to by his rtobla friend.' The object mninisters had in view, in drawing this line, had been- inuch nti}sundersrood in that house and elsewhere. In fixingr upon a pepulation of 2,000 inbabitant, as the line inside of which all boroughs should be disfranchised, their object was to cut off al those rotten boroughs, for which there could be no purifying remnedy by way of extension of franchise. It was not because the beroughs the population of which ras under 2,000 contained but few electors, that they proposed to lop them off, but because they could not possibly extend the franchise in them so as to do away with the evils of the close borougb nominee system. (Hear). This was the reason why he fixed upon the population returms of 1821, and not from any attachment too particular number or theory (Hear); and in fbunding upon them their line of disfranchisement,they were wholly influexcted by regard to the general goad of the community at large, without consideration of personal detri. ment or advantage. (Hlear.) And here he hoped he might be permitted to say a few words in reference to himself,impure motives havig beoanimputed to bim whicb it wast hut fair to allow him to refute, the rather as 'his situaui'6ffini tih Goversi. ment required sucs refutation to be explicit. (Hear, hear.) It had been stated that he had used his official influence in favour oa the county with which 'he had the honour of being connected, in procuring for it en addi- tional maember, to which it would not otherwise be entitled.

But how stood the fact'wtb respect to the county of Dturhamn ? Sinmply that it contained 50,000 inhabitants more than the numnber, is56,ooo which had been fixed as the line above which the counties were te receive an additional member (hear); andi that if they re- fused to Darhaun this additional member, they shouldu lso ox. tend their refusal to tenother counties, inc}uded in the bill,and , the two rigs et' Yorkshire, which it is intended shall send a , member each. (ear.) Durham was to have 3new member, because It fell within the line of wealth and' population which , had-been fixed upon as ajust ground for an extended represex. , tation, and not because he was accidentally connected- with it. (Hear.) Then, with respect to the three towns in that county which would return members under the ministerial plan of reform, all he need say was, that their population was far above the line of population and property wlich had been; after due consideration, fiLxeduponasthebasisofextending , a representation to the large towns,-that he had no connex. ion of property whatever with tivo of them,-and that-witb the third a noble marquis (Londondezry) who was opposed to the biul had as much eonuexion and -influence of property as be , had. (Hear.) In truth, he should be ashamed- to stand up , in that house if such - an unworthy motive as that he -was then disproving could for a mnometit -influence him. , He might, if he had been so inclined, have ebjoyed under the ,resent system a Parliamentary influene in- the county- of udrham-where he ebjoyed.-property. highly favourable to -uch influence-but he found the sp'ottoo expensive ; and though some of his family might always be sure oft a seat were It an object of hit amnbitlen,- he never sought thd posses- sion of6uch influence, having contented hinisif with haying, in his own peison - and at an immuense cost, asserted the great cause of inderendence-in the choice ef- representatives of his nativecounty.- (Hear.) The hoblelord havingrepeated tlat he was far above such -mere paltry personal considerations and that he held the- imputation In inefFbble contempt, ana that he entertained 'higher notions of- the inotives of all publlc men' than was' usually ascribed to them, pro- , cedet to say- that the line of disfanchisement of the , rotten boroughs included all boroughs which could not , - , - .t r .- .- . : , . , be purified by an extenslontof the ftirdan se. The bo roughs which were above-that line; it'was concesved msght- , punfied by a more extensive' and ieia dent conatltuency,J and accordingly the object was to secureth'enscha,constrtu'I ency.

'The - number;% according to those-returns, - was- only 378;786, of whom- but 116,000 were rated at from 101. to 15L, and that out of a popu. lation of 14,000,000. In Scotland tbere would be' but 36,700, of whom only 17,900 were of the lowest class,' and those rated at from 101. to 15l. - In fact, the charge which, might have been!-btought against ministers with' -nuch -greater plausibility was,h that'they had not madi the national' con- stitueCy numerous enough. It had- pleased -the-noble lord also to refer to Liverpool, where the number of, elec. tors; according to his statement, 'would be 26,000,' but hbw. could so many- be entitled to vote' when there were altogether only 10,000 houses? B'esides; the noble lord -appeared to forget that the non-resident freemen were to be entirely disfranchised. HIe would now briefly advert to the advantages which he- confidently expected would emanate from the measure of reform which ministers had brought.for- ward. Many in that housec and elsewhere, had represented that there was a spirit of disaffettion abroad,-tbat the lower classes were hostile to the institutions of ' thee6untry,- were 'desirous to overthrow 'theJlouse of Peers,' and aub. Tert the monarchy. This he denied- but granting it to be true, in what class would the friends of the constitu- tioa be' likely to- find, henceforward, a more steadfast ally than in the middle classes, out of whom the leaders of revolution would otherwise have been chosen?,When could they look forward to greater success in a conflict against .the enemies of settled institutions than' when so-supported ? But no such feeling existed, and he believed in his canscierice that no such conflict would occur. (Hear, hear.) The lower orders, -on the contrary, were ardently attached to the monarchical form of government, they desired neitheratheoretical republic on the onehband, noriLpere'despotism on the other butmerely. sought to recoverthosecivil- rights and consritutmonal- prini- leges, of thich time and the course of 'events- had gradually deprIved them. (Heeai, hear.) In the preparation -of this measure vested rights had been scrupulously regarded, and no disfranchisement was contemplated except only in the case of rotten boroughs. The Iboachise of even the lower had been saved,'- although' in many'ifistances so notoriously abused. The opponents of the bill had endeavonred, to excite sympa- thetic jealousies on' the part of the potwalloppers'and bur- gesscs but those bodies disclaimed -all community of feeling. wilth te anti.reformers, and petitioned generally in favour of the measure. Driven from 'this strong hold, the opposition had now changed their' groundi,and professed similar-zlarm for the privileges of the a.pprentices.- Bow that tbody mpight- act under such circumstances, it was not for him to- say; but' judging from the manner in which-others hadl performed their patt, he had no doubt that they likewise would emulate such an example, and that they would not interfere to deprive the country of a benefit 'in which they -vould participate them. selves. He regretted having wearied the house with so much of detail, bilt felt it - necessary to mention what he had stated, however irregularly, in asawer rto the noble lord who bad preceded him.. (Hear.) The. noble .lord, 'he' perceived, had made a aomewhat sarcastic.allusion to the power which it was 'proposed' that the Privy Coun. cil should exercise 'in. the furtherance of this plan of re. form; ministers had conceived that the duties which thev in- tended to impose on the Privy Council were of a nature wihich could only with propriety be referred to a body of the highest dignity and authority'immediately-connected with the Crown itself, and intrueted 'with the most important functions in the government of the State.- Out of that body might be se. lected persons totally apart from the administration, eminent for- char-cter and talent, whose decision could not possibly be impugned as that of interested parties, and who were there~ foreliable to no misconstraction of motives or imputation, akin to those which had been already directed against himself and others on the dicussion of this question. (Hear, hear.) He. should now coma to almost the laIt topic that it seemednecessary tonotice. The noble lord had said that he did not charge tbe framers of this mca. sure with being actually revolutionary, but had asserted that 'they were-introducinga complete change in theexisting insti- tutions ofthe realm,and so aniiadverted onits provisionsas to convey-the implication that their tendency was directly revo. lutionary although he ostensibly disclaimed employing the word. dis Majesty's Government had. however, been as. saied by others,, and that in no measured terms, with re- proaches that they were destroying the,constitution,and perni. ciously changing all the relations which had heretofore sub sisted between each branch of it. The revolution of 1688 had been also alluded to as not more complete than that -which was -now contemplated by those who now conducted the administration of the country, but he was not to be scared by a nickname, or discountenanced by a word. He had heard that memorable revelution termed a glorious event by the esame persons who now used the epithet fbr the pur- poses of denunciation and opprobrium. They had formerly upheld the revolution as glorious, and wortby of grateful re- collection, for the advantages which it had conferred- upon Englishmen (cheers- from the opposition), but it might be said that te proposition ofiministers was a departure from the principles of the revolution. To refute such an assertion was not then his intention, but he would only observe, that those noble lords who now professed such horror at the very name of revolution, had never mentioned it except in terms of reverence and approbation during the discussion of the Catholic relief bill. Allusion had, moreover, been made to the French revolution ;-not to that which had recently occurred, but to the first French revolution wbich had taken place 40 years ago, and certainly such parallels, if speciously suggested, were well calculated - to terrify the wcak.minded and timid yet why was it that that revolution had ever happened? The people had massacred their supe- tlots, itw true,-'tur for whsevsuse-P..oe iu..coneucuce of their Just claims having been granted, but because they were -lvonfuly anedand pertinaciously withheld. (Eear.) The pou3eeeurried inocriminal enormities, ntnheaexu. tation otsucceas,-but in a paroxysm ofdespair. Such a deplora- ble consummation it was their object to avert, and the measure which htd been proposed, so far from leading to anarchy or revolutionary excesses would conciliate the disaffected, if such there were, while it strengthened and consolidated the fabric of the constitution. Nobie lords who accused ministers of re- volutionizing the state, were probably not aware that it- was one offBolingbroke's charges against theuanthors of the revo- lation, that'they-had not taken measures effectually to secure the isldependence of Parliament at the moment When they settled the snece%sson 'to the throne. rThe noble baron here read an extract from LZord Bolingbreke's works descriptive of thc political evils which were likely tO produce revolution, , and reprehending the promoters of that which had occiirred ini 1688, on account ofnot having sufficiently protected the people -from the future consequences of adefective representation.] Buthowwas it that the advocates f the Catholic reliefbill came forward on the present occasion to. taunt the friends of reform with charges of innovation ? Was it for them to object so loudly'to theintroductioaof change, after baving so materially altered the constitution by the admission of Rorman Catholics to privileges which they had not before enjoyed since the revo- lution ao often referred to ? (Hear.) The-policy adopted in reference to that portion of their fellow-countrymen was wise and judicious undeniably, but stiU was it not a change in the consttution ? It had been urged then, with a good deal of clamour and not- a little of pertinacity, that emsancipation -would alter. the two estates of the realm, would violate the coronation oath, would annihilate the chureb, and -lestroy the -liberties of the people. Such cbarges, in- , deed, were wholly unfounded, as the event had already preved, and he was uan of those who thought that that wise and important measure would prove -hereafter of the -most essential advantage to the state. Those wholsad been -formerly excluded from the legislature, and. exercised their energies out of doors with the most mischievous results to the community, were now adnmitted witbin the walls of Parlia- ment, and-eventuallyproved as. faithful subjects of their King as any whohad enjoyed seats there before. (Hear, hetr.) Hle had now, he believed, gone through-all the arguments of his noblefriend,-and didnotmeauto oppose his motion,butrather would supportiti and cordially; for-Ministers, be couldassure the noble lord, were most desirous that every attainable Infor. mation sheuld be granted.

Great and important aS these conse- quences of the bill wecre, they were. not the main, the most valuable features of it: but the great and broad principle of the bll,-that in which the beauty of it chiefly consisted was, the letting in of large quantities ot'EIis 3lajesey's subjectsv who had been hitherto altogether unrepresented.- Large towns, densely peopled,-marss of commerce,-emporia'of manurac- tures,-honest, and amiable, and industrious men, wihe in time oF peace contributed, to odvance the prosperty of tLeir country by the swevar of their brow, and who, in war, de- , fended their country by the sinews of' their arms, and by the'4 blood in their veins; hut who,'because'they had not been con- gregated into rnasses in certain small districts of the kingdom, had-not hitherto beese thought worthy of being represented in the 'legislative councilof the nation.

Thus, too, wopyholders were let in,-thus leaseholders were let in, and though it bad been said, that las leaseholders only of-21 years wets to be admitted, that alteration would notrmake-much diffhrence5 yet he must he allowed to dissent altogether from that position. He thought it would makte a vast difference. At the same time let.him aobserve,-but in saying this he begged it to be understood that he spoke merely as ans indivi- dual,-he should Inet care ii'the leas^eholder of the smallest term were let in; for, while he let in the tOWnS, it wras his anxious desire that the election for connties should be inde- pendent. Hus noblefriendhadalluded tohisecanvasiu thecouoty of York, but heheeFged to remind his noble friend that he had never tbought of canvassing the 'squires, though he had taken great care to canvass the towvns. Indeed, the squires were at. iirst violently opposed to him,.-as indeed moat of his heat friends always had been.-and among the squires of Yorkshire he had the honoux ofhoasting many frientds. The sq,uires actually held a nceeting.for the purpose of preventing his atanding,.-but he wras bound to add, that when they found they'couldnotdo that., 'the meeting endedinan invi- tation to him to offer himcelf as a candidate. However, he had net placed any dependence upon the squiries; all his reliance was upon the towns, for they were sure to carry the election. This his noble friend; knewr as well or better than he did; and he put it to their lordahips and to his a30ble friend whether that was a staxteof county represent-ation which oug5ht to be satisfactory to the country?i Now this bill re- stored the statcr of representation to what it ought to hed although his noble friend insisted that it was not sO good A meaSnre xs one' whish he could bave proposed, but which his noble friend had not proposed. last ot; all, then, such was -the state which this 'country had' reached, and the world at large had arrived' at suchl a state, that it was no longer just, no longer expedient, no , nor no longer even safie, that tbe-great moass of the honest and-rindus trieus people of this great kingdom ehould continue longer unrepresented.

He:woild' refir to.the opinion, of the--noble rmarquis 'oppn. site- whoiihe always hea,d with grcatdelight;' anbd wboliad isai that if he-had to form- a House of Commons, he would form orie li,e the present, giving a large preponderance-to -property, and the most- to lasdedproperty. Thc nobleV'lord opposite, too, had in aspeech whichbheinadbinl8l7,isid'that the Heuseeof CoK;monKv sas alvways read fo attend- to-the interests of the people. This speech of; the noble earl wai made upon-bis presenting a petit-on tothat house rpon thii very' subject'oE reform. 'He must:satyhen, that tbe opinioh -which he gave at' the comnmencement of thdissessiod *as not' at variance with those opinions!of the noble:earl and the noble marquis. He would. add, too,.tbat he' retained that opinion now, and that he should entcrtan itmorestrongly till tbhe last hourofbbslife-r.especislly.aait vas an opinionwhichwagbrmne out by every eminent man who had spoken upoIl the subject.' Well, then,-but it was said that.itbecanie necessary forzthe Governmint to propose somet plaR of refirmin'the represents.' tive ay.tem. Now, he must say-bere, that-sorme observations' which have -fa1en fron) the -noble lord, the, Privy -Sal,' and from the noble, and learned lord,. the Chancellor of Itelind, were not quite correct as to facts; and upon those observaY tions he felt-himeelf caled' upon' fo-make some-remarke.' It. was quite true that when the' late Govenmment brought forward. the Catholic question, thoy were supported by many noble lords who were generally in opposition to the (overn. ment. He)had tbe misfortune on that.occasiont o lose the ,sup. port aityiegardofa greAt numaber of friends both-thereandin the other house of Parliament. That wasa misfortun' which- he shouldnever- ceasetelament; yet he had the consolation of-knowing -that-in what-he then did,. he did no more thkei whathis.putlic duty reqtiredof him. '(Cheers) Believibg;, as'he did t-h-t civil war musut be the conseqeaceoef continu- , ingtoreiusethe se±lement of that iuestion, he- thought That he should have beeu wanting in his duty,p;both as a-man and as a ministcr, if he bad' hesitated' t'o'-give tip his forrner views with regard tO, tat .measure.' - 'The noble dtike proceeded to observe that the late'revolatiou-in France had occurred at-a-critical- period: it 'came, and like fo6tmerrveoletlons, such as those in Spain and Naples,it cer. taisly did create a very great senSation in -this country, abd a strongdesire was excited by speeches in varioas parts,and by the spirit aeveloped at the . elections for -Parlismentary reform,' a desire more--strong on the part,of the-people than.hadhbeen ,di*p]ijed fo'r ma,ny years with ;espRct to any political object.

(Hesr.) i The fashiea resulting,from the exairnple of. the French tand Belgan--revolutions had ntow iu bidd4-dpeople saw'the consequences of revolution to- be dii tregs and ruin.; and his belief was, if Parliament in its Wisdon decided that4ref6rmn was riot to beaarried,.that-the- country w&l4d 'submit to. the decision., - With respect to the question of the civil ast, lie had heard It stated .that there was no combination ofparties aainst the Government of theday: he would notsav 'anthing.which he did not know-to be fact; but he always. understood that there had been something of a . combihizion. lt vwas extraor4inary that all the gen. tlemen' wlo usisuall ittacie'd -themselves to. -certain partiEs isoulg accidentally combine to vote against, Go- vernment. ' However this might be, - he- was 'defeat. , ed on the question of the civil list: in short, the Govern. , ment was-placed in a minoritv. . Upon that, finding that he- had the misfortune no longer- tolenjoy the confidenco of the Housc- of' Commons, he 'tE-ought proper to resign the situat-l6h wlhiich'he beld His Miajesty's service. ..At that period the qusestion of parliainentaiy reform had no. nore to do, as far as he was concermd, with the resignation .which be, had tendered to His Majesty on the day. foUowing the defeat on the civil list, than any thing else ilthe world. He admiitted he resigned njext moriing becpu4se- be did- not wish. to expose His 'Alajesty anid the country to the cansequences that muight result -from the Government going ,out on the aucces,9rfethe gqestion -of Parliamentary reform.. There was the' trotb, but to. sardadfiernieuThponcerenr of Parliamentaty reform was wrong. He had resigned upon the ground before stated, and he 'had resigned at the particn. lar moment wheni he did, because he did not choose to expose his Majesty and the country to -the consequences, that migst ensue from the occurrence of the. case just men- tioned. There was the real fact of -the storyd, But the noble and - leamed lord taid. the late ministry 'had given up the princtple of Parliamentary reform by their resignation: no such thing-they resigned because they did net possess the confidence of the Hoase of Commons, and they thought that the same majority which defeated them on Mo0nday on the civillist, might have defeated them on Tuesday on reform, and then they would have sacrifised (as the noble lord said) -the prici,ple of Parliamentary reform in the Commons. He did not-think it worthwhifleto makeany further struggle in order to retain officea day ortwolonger. Hle came now- to the circumstance of the members of the present government saking ofice, end he found the noble earl stating on the first, opportunity aEt-er havinig occupied office, the three principles of his Government,; and these were,- retrenchment5' peace, and refomn. As for retrenchment and peace, he maintained that there existed no difference between the noble earl and himself. As far as be had heard, up to that moment the noble earl had not found a single sLx- pence to be retrenehed in the pablic expenditure; every thing , ad been done-which could be done by the late Govermment to. promote economy iq all our establishments... With respect-to peace, h'e hoped' the noble earl b'ad found things in sach a train that he could and would be'able to maintain peace with all' the world. He did not say thAt sonedetailshadn6toc. curred since his resignation, in wbhih he could not agree with the noble earl, but sooner than pat the noble earl to the risk of any 'inconvenience -with respect to subjects so delicate, lie would nbt havc a single question asked in relation to them if he could help it, because no- mars desired more than hiinself the prosperity -oi the noble eati's government, not out of any peculiar attachment'to the noble earl hini5eif, but through love of bis caunnery. Parliamentary reform wvas tlhe re. maining questiou,-for the introduction of that it appJear- ed ministers had obtained the consent of Hlis Mlajesty, and certainly it appeared that His Majesty's name had been used upon the suibject, and, he believed, frequently-by per- sons who were by no means authorised to use it, and also upon occasions whent it ought not to have been used. It wns true Government had the sanction of His Mlajesty to bring forwvard th e question of reform-perhaps this measure of reform;* but-to say HWis M'ajesty had taken a miore active part in the n;atter than was implied in taking the advice of his ministers, was not constitutional [hear]; and such being the case, he could not consider the assertion as bring founded in fact. L,et us see what such a measure ought to he, and let us see what it was. A measure of Parliamentary reform brought forward by Government ought to be a measure which should enable Government to carry on she K:ing's service in Parliament ac- cording to the constitution as it wvas established at the revolu^. tion, and as it had since proceeded. How bad the public sear. vice been carried on since the revolution ? By. pertons of ta- lent, property, and knowledge-scientific, polttical,' commer- cial, ' and m;mufacturing,-men' connected with or represent. i althe- great- interests- of the country,-men noted for talents, who on-dall occasions had heen .a conservative party in the at .te; -and wb'o had supported the powecr and glory of the country in wvar, and had promoted htr prosperity in peace during the last 140'years. If we weret tolo;e such a Parliamnent, Mtinisters were bound to sce that their aew sys- tem of election shlould be such as wtould secure the KSing's Goveemneat the support of this ether Parliarment when formed upon thenewvprinciple. Look at thenew system . His noble friend, who had addressed the house early in the debate, stateted with great deamness what would be the result of the bill in certain respects. His noble friend stated that throughout the towgns of.Englantt and Wales many existing interests would be intetibrel wvith, end he altostated the eff'ect of giving wotea to 10O. householders for counties. 'His noble frlcead'ii satamennens well deserved the attention of their lordahins. Hle , hinnself had examissed the bill with reference to iesi effects On the county of Southampton, In that county were se- , veral towns-Winchester, Christchureb, Portsmouith, South- ampton, and the borough of Lymington. Sereral borou6gbs in this county were struck out of the represeitation by the bill, ""u""d there were besides a vast 'number of coniiderable , towns left unrepresented, but the voters of these places were to come into the county constituency. Axcording to the old system the voters of the towns had 'votes for the county. Now copyholders and 501. lemeholders were to- vote for the county. - In the towns those two classes were for the most part shopkeepers. He was 'convifced that there werenot less than4;0001or 5,000 such inhabitants of towns in Hampshire, who would come to have votes for the county as well as thefreeholders. Now of whom did this class of electors consist-? 'As he haa before stated, they were 8hopkeepers-respectable shopkeepers-in the towns. Hle beggAd to ask, were they fit persons to be the only clectois to to return county members to a Parliament which wva to gover the afftirs of this great natton, consisting of 100,000.0 , of sujbects,'and so many Various relationi, foreign, domestic, colonial, commercial, and manufacturing? Men of the de- NcriptiOn he had mentioned,-mith their prejudices and pe. -culiat- interests, however respectable as a body,, could nit he fit to be the only electors of membets of the House , sfCpinmobs ? But -he begged to sa, that however respect- able1 this, or any other class of electors mlghtbe, there vwa a-strong';reasoi againSt aniy uniformity of system in the representation of thcountry.

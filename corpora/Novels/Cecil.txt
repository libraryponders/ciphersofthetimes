it inconvenient to contemplate her beauties in her own.
• Take him to the glass, poor little fellow! He loves to
look at his ribbons fluttering in the light.”
I suspect that, even then, what I loved to look at, was
the same personal reflection that delighted the eyes of her
ladyship. But no matter.
When my little self, or rather my great nurse, grew
tired of the dancing system, there were other glittering
objects in my mother's sanctum which I found almost
equally attractive, - jewels, feathers, flowers, and frippery
of all descriptions. I usually visited her at dressing-time.
The baby was less in her ladyship’s way while adoring,
With head uncover'd, the cosmetic pow'rs,
than when adored, in her turn, by the men of wit and
pleasure about town; Colonels in the Guards, and Member-
lings of parliament, who had the honour of being inscribed
in the list of the young and fashionable Lady Ormington.
As soon as I grew old enough to roll about the Ax-
minster carpet, the rich garlands interwoven in whose
soft tissue delighted my eyes by their gay colours, the
nurse was desired to leave me; and while the lady-
mother and the lady’s-maid were engrossed in their
mysteries, paying no more attention to me than I to my
neglected rattle, I watched unnoticed the play of the waving
satin train they were adjusting, the glitter of the diamond
tiara, and the turn of the snowy feather. Gewgaws were
my earliest playthings; and my primer consisted of the
flourishing capitals at the head of a milliner's bill.
I have described my face as puny; but I know not
why I pay it so poor a compliment, since there is no one
to gainsay me and do it right; for it was unquestionably
to my personal charms I was indebted for my entrée into
Lady Ormington's sanctum sanctorum. I was the first of
her children admitted to be danced before her glass, or roll
upon her soft carpet. Yet I had a brother and a sister;
a brother destined to inherit the honours of the family,
and a sister born to share its affections. But the Honour-
able John squinted, and the Honourable Julia had red
hair ; and our lady-mother was as heartily ashamed of them

both, as if they had been palmed upon her from the
workhouse.
From the day of my birth, on the contrary, nurses and
toadies were unanimous in protesting that I was the living
image of my sweet mamma; and as my sweet mamma
was the daughter of a country Squire, whose face had been
her fortune, and whose fortune it was to win the heart and
hand, or rather the hand and coronet, of the Right Honour-
able Lord Ormington, she might be reasonably excused for
some maternal partiality for her miniature, adorned with
a satin cockade and twelve yards of superfine French
cambric.
My mother's instinctive vocation was for the toilet.
Her beauty had been her stepping-stone to distinction; and
she seemed to think too much care could not be bestowed
on its adornment, as devotees erect a shrine to a favourite
divinity. It was true, the worship was gratuitous. There
was nothing further to gain ; no more hands, at least, and
no more coronets. As for hearts, it is to be hoped that
Lady Ormington neither brandished the powder-puff, nor
spread the rustling hoop, with any mal-intentions towards
those fragile superfluities of the human frame divine.
But if fashionable notoriety constituted the object of her
desires, the ambition was gratified. There was an Orming-
ton pouf, and an Ormington vis-à-vis ; an Ormington
green and an Ormington minuet. In those unlettered
times, Annuals were not: but a languishing portrait,
limned by Cosway, was charmingly engraved by Barto-
lozzi ; and the Right Hon. Lady Ormington, leaning on a
demi-column, with “ Sacred to friendship” engraven on
the plinth, a stormy sunset in the background, and a
bantam-legged silken spaniel staring its eyes out in the
foreground, figured in all the printsellers' windows ; im-
mortalized by certain stanzas, silken as the spaniel and flat
as the landscape, from what Dr. Johnson and courtesy used
to call “ the charming pen of Mrs. Greville."
I recollect contriving to convert the favourite scarf of
her ladyship into a bridle for my rocking-horse, on the day
when the said engraving, richly framed, was first placed in
her boudoir; and so delighted was she with the print,

(which, I concluded, was intended as a cadeau, for I never
saw it again,) that she magnanimously overlooked my
misdemeanour.
There was something else, by the way, which we all
seemed inclined to overlook; i.e. the Right Honourable
Lord Ormington. I hardly recollect hearing his name
mentioned, either in the dressing-room, drawing-room, or
nursery. The scholarship derived from the important
great letters heading the Christmas bill of Madame Lebrun,
had not assisted me a sufficient number of steps up the
ladder of learning to enable me to decipher the newspapers,
even if my “sweet mamma” had not been too fine a lady
to admit them into her boudoir; or I might have found it
written down there in malice, that his Lordship was one of
the heaviest prosers, supporting, in the Upper House, the
Country-Gentleman-Interest of Great Britain. As it was,
I knew nothing about him, except that there was a cross,
gaunt, pig-tailed old fellow, much scouted by the livery of
the house, who went by the name of “my Lord's own
man ;” and that every evening, as the under-nurse was
hushing us off to sleep, the rumble of wheels from the
door of our house in Hanover Square used to be hailed
with a remark of -" There he goes to the 'ouse ; — much
good may it do 'em !"-
Upon whom his Lordship's departure for the House was
likely to confer a benefit, I was not of an age to trouble
my head. Let us hope that the nurses pluralized the
nation ; referring the collective interests of the three king-
doms to the collective wisdom of Parliament.
Time progressed. I had fallen in the world four feet
and a cockade - from my nurse's arms to a go-cart. To
contemplate myself in the glass, I was now forced to climb
into a chair. But I was rewarded for my pains. The
puny face had expanded into a fine open countenance sur-
rounded by hyacinthine curls. Impossible to see a more
charming little fellow ! Lady Ormington seemed to fancy
that every body was as pleased to look at me, as I was to look
at myself ; for 1 now superseded the spaniel in the
Ormington vis-à-vis, and was as constantly seen lounging
out of one window as Sir Lionel Dash wood lounging in at

the other. Many people fancied they could discern a
resemblance between us. For my part, I think Sir Lionel
bore a much stronger affinity to the spaniel, my predecessor,
both in point of fawning and foolishness. Yet I don't
know why I abuse him, for, while he never alluded to
John and Julia otherwise than as “those unfortunate crea-
tures,” he invariably qualified myself as “ Cecil, my boy!”
or,-“ There's a darling!”—
I can scarcely say whether it were Lord Ormington's
predilections, or my mother's, that kept us resident in town
eight months of the year. The only point on which they
seemed to feel in common, was a detestation of Ormington
Hall: perhaps because, at the family place, there was no
pretext of parliament or parties to keep them asunder.
My sweet mamma, however, usually spent her summers at
Spa, occasionally visiting Paris ; and the breaking out of
the war was a serious evil to a family which it reduced
to the necessity of domestic peace. I remember feeling as
strongly inclined to join the outcry against Pitt and
Cobourg as the Convention; for, while John and Julia
were left safe at the Hall, I had always been promoted to
the honours of La Sauvenière ; and the rooks, the avenue,
and Dr. Droneby, were antipathetic to my nature. I was
really in despair at the closing of the Continent! Bonbons,
maréchale powder, chocolat de santé, pommade à la vanille
- how were we to exist without these necessaries of life?
- What was to become of England, and her stupid martello-
towers,—the Pitt-posts, as they were called, for which the
country was to supply railing !-
A worse evil than war, however, impended over me.
John had long disappeared from the nursery. On return-
ing from our last expedition to Flanders, we found that,
during our absence, the young gentleman had been made
over to roast mutton, Latin grammar, and Dr. Droneby;
while Miss Julia was transferred to a school-room as cold
as a church, and a governess as stately as the steeple. ?
The head-nurse, who had presided over my cockade,
seemed to think it a good riddance. A similar opinion was
expressed by Lord Ormington and his own man, when, six
months afterwards, that lady herself was postchaised off
B 3

from the hall in one direction, while I was postchaised off in
another to a preparatory purgatory at Chiswick; where they
began with me as in a lunatic asylum, by cutting off my curls,
choosing my head to be as unfurnished without, as within.
I remember weeping bitterly for the loss of my nurse and
my locks. I was ashamed to look myself in the face after
being shorn thus vilely. But the only looking-glass within
reach was a thing as large as a half-crown, in the lid of an
enamel bonbonnière, given me at parting by my mother.
Moreover, I dared not cry too loud over my disfigurement;
for the horrible Dalilah by whom my clustering curls had
been curtailed, talked of corduroys, highlows, and a leathern
cap, in case I was refractory. The dread of seeing myself
transformed into an errand-boy suppressed my tears.
Let me pass lightly over my school-days, though,
Heaven knows they passed heavily enough over me !
Biographers, whether of themselves or others, seem to
luxuriate in pictures of academic innocence. For my part,
I have a horror of birch and bread-and-milk, even in
reminiscence. There is something excruciating to a well-
born young gentleman in being reduced to the toilet of a
Newfoundland dog ; viz. a rousing shake, a plunge into
cold water, and the eternal rusty coat of the day before.
Even at Eton, I was a miserable dog. In the first
place, because I was called Danby Secundus (The Honour-
able John having the advantage of me); and in the second,
because the duncehood, which had been passed over as a
minor evil at the preparatory, seemed likely to be flogged
out of me among the antique towers where “grateful
Science still adorns her Henry's holy shade,” and where
humbugging tutors still adore the flagellation of innocent
defaulters in classic lore. John was a regular sap —
Droneby and roast mutton had made a scholar of him.
Ugly little brute! what was he good for but Homer and
corduroys ?
At college, he obtained still further advantages over me.
He was beginning, indeed, to have the best of it every-
where. From the date of the abrogation of my curls, I
was out of favour, even in the boudoir. Sir Lionel Dash-
wood had been unable to repress an ejaculation of “little

horror !" on seeing me again ; and by the time John was
entered at college, a something of a paralytic attack seemed
to remind my sweet mamma that the Right Honourable
Lord Ormington was to survive in her elder son, when her
noble spouse took up his rest in the family vault, instead
of on the benches of St. Stephen's.
Neither he, nor I, nor Dashwood, nor even Dash, were
now admitted into the dressing-room. Matters were
growing too serious there. With sons of eighteen, ladies
who have stood godmother to a minuet or a taffeta, are not
fond of exposing to investigation the mystery of their
washes and pommades. The flaçons which formerly con-
tained bouquet de Florence or verveine, now held the lights
and shades of her ladyship’s complexion. Blue veins were
sealed in one packet, and a rising blush was corked up in
a crystal phial. Eyebrows — eyelashes — lips - cheeks-
chin — an ivory forehead, and a pearly row of teeth, - all
were indebted for their irresistibilities to a certain Pan-
dora's box of a dressing-case, furnished by Thévenot,
which sent forth Lady Ormington, full-armed for con-
quest, like the goddess that emerged from the brain of the
father of the gods.
But her ladyship was no longer the same woman as in
the days of the spaniel and the cockade. It was not alone
because Dashwood was in the Bench and I out of favour,
that I discovered a change. But she was growing almost
domestic, almost reasonable. She had given up balls,
— would not hear of an opera-box, - and for a year and a
half scarcely stirred out of her own boudoir. In place of
Sir Lionel there was a pet apothecary, who came every day
with his little budget, of scandal, just as Madame Lebrun
had formerly made her appearance with her little box of
laces ; and though certain persons, to wit, two old-maidenly
sisters of Lord Ormington, two card-playing, blue, Honour-
able Misses Danby, with brown-holland complexions and
tongues of a still deeper dye, protested that the only dis-
order afflicting their noble sister-in-law was an ugly
daughter, of an age to be presented at court, her ladyship
resigned herself to the sacrifices exacted by an elegant
valetudinarianism.

In winter, she seldom rose till candle-light; in summer,
the nuslin curtains of her chamber were never un-
drawn. A perpetual demi-jour surrounded her. Though
blessing her stars for not being hereditarily exposed to the
eruel revelations of the peerage, so as to be hopelessly
branded with the shame of having attained her eight-and-
thirtieth year, she could not blind herself to the fact, as
betrayed in the very looking-glass which had exercised so
singular an influence over my nature. Eight-and-thirty
was written there, in words as terrible as those of Bel-
shazzar's warning, —even in characters of crow's-feet!-
Eight-and-thirty is a frightful epoch in the life of a
woman of fashion. Hot rooms and cosmetics place it on
a level with fifty, in the lady of a country Squire. The
struggle between departing youth and coming age is never
more awful! A little older, and the case becomes too
clear for dispute. At forty, she gives up the field, allowing
that time has the best of it. But for the five preceding
years, those years during which, though no longer pretty,
a woman may be still handsome, the tug of war is terrific.
A woman never prizes her beauty half so much as when it
. is forsaking her ; never comprehends the value of raven
locks till revealed by the contrast of the first grey hair ;
never finds out that her waist was slim and her form
graceful, till she has been accused of enbonpoint.
Brother coxcombs! if you would have a proper value
set upon your homage, pay your court to a woman of
eight-and-thirty. The flutter of a little miss of sixteen is
nothing to the agitation with which the poor grateful soul
uplifts her head above the waters of oblivion, in which she
was succumbing. At that crisis, a dreadful revolution
occurs in the female heart. The finer sensibilities have
lost their edge; self-veneration is impaired by the slights
of society; the injustice of the world in scandalizing
virtue and exalting vice, has produced, par contrecoup, a
peevish misappreciation of the value of reputation. After
all, was it worth while to break so many hearts! Others,
less cruel, are more respected. She puzzles herself in
wondering whether they are more happy. It is a dan-
gerous thing to wonder on such subjects. It is like a
hypochondriac, feeling the edge of a razor.

At forty, she wonders no longer. She has resumed her
trust in excellence, her reverence for the spotlessness of
virtue; thanks Heaven for her escape; and renouncing
for ever the influence of the puppies, betakes herself for
consolation to the tabbies. Cards, – universal panacea !
cards that knit up the ravelled sleeve of care, boon Nature's
kind restorer, balmy cards,– inspire her with a new insight
into the purposes of existence. Lovelace himself might
do his worst! The votary of the odd trick

cacy of health, my father at length decided that Julia
should be introduced into society by his sisters. So much
the better for her !—The poor girl, who was really plain,
looked twenty times as well in contrast with their frightful
faces, as when approximated with her sweet mamma's still
lovely features. Julia was not altogether amiss, when seen
between Miss Mary and Miss Agatha Danby.
Lord Ormington generously provided them with a family
coach and an opera-box; and the daughter, of whom his
right honourable lady had seen so little during her school-
day martyrdom, took up her quarters with her maiden
aunts in Queen Anne Street, almost without her absence
being perceived ; leaving the woman of eight-and-thirty to
hope that the beau-monde would not trouble itself to trace
the connection between the beautiful Lady Ormington,
and a Miss Danby in the enjoyment of red hair and
eighteen years of age.
Of Julia, beyond this, I knew nothing. Having seen
her banished by my mother, and sharing to the utmost her
ladyship's abhorrence of the Judas complexion, I looked
upon her as a species of Paria. Of all physical defects,
red hair is one of the least remediable. The blackest of
wigs only renders the disfigurement more glaring. Apply
what pigment you will to the eyebrows, the lashes remain
a burning accusation. Nay, were even the eyelashes put
in mourning, there is a peculiarity of complexion induced

by the coating of the epidermis, as ineffaceable as the
blackness of the Ethiopian or the spots of the leopard.
I scarcely wondered that Lady Ormington should give up
Julia as hopeless. Who would marry her ? - Who per.
petuate in his race a stigma so repellent ? -Unless Miss
Mary and Miss Agatha were kind enough to die, leaving
her their heiress, she must inevitably succeed to their
honours of honourable single blessedness.
I have survived to see wondrous reforms in Great
Britain, even leaving out of the question that of its United
Parliament. In the days of my cockadehood, it was cited
as an exemplary thing on the part of the charming Lady
Ormington, to have even one of her three children sprawl-
ing in her dressing-room. The elegiac poets wrote verses
about it; and every other ugly little anecdote affecting her
renown, was hushed at the clubs by the rejoinder of —
“ but then she is such a mother !"-
The cockade generation of succeeding times is far better
off in the world. The cockade generation of to-day is at
a premium. One might fancy all the little boys one meets
were heirs apparent, and all the little girls, countesses in
embryo. For them the Tyrian murrey swimmeth. They
are not only clothed in purple and fine linen, Flanders lace
and Oriental cashmeres, but we hear of nursery governesses,
nursery footinen, the childrens' carriage, the childrens' pair
of horses; and, Turkey being brought down from her
stilts, the only despotism extant in Europe is the nursery-
archy of Great Britain, with its viziers and janizaries, -
head nurses and apothecaries, - ladies' doctors and Lilli-
putian warehouses. — I thank Heaven I was born a cox-
comb, for coxcombs are bachelors by prescriptive right;
and it would have stung me to the soul to find myself tied
down like Gulliver, in my middle age, by the authority of
a regiment of pigmies.
To return to my mother. No sooner had Julia grappled
herself so fast to the fond bosoms of her maiden aunts that
they proposed to her parents retaining her as a permanent
inmate, than Lady Ormington was pleased to accomplish
the recovery of her health. Luckily for her, a great revo-
lution had occurred during her seclusion : and revolutions

in politics have the singular faculty of accomplishing revo-
lutions in dress, as the moment-hand and hour-hand of
a dial are actuated by the same movement. The Reign of
Terror had frightened people out of their wits, and out
of their hair-powder. Buckles had given place to shoe-
ties; and love-locks and chignons to crops à la victime,
and à la guillotine. London, it is true, had not approached
nearer to revolutionary terrors than by making a bonfire of
Lord Mansfield's wig and MSS. But being accustomed
to accept its fashions from Paris, neat as imported, their
powder went off, and their locks were polled, as though
the clubs and the coteries of St. James's Street and Hano-
ver Square had prepared themselves for the cart or the
scaffold.
The transformation thus effected was peculiarly favour-
able to Lady Ormington. The hair, so long snowed over
by the powder-puff, came out a rich auburn; and in her
Roman crop and a tunic à i Agrippine, she was still a
bewitching creature. Several of her adorers underwent
a relapse ; and we all know that a relapse is the most fatal
period of a disorder.
All I now knew of her ladyship's triumphs, however,
was derived from the newspapers. I was banished from
her presence, from the moment of my degradation into
a schoolboy. Even when matriculated at Christchurch,
I remained an exile from her maternal good graces. On
taking leave of her on my way to the University, she
complained bitterly that my father should send me to
Oxford. “What was the use of college ? - I should only
become a brute of a fox-hunter ! - It was quite enough
for John to acquire a taste for buckskins and High Tory-
ism, without infecting me with those Oxonian propensities.
She wished me to go straight into the Guards. I knew
quite enough for the Guards. The humiliation of mater-
nity would be less galling, if she had a son in the Guards.
In the Guards, I should be on the spot to swear at her
chairmen when drunk, or her coachman if disorderly.
John was unpresentable ; but, if properly drilled and
tutored, dressed and re-dressed, she should not be so much
ashamed of Cecil."

An involuntary smile overspread my features while
hinting my suspicions that I was intended by my father
for the Church ; and a faint shriek burst from Lady
Ormington's lips at the announcement. The horror of
being mother to a parson,-a licensed dealer in sermons-
a privileged preacher of prose, a fellow in a black coat,
holding a patent to exhort her to repentance! After all,
I believe some feeling of maternal affection lingered at the
bottom of her heart; for, as I held the salts-bottle to her
nose, she faintly ejaculated, “ Cecil! were I to see you in
a shovel-hat, I would not survive it!” —The idea of the
cockade of my infancy, the Antinous curls of my boyhood,
giving place to a shovel, was too much for her ! -
It would have been far too much for me! I, Cecil
Danby, whose name was already whispered in St. James's
Street, as having taxed my bill at the Christopher on
account of a semi-tone too much in the complexion of the
vil de perdrix,-1, to be swamped in a country-parsonage !
It is true, my father's church patronage was such as a
bishop might have envied ; it is true, his lordship’s parlia-
mentary interest was such as might in time have made me
a bishop. — But then the wig! —“Angels and ministers
of Grace' (and of the Church of England,) defend us, -
the episcopal wig! I could almost as soon have borne to
defy the derision of puppy-life as a Judge or a Lord
Chancellor !
It did not much signify. Alma Mater proved as little
in conceit with me as Lady Ormington. In less than a
year of my matriculation, I was rusticated: why, it is not
my province or pleasure to communicate to the reader. If
my contemporary, he may happen to know ; if my junior,
let him read, mark, and learn in the archives of my college.
Le secret d'ennuyer est celui de tout dire ; and autobio-

lege life, - a cursed vulgar, stupid thing in itself, - has
been written down still lower of late years by smart
periodicals and fashionable novelists. Instead, therefore,
of sketches of Christchurch in the year of (dis)grace
180—, suffer me to favour you, gentle public, with the
“ Portrait of a Young Gentleman,” as I figured that season
in the eyes of the fair sex and the foul, in the city of high-
churchmen and sausages.
Standing five feet seven in my pumps, and five feet ten
in my boots, with a trifling hint of the Piping Faun
softening the severity of my Roman nose and finely-
chiselled inouth, I should, perhaps, have passed for
effeminate, but that the sentimental school was just then
in the ascendant. People went to the play to cry at the
• Stranger” or “ Penruddock," and subscribed to a circu-
lating-library to weep over “ The Father and Daughter.”
The severest poetry tolerated by May Fair was that of
Hayley, William Spencer, and Samuel Rogers. In short,
people had supped full of horrors during the Revolution,
and were now devoted to elegiac measures. My languid
smile and hazel eyes were the very thing to settle the
business of the devoted beings left for execution.
Self-reliance was one of the strong points of my
character. I had always a predisposition to woman-
slaughter, with extenuating circumstances, as well as a
stirring consciousness of the exterminating power. But,
as the most tremendous-looking piece of ordnance is non-
existent for her Majesty's service, till after progressing
through the department of the proving-house at Woolwich
Warren, I almost blushed for my own beauties, till they
had been labelled with the fiat of “ deadly poison ” by the
experience of the angelic sex.
I attained my majority without a catastrophe - the
cause of much heart-burning, but not a single heart-break!
The plebeian conquests of the University, or the sighs of
the lady’s-maid and vicar's daughter at Ormington Hall,
are unworthy of record ; their sensibility being quite as
much at the service of my elder brother, with his frightful
phiz and ill-built coat. My pen lends itself only to
adventures proper and specific to the Honourable Cecil
Danby, the arch-coxcomb of his coxcombical times,

Not that I was without rivals near the throne. At
Oxford, where my acquaintance lay more among the
moderns than the ancients, I picked up, or truth to say,
was picked up, by a man – ay, a man! – though I, but
six months his junior, remained a boy, — destined to play
a distinguished part on the stage of puppyism. In the
course of my first lounge down the High Street, I was
rash enough to show my rawness by inquiring the name of
a figure much resembling one of the models serving as
signs to a Parisian clothes-shop; and, “Not know Jack
Harris ? ” was the bitter reproof of my ignorance concern-
ing one never, of course, heard of beyond the bounds of the
University.
I did not know Jack Harris; and I suspect no one
knew him less than my rebuker, who was no other than
my whipper-snapper cousin Lord Squeamy. But I was
willing to extend my knowledge ; and Squeamy accordingly
chirrupped in my ear that Harris was a nobody, who had
made himself somebody, and gave the law to everybody.
This was accomplished per force of some talent and much
impudence. Squeamy did not call it impudence. The
word was too substantive for his puny lips. He called
it coolness. “Jack Harris' was the coolest fellow in the
world !”
“ A man of family ?”
" Nobody knows.”
“A man of fortune? ”
“Nobody has an idea."
“ He must indeed be cool and clever then,” was my
secret reflection, “to have kept his secret among people so
distinguished by inquisitiveness and ill-manners, as the
academic youth of Britain."
I soon discovered, in my proper person, that Jack
Harris was something more than impudent. He was
impertinent. Impudence is the quality of a footman ; im-
pertinence, of his master. Impudence is a thing to be
rebutted with brute force; impertinence requires wit for
the putting down. Had Jack Harris been simply im-
pudent, he would have been repaid with a kick; he was
impertinent, and his superiority was recognised by a low
bow.

His talents, meanwhile, received still higher recognition.
Some time previous to my rustication, Jack Harris took an
honour. He had probably tact to perceive that he was not
sufficiently well-born to aspire to the honours of duncehood.
It sat well upon such fellows as Squeamy and myself to
defy all pretence to scholarship ; for in college life, there
is no middle course for a nobleman. A lord must be cited
either for the highest acquirements, or the boldest con-
tempt of them ; whereas your Jack Harris, or your John
Thompson, Esquire, is bound to afford evidence of possess-
ing the plebeian use of his faculties. Harris quitted college,
accordingly, with the reputation of being an excellent
scholar, wanting only application to be the first man of his
year. No one had ever seen him with a book or a pen in
his hand; and my subsequent knowledge of him has often
led me to conjecture how hard must have been the course
of secret study, by which he enabled himself to reconcile
the pursuits of a man of pleasure with the acquirements of
a sap.
The first thing that startled me in Jack, was his refusing
to make my acquaintance. I could detect the negative air
with which he received a proposal to that effect, whispered
by that ninny of ninnies, Squeamy. Involuntarily, his
eyebrow became elevated, and his lip depressed ; saying as
plain as lip and eyebrow could speak, “thank you — I
know quite enough of the family.” At that moment I
should have had much pleasure in knocking him down;
but, as I said before, it is impudence and not impertinence
that challenges physical correction. I accordingly prepared
myself for moral castigation of his offence.
Ten days afterwards, at the close of a supper party in
which I distinguished myself by the display of certain

carelessly requested the favour of an introduction.
Squeamy's lack-lustre eye was upon me. I saw a smile
of triumph almost irradiate his unmeaning face, evidently
anticipating an act of retribution. Had he been at my
elbow, he would doubtless have suggested a dead cut.

offering my hand to the offender. “ The acquaintance

cannot fail to be a mutual benefit. I shall be proud to
place my rawness under the tutorage of Mr. Harris, as
regards the habits and customs of that part of his Ma-
jesty's dominions called Oxford ; and equally pleased to
afford him some hints concerning those of a less circum-
script region, denominated the world.”
The blow was felt, and resented as it deserved ; that is,
by a pressure of the hand denoting sympathy and bad
fellowship. As Saladin and Cæur de Lion rushed into
each other's embrace after the mutual trial of skill described
by Scott in “ The Talisman,” the two coxcombs recognised
each other's merits by a secret sign, mystic as the tokens of
free masonry-We became allies for life!
Jack Harris was an amusing fellow,— that is, amusing
for the University. I should never have got rusticated,
but from the ennui consequent upon his quitting Oxford.
In my own defence, I was forced to descend to the vulgar
exploits of gownsmen to keep myself awake.
On arriving in town after undergoing the extreme
penalty of the law of the University), I underwent, of
course, a further sentence of parental condemnation.
Lord Ormington favoured me with a longer sentence than
I had ever heard from his lips. “ I expected no better
of you,” said he ; “ you have disgraced yourself, and done
justice to my prognostications.” Lady Ormington merely
observed, “ Rusticated! — What is rusticated ?”—and on
learning that the verb had no reference to rusticity, was
satisfied that it meant something very incomprehensible
and very uninteresting ; like the capitals M. A. or D. D.,
which she had never been able to interpret otherwise, than
a Double Dose of Divinity, and More Anon of promised
preferment.
But Jack Harris was better versed in the obliquities of
the case, as well as more inclined to dissert thereon, than
either my genitor or genitrix.
“A sad affair !” said he, gravely, at the conclusion of
my narrative. “I fear, my dear Cec, (or as the Clubs
would write it) Cis, you stand convicted of heinous vulga-
risms. Think how your prospects in life might be injured
by the rumour that you have condescended to break lamps,

and carry your poodle to chapel, like any other blackguard
of fashion. With respect to expulsion, to a man in your
position in life it is rather a feather in your cap. Next to
a high honour, it was your only mode of obtaining college
eminence. You had no professional prospects to injure ;
and people of the world attach little importance to the
pranks of a gentleman commoner, which implies only a
sillier sort of schoolboy."
Instead of being affronted, I congratulated him in my
turn upon the exquisiteness of the little London snuggery
in which he had installed himself.
“I don't complain!” replied Jack, looking round, with
an air of ineffable coxcombry, upon furniture composed of
the richest foreign woods and marbles. "I am an easy
fellow in these particulars. Provided things are clean and
comfortable, I make no pretence to ostentation.”
“ I suspect you have a pretension to nonostentation,”
said 1,-" the less vulgar affectation, perhaps, of the two."
"Not so bad, for a beginning !" retorted Jack Harris,
coolly. “You are, however, safe in venting your sarcasms
on my establishment; for it will be long enough before
you incur retaliation by a household of your own. Yours,
my dear Cis, will be the poet's and the younger brother's
portion, an airy attic, containing three cane-bottomed
chairs and a painted chest of drawers."
“ Had you heard the admonishment with which Lord
Ormington received me this morning, you might have
judged it problematical whether he would afford me either
lodging or board !” said I, laughing.
“ You would be bored enough, I fancy, by any lodging
he could afford ;” cried Jack. “ His lordship's lodging
would prove harder than board."
" I should be somewhat soft to accept it,” replied I.
“ If I can persuade him to continue my Oxford allow-
ance, I will look out a bachelor den, within distance of the
Clubs and the Opera, and —”
“ Get through the probation of your whelphood as best
you may !” interrupted Jack. “ Cis, my boy !--take my
advice on the matter. So long as you can, live at free
quarters. If I had Lord Ormington's house in Hanover

think you, of rent and taxes at the rate of ten guineas per

have my way to make in town; yours is made for you.
Between ourselves, Cis, it was my intention, on quitting
Oxford, not to consort with a single fellow less than ten
years my senior. At your age and mine, one must live
for one's improvement. No man has a right to study his
pleasure or convenience, till after thirty. It takes till then
to make up his mind and his character. Once established,
let him follow the bent of his inclinations."
“ You intend, then,” cried I, interrupting him, “to
improve yourself by the society of fogrums?”—
" I intended, - but I recant. You, my old chum, shall
march hand in hand with me in the path of perfection-
ment. We have been boys together, we will cease to be

the object of what you call making up a character. But
for my part, I frankly tell you that, having as you say
Lord Ormington's house, cook, and cellar,—such as they
are, — to fall back upon, I shall give myself no great
trouble about the matter. You observed just now that I
was able to dispense with scholarship. I consider myself at
least as well able to dispense with the labour of ambition.”

love of a waistcoat ? ” said I, perceiving that Jack was
nettled at finding his affectation outdone, and his air of
patronage discountenanced.
" It was got for me,” he replied, with a peculiar smile.

soon the Continent may close again, to the utter discou-
ragement of our attempts at humanization. There is only
Paris for a waistcoat !- London produces buckskins and
boots, — Germany has its coats, — but nothing like Paris
for a waistcoat !”—
I saw he was determined I should inquire into the origin
of his, and disappointed him. But I could scarcely sup-
port the air avantageux with which he first glanced at
the pattern, and then at me, as if with a tacit assertion of
superiority. That the waistcoat was neither French nor a
gift I was persuaded. Jack would not, however, have
troubled himself to assume the air of a man à bonnes
fortunes, but for a foregone conclusion.
“ By the way, Cis,” said he, when, after taking leave of
him, I was about to retread the miniature staircase carpeted
to the brink, so that neither the blind mole nor Jack Harris
could hear a foot fall, — “one little piece of advice, — the
advice of a man who has six months the start of you on
the pavé - in our case more than six years — the smart of
my experience being yet recent. -- Drop Oxford! Be not
a hint of the damned spot' perceptible, either in the
garnish of your discourse or of your garments. A man
fresh from the University is leavened with slang or
pedantry. Avoid both !-Cut the college cut,—or prepare
to be cut in your turn !”
I could have killed him for the protecting air with which
he uttered this warning. I was Lord Ormington's son,
that is, I was Lady Ormington's. Who was Jack Harris,
that he should assume to be a plummet over me? Alas !
it was less who he was, than what he was, that endowed
him with the right! He was a monstrous clever fellow;
or, with a problematical fortune and doubtful origin, he
would not have come to be called Jack Harris by the best
men of his time.
Next to the mortification of Harris's nonchalance, was
the dryness of my father. Lord Ormington, indignant at
losing in me the family incumbent of a family living of
two thousand a year, referred me, in the fewest possible
words, in the fewest possible days after my arrival in town,
to his men of business, Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch, of

Southampton Buildings, for intimation of his paternal pro-
jects for my advancement in life.
There is something offensive in being despatched, even
by one's father, to Southampton Buildings. When a gen-
tleman intends to shoot you, he refers you to his friend;
when to persecute you according to the law, to his man of
business. I felt the menace as it was intended ; but I
went. Old Hanmer was my father's man. In such firms,
there is usually a thinking partner and a talking partner.
Hanmer was the talker; the partner who received orders
from the clients, while Snatch gave orders to the clerks.
I had seen him once or twice in my boyhood at Orming-
ton Hall, when he brought down a post-chaise full of
deeds to be executed, and carried up a post-chaise full
of venison or pheasants on which execution was to be
done. Hanmer had a good-humoured jocular face, of
most unlawyer-like promise; and was especially odious to
me as a man who made merry with a solemn subject. I
never liked Shakspeare's grave-diggers; and above all
things I hate a comical physician or punning lawyer,
whose good humour is as' nauseous as the lump of sugar
appended to a black dose prepared for the use of schools.
I was compelled to swallow him, however, or, at least,
consult him as the way-post of my future career. Having
borrowed a horse of Jack Harris, I sauntered, at an hou
when least likely to find Christians in the streets, and
most likely to find a lawyer at his office, towards what
have since been facetiously denominated by the press, the
wilds of Bloomsbury.
The irritation of my mind probably rendered me inarti-
culate in my inquiries of a pepper-and-salt nondescript
that opened the door; or, perhaps, my appearance announced
a person somewhat different from the usual clients of
Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch. For instead of conveying
me into the chambers of the old lawyer, Pepper-and-Salt
ushered me to a barn on the first floor, which, I suppose,
called itself by courtesy a drawing room.
Having desired me to “ please to step in,” which I did
please, a certain confusion at a table in one corner of the
room made it apparent that some one else was pleased to
step out. There was a lady seated at the table, writing,

drawing, sketching — no matter what, who had her back
towards me. But as there were petticoats in the case, I
took Jack Harris's advice, forgot Oxford, and was civil;
begging I might not disturb her, and feeling, with perfect
sincerity, that whether old Hanmer's drawing-room con-
tained or not a piece of quizzical human furniture in addition
to its quizzical chairs and tables, mattered not a jot.
Advancing towards the fire-place, though it was April
and the weather balmy, I took up that national position on
the hearth-rug, from which John Bull, like
Andes, giant of the western star,
Looks from his throne of clouds o'er half the world;
and in the present instance overlooked something, which
was something worth looking at.
The fire-place commanded the table where old Hanmer's
better half or quarter, — his wife, or daughter, or niece,
was fussing together her rattletraps preparatory to escape.
I suppose it was the recollection of Jack Harris's waistcoat
that determined me to stare her out of countenance. For
to own the truth, my practice was to include in one vast
horde (good to sew on buttons, get up fine linen, and
compound cheese-cakes, all that portion of the sex not
entitled to walk at a coronation or kiss hands on a birthday.
A single glance, however, at the beautiful creature wbo
was shutting up her writing-box in the corner of old
Hanmer's humdrummery, brought a flush of surprise to
my cheek and a stammering apology to my lips.
Never had I seen so sweet a face, so graceful a figure!
Falling shoulders, trimly waist, a profusion of chesnut
curls, falling from the smallest head I had ever seen,
on either side a throat as white as it was slender, all
were exquisite ! There was an air of elegance, more
distinguished than even the air of fashion, in the girl ;
and though her mourning dress was simple to homeliness,
she seemed far from oppressed by a sense of my affability,
when I once more “ begged that I might not disturb her,
as I was merely waiting the arrival of Mr. Hanmer.”
She requested me to take a seat, much as Lady Orming-
ton might have offered the same courtesy to her apothecary,
and left the room !

My first impulse, on her departure, was to turn round
and look in the glass; no uncommon movement with
me, certainly; but, on the present occasion, it was ac-
companied by a note of interrogation, rather than admira-
tion. I wanted to ascertain why this girl of Hanmer's
had been able to confront me without confusion. Had I,
in anticipation of my fusty visit to my father's man of
business, neglected to arm myself with my usual imple-
ments of destruction ? — No!— My tie was sublime, my
shirt frill of “lawn as white as driven snow ;' my buck-
skins and tops unimpeachable! (Shudder not, gentle
reader, and more especially reader fair ! for I write of a
year whose decimal is zero, 180—!) There was every
reason the young lady's civilities should be incoherent, and
her curtsey tremulous. I felt, therefore, inexpressibly
injured by her self-possession.
My meditations were interrupted by the entrance of old
Hanmer, rubbing his hands and drawing in his breath
with a hissing inspiration, while good-humour shone upon
his cushioned cheeks, and sparkled in the cold blue eyes,
which looked as if they had frozen into icicles the shaggy
white eyebrows like stalactites, hy which they were over-
hung. I abhor people who enter a room rubbing their
hands, and drawing in their breath! It is the favourite
entrée en scène of dentists, attorneys, and other excruciators
of the public mind and body. My bow to the man of
business was studiously indicative of repugnance.
“ Glad to see ye, Mr. Danby — glad to see ye ! - Take
a chair ! ” — cried he, not a whit abashed by the non-
extension of my hand to meet the one he offered. I saw
by his nonchalance that my father had invested him with
some sort of authority over me, — that he was to be bully
en chef, or en second.
“My lord pretty well this morning ?”- continued he,
after I had fastidiously chosen a chair. “I had the honour
of seeing his lordship yesterday forenoon ;” and he spoke
with a sort of proprietary feeling of my lord, as if in daily
attendance upon his moral nature like the apothecary upon
his gout.
“ Lord Ormington sent me hither, sir,” said I as

grandly as twenty-and-a-half, with its modicum of beard
and whiskers, is able to look at a barbose old monster of
sixty-five,“ to learn his pleasure on the subject of my future
career.” And I tried to insinuate into my tone an impli-
cation that my father's pleasure and my own were not
necessarily concorporate.
Old Hanmer regarded me with the complacent smile of
pity with which the Ogre may have examined the con-
dition of Hop-o'-my-Thumb, ere he put him by in a
child-coop to be killed when wanted for table. The man
of business had no mind, perhaps, to grind my bones to
make his bread, because at present my bones were marrow-
less as those of Banquo's ghost. He saw that I should
make prettier pickings hereafter.
« My dear young gentleman,” said he, with the most
nauseous cordiality,“ it grieves me to be under the neces-
sity of explaining, in the name of my noble client Lord
Ormington, his heartfelt disappointment at the recent—”
I spare my readers the preamble. Most of them must
be capable of figuring to themselves the sermon of a rich
lord's man of business, commissioned to inflict an exhor-
tation upon a younger son. The pith of the argument
was — “ You can't go into the Church, Mr. Cecil Danby Vo
-you shan't go into the army. If you choose to embrace
a diplomatic career, there is an opening in the Foreign
Office. But I will neither accept the obliging offers of my
friend Lord Votefilch to advance you in diplomatic life,
nor continue your present allowance of four hundred per
annum, unless you pledge yourself to punctual rational
habits, and submission to the powers that be.”
I seemed to have acquired one of the indispensables
to my advancement in diplomatic life; for instead of
closing with the offer, 1 replied, with a countenance and
voice most mysteriously inconclusive, that “ I would re-
flect upon the proposal, and have the honour of delivering
my ultimatum in the course of a day or two.”
I had, of course, already made up my mind, -that is,
as much mind as I had to make up, -- to accept the offer.
Nothing could have suited me better. I had anticipated
a hundred horrors; - a residence on my father's Irish

estates (where the agency was worth two thousand a-year
and the rent-roll three); or extinction in a parsonage
with a private tutor, during the half-year still to elapse
previous to my coming of age. To a minor, half a year
is half a century ! - In that said month of April, with
the London season before me, I would not have bartered
the ensuing six months against an eventual mitre or
Mastership of the Rolls.
The career of diplomacy flattered my dearest ambitions.
Diplomacy is almost the only profession where a man gains
nothing by appearing a beast. Slovenliness is esteemed an
evidence of scholarship in almost every calling save that
which renders one the mouthpiece of kings, -— redeeming
their gracious majesties from the trouble of communicating
per speaking-trumpet from one end of Europe to the
other. Downing-street, exchanged only for some foreign
mission, enchanted me. The diplomatist's is a metro-
politan existence. The diplomatist is fated to progress,
like a child learning its alphabet, from capital to capital.
His post lies in some focus, concentrating the rays of civi-
lization, — his place is the bull's-eye of the target. The
diplomatist can never subside into the common-places of
life.
Instead, however, of making these cogent reflections
manifest to the man of business, I observed, rising at the
same time to take leave, that I regretted to have been the
means of driving Mrs. Hanmer from the room. I never
knew an old fellow of sixty-five who was not pleased at
having a pretty wife of eighteen ascribed to him, however
inveterate his bachelorhood; and a glance towards the
table and the writing-box served, of course, as note expla-
natory to my erroneous text.
“ Mrs. Hanmer ? -" repeated he, exactly in the tone
I had anticipated. “Oh! ay,- you mean Emily.-It
was no interruption, my dear sir. I was expecting you
this morning. - I had desired you should be shown in
here. - It was her own fault if she did not choose to
remain in her room.”
To me, the fault appeared a venial transgression. The
case was clear. “Emily,” whether Miss Hanmer or Miss

Anything else, had evidently heard of Cecil Danby, and
wished to ascertain if common fame had been a flatterer.
But then, since aware that the daughter of Lord Orming-
ton's man of business had the honour of standing in the
presence of Lord Ormington's son, why was not her
deportment more demonstrative of her consciousness of the
fact?
Determined to vouchsafe no interest in her favour, and
looking unutterable solemnities at old Hanmer in rebuke
to his voluble familiarity, I made my parting bow.
On entering the house, I had taken little heed of the
meanness of the staircase, or the unworthiness of the thing
in pepper-and-salt; considering it all highly becoming in
the abode of my father's attorney. If attorneys had houses
with staircases and serving men, such was probably hoc
genus omne : but as I went out, it struck me with disgust
that a being so inexpressibly lovely as Emily, nay, so tho-
roughly on a par, in manners and appearance, with any
Lady Emily I had ever seen announced in my mother's
drawing-room, should be condemned to so mediocre an
existence.
The creaking stair, — the yellow paint, omitted in a
central stripe intended for a carpet, though carpet there
was none,—the dirty hall, with its worn-out floor-cloth,-
the very street-door, with its unsightly bolts and chains,
were such as should never have met those soft eyes, over-
shaded by such lashes, and gracing a countenance worthy
alike of a diamond coronet or a garland of roses.
Southampton Buildings, however, was not the place for
a soliloquy. So, throwing a shilling to the boy holding
Jack Harris's horse at old Hanmer's door, and trusting
that Emily might be peeping from the window of her
room, I leaped into my saddle with the air of the Chevalier
Bayard, and made the best of iny way towards the haunts
of civilization,

CHAPTER II.
Immortalia mortali sermone notantes.-Lucret. I. v.
Comme les gens dont la taille est bien prise, il s'habillait avec esprit, et se
portait une espèce de culte.
MICHEL RAYMOND.
I had seen little of my brother during my college days.
John was a Cambridge man. John, as became his ugliness,
had taken honours; and John, as also became his ugliness,
was not only devoted to study, but pursuing it at Orming-
ton Hall. He usually remained there, long after the rest
of the family were settled in Hanover Square ; and even
when in town, seemed to take delight in maintaining the
same distance between himself and my mother now he was
a man, that she had maintained betwixt herself and him
when he was a boy. With my father's sanction, he occu-
pied sober lodgings of his own, not very far from the
residence of his maiden aunts; and, except when Lord
Ormington gave a political dinner, seldom dined at home.
This suited me extremely. John was still the same
ponderous lump of clay banished by its mamma to the
nursery in its infancy, and self-banished to the study in
its maturity ; and I felt that to be seen walking down
St. James's Street, hooked to the arm of such an elder
brother, would be to stand for my picture to Dighton. I
accordingly established myself with him on the footing of
“How are you, John ? "_" How are you, Cecil ?” and as
such intimations of fraternal coolness are by no means un-
common in that model-country of the domestic affections,
Great Britain, no one was surprised to see us nod to each
other in the street, aware that we must have nodded in
each other's company in all other times and places.
Jack Harris noted with a smile, that “'twas no wonder
we should dislike each other, without a feature or idea in
common ;” and as Lord Ormington's and his elder son's
ideas and features were not only in common, but uncom-
monly common,-extraordinairement ordinaire, — I was by
no means jealous of their sympathies.
My father was a man such as one rarely sees out of

England ; reserved, without being contemplative, - con-
vivial, without being social ;-— not mistrustful, yet having
confidence in nobody ; cold, unexpansive, undemonstrative ;
fulfilling his petty duties so gravely, as to impress people
with a notion they were of some consequence; and by his
gravity of air and paucity of words imparting a tone of
mystery to his insignificance.
He seemed afraid of letting himself know what he was
about. Yet he had nothing to fear. God knows he never
did anything worth speaking of! He was a moral man.
His business with Hanmer, with his banker, or with Lord
Votefilch, might have been transacted at Charing Cross
without discredit to his public virtue, or private virtues.
Yet he seemed to dread that even his own man should be
aware on Tuesday that on Wednesday he had an appoint-
ment with either of the three ; and as to his wife - but
for that reserve there was, perhaps, sufficient motive.
When, at the close of two days' cogitation, I approached
him with the intention of signifying my acceptance of his
terms, it did not surprise me to find myself a second time
referred to Southampton Buildings. “On everything re-
lating to business,” he said, " it was his wish to commu-
nicate with me through a third person.”
But that I anticipated some such regulation, I should
not have volunteered my “ultimatum” to his lordship. It
was my intention to make my way a second time up the
creaking staircase, lacking a carpet; and lest the sang-froid
evinced by Emily at our last interview should prove the
means of disappointing me, I rode straight to Hanmer's
door, without warning or appointment.
“ Mr. Hanmer was not at home, and Mr. Snatch had
quitted London on business, by the Leeds mail, the pre-
ceding night.”
The murmured ejaculation, not intended to reach beyond
my lips, unluckily caught the ear of Pepper-and-Salt.
I could speak to the head-clerk if I liked. The head-
clerk would be disengaged in the course of a quarter of an
hour.
Satan, or some other of the invisible esquires of the body
to Adam's grandsons, at that moment seemed to flourish

before my eyes the waistcoat of Jack Harris, which I had
seen dazzling the eyes of Fop's-alley the preceding night.
“ Be so good as to inform Miss Emily,” said I, “ that I
have a message to leave with her, from Lord Ormington.”
The latter name had an instantaneous effect upon Pepper-
and-Salt. It was that of the presiding divinity of the
house of business of Hanmer and Snatch. The deed-
boxes most reverentially lodged of their whole cliency,
were those inscribed with the designation of the Right
Honourable> Lord Ormington,” —their solitary link with
the peerage. It was from the park and preserves of
Ormington Hall, that corn, wine and oil, haunches of
venison and leashes of pheasants,—reached the meagre
kitchen of the firm. To Pepper-and-Salt, accordingly, his
lordship appeared to be the fountain of all goodness,—the
King of Cockaigne,- a man to be venerated even in the
person of his messenger.
Without further hesitation, he conducted me once more
into the drawing-room ; then hurried off, observing, that
he would see whether Miss Emily could be spoken to.
For there was no Miss Emily in the chilly chamber, no
fire in the grate, no writing-box on the little table. Her
intrusion on the last occasion had perhaps excited the
displeasure of her father, and brought down upon her a
sentence of perpetual banishment. In that case, she would
not now venture to obey my summons.
In so short a time, however, as to afford no hope that
she had added a single touch to her toilet on the announce-
ment of my name, the graceful creature who had produced
so startling an effect upon me at our first interview, glided
into the room. — Still no embarrassment, - still no emo-
tion! - Nay, she did not even request me to be seated ;
and I stood, looking like an oat, with my hat and riding-
cane in my hand, like a subject receiving orders from his
sovereign.
“ You wished to speak to me?" said the sweetest voice
I ever heard, as if in compassion to my awkwardness.
“ Understanding that Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch were
absent from town —” said I, wholly incapable of assuming
the tone of superiority I had premeditated -

so 'The clerks of the establishment, sir, are on the spot,
to supply their place,” observed Emily, almost haughtily.
“ I was anxious,” I stammered, as if not noticing her
interruption, “ to request the favour that you would charge
yourself with a confidential message to your father.”
In a moment, every part of Emily's person, that was
visible to eyes profane, became fushed by the deepest
crimson ; and her eyes seemed to dilate with some inex-
plicable emotion, — surprise, or indignation, or both. —
I saw that I was somehow or other confoundedly in the
wrong. She made no answer. But I neither dared
reiterate my question, nor hazard another. I was con-
scious of looking like a pickpocket.
“What do you wish me to communicate to Mr. Hanmer
on his return ?-” said she, after a minute's silence, and
in so subdued a tone, that indignation, at all events, was
not the passion I had excited.
“ Simply that you signify my acceptance of the terms
proposed to me through his mediation,” said I, not daring
to excite her surprise, by the preposterous fact that herself
and Mr. Hanmer of Southampton Buildings, were the
chain of communication between a peer of the realm and
his son, residing under the same roof.
“I have the honour of speaking to Mr. Danby ? —"
she inquired, coldly.
I bowed my affirmative.
“ I will not fail to deliver your message," she continued,
advancing her hand towards the bell, by way of an intima-
tion, and not a very gracious one, that my audience was
at an end. There was no remedy. Away I went, like
a beaten dog ; having effected nothing by my impertinent
intrusion, except a still deeper descent in Emily's opinion,
—and my own.
“ Southampton Buildings ! - an attorney's daughter !"
muttered I, as if to revenge myself by the contemptuous
inflexion with which I pronounced the words, when,
having attained the New Road, I galloped off in the
direction of the west-end. And again, the waistcoat of
Jack Harris seemed to flutter before my eyes, as a memento
of my insignificance in the field whose laurels are myrtles..

· On the strength of my “ultimatum," I was now
mounted on a horse of my own; as I had good reason to
discover, on encountering the smile of Jack Harris in
Rotten Row. Harris was one of those who never break
out into condemnation. A withering glance or smile was
sufficient. Towards myself, he affected indulgence. At
me, he looked leniently, as much as to say, “ poor fellow !
it is not his fault if taken in by a dealer to purchase a
beast disgraceful to a gentleman's stable.” At my elder
brother, he would have sneered outright; at such a fellow
as old Hanmer, gazed with horror. But his clemency was
far more galling than his utmost rigour of the law. A boy
can never stand being treated as a boy, more especially by
another boy assuming the importance of a man.
" Who was that with whom you were riding to-day in
the Park? —” observed my mother, (the Ormington vis-à
vis, now that Julia was rusticating with my aunts in the
country, permitting itself to be seen once more in the
ring.)
“A college-chum."
“ A what? -" reiterated my mother, opening her eyes
as wide as Emily had done that morning, but without the
accompanying blush.
“ Jack Harris, a Christchurch-man," said I, not deign-
ing to notice the shrug with which she listened to the
announcement.
“ Yet he had nothing of the horrible Oxford cut?"
observed my mother, as if muttering to the spaniel nestling
under her white hand on the sofa. At that moment,
Harris's warning about dropping the University, recurred
to my mind.
" It will give you pleasure, perhaps, to learn,” said I,
perceiving that she was about to coax herself as well as
her lap-dog into a doze, -“that Lord Ormington has
procured me a clerkship in one of the public offices.”
" A WHAT! —” again reiterated my mother, twenty
times more shocked than at my Oxonianism.
“A clerkship. As soon as I can compass a legible
hand and the rule of three, I am to be provided for by
Government, at the rate of 751. per annum.”

.“ You have not surely accepted ? ” exclaimed my
mother, shoving away poor Bibiche with more vivacity
than I had ever seen her exhibit. _“He has no right to
expose you to such a degradation !—That were a breach of
all our compacts!”
In compassion to her emotion, I condescended to ex- 7
pound, that the 751. per annum, at twenty, was a neces-
sary preliminary to the ambassadorial 12,0001. per annum
crowning a diplomatic career; and that, of my brother
clerks in the office, three were sons of Earls and four of
Members of Parliament.
« So that, some day or other, you will be an ambas-
sador? ” said she, resuming her languor and her spaniel.
« Deo, or rather, diabolo volente!" I replied.
“ In that case, I am glad you are going to stay in town,"
said she. “I will give you one of my Opera-tickets, and
introduce you to the Duchess of Moneymusk. I dare say
you will get on very well. When Lord Ormington said
something about the necessity for your living at home to
redeem your character after disgracing yourself at Oxford,
I thought it would be a bore. But if you manage pro-
perly, you need not be in any one's way !-You have only
two things to avoid, -play and politics. Play and politics 1 /
are for elder sons. It would be the making of John to go
into Parliament, or upon the turf. But John is such a
stupid young man, that there is no doing anything with
him! John does nothing but read. John was never
intended to play a gentleman's part in the world.”
- And how do you recommend me to fill up my time?"
said I, by way of humouring her absurdity.
“Not in exhibiting yourself as the companion of a
Mr. Harris, whom one never heard of,” she replied.
“ Ah! my dear Lady Harriet, how are you?” cried she,
interrupting herself, on perceiving that a pretty little
woman had entered the room, unnoticed by either of us.
“ You are come to take me to the Duchess's Loo, and I
have not even begun to dress !”
“ Make haste, then,” replied her friend, dragging a chair
to the front of the fire, and seating herself as if at home.
“You forgot your appointment, I suppose, in the pleasure

who has got himself expelled from Oxford ?" she con-
tinued, addressing me over her shoulder, and extending
her hand towards a fire-screen, as if to command me to
reach it for her. The movement discovered to me the
pretty, but somewhat passé, face of a woman half a dozen
years younger than my mother, whom I had no difficulty
in recognising as one of the intimates of the fashionable
coterie collected round Lady Ormington since my settlement
at the University.
“And who cannot regret, still less repent, a step that
procures him the honour of presenting himself to Lady
Harriet Vandeleur,” said I, offering the screen with an air
of gallantry which I flattered myself was irresistible.
Her reply was a burst of laughter.
“ Is the Grandison style of set compliment still in vogue,
then, at our seats of learning ?” cried she, turning and
contemplating me from head to foot. “ My dear Lady

I was again on the point of being betrayed into a set
compliment, expressive of my delight at falling to the share
of such a preceptress. But something in the arch eyes of
Lady Harriet warned me to desist. She was an Irishwoman,
with a nuïveté bordering on effrontery. It would have been
effrontery in an ugly woman; but in the pretty, pouting,
piquante Lady Harriet, it was enchanting.
“ Is the cub to sit or stand, or will you permit him to
kneel ?” said I, falling into her vein, the moment my
mother quitted the room.
“ Your height and figure warrant my refusing you a
chair,” she replied. “But I have a mind to ascertain the
colour of your eyes, which flashed so furiously just now, at
my condescending to laugh at you. So even draw a chair,
and let me proceed in my investigation."
I replied, of course, to the summons, by falling at her feet.

“Not ill done, as regards the attitude,” said she,
examining me without embarrassment, “but a blunder as
regards the intention. By hazarding a burlesque declara-
tion, you admit your conviction that you shall never be
tempted into a serious one. In your ignorance whether I
am maid, wife, or widow, you are right : any, but the last,

mitted! So now, rise ; - gently, or you will throw

mington has the bad taste to encumber her rooms! Take
your seat yonder, with the modesty becoming the junior
member of the house ; and contrive, if you can, not to look
hampered in your own cravat.”
The étourderie of Lady Harriet struck me dumb. I
was tamed, as brutes are, by the coolness of their keepers.
I had not even courage to inform her that I was perfectly
aware of her being a rich widow ; very much disposed to
retain the right of having her own way,—that way not
being matrimonially eligible.
“Is it not a horrible vulgarism,” said she, (again
adverting to the china, that I might recover the breath of
which her sang-froid had deprived me,) “to cram a
habitable room with little tables showered over with

In my boyish susceptibility, I fancied she was talking
at me; my rooms at Oxford having been renowned for
their foppery. I stood accountant for as great a sin as
Lady Ormington, and consequently broke out bravely.

guest, and affords a diploma of taste to the possessor.
Whereas these less than nothings of Sèvres or enamel,
require a microscopic eye. Were Nollekens's Venus, for
instance, smiling upon her pedestal in yonder corner, I
should adore her in the distance, without losing sight
of Lady Harriet Vandeleur ; and enable myself to decide
at a glance whether the smallest foot in Europe, slippered
by Taylor, be not a prettier sight than the same charming
feature in its primeval symmetry.”
A merveille !” cried Lady Harriet. “Another time
don't call a foot a feature. It is William Spencerish.
The school is obsolete. Try reality. We are all pre-
tending to be natural with all our might, till the affectation
of nature has become as natural as any other affectation.
And now pray what is Mr. Cecil Danby going to do with
his younger sonship, after proving himself too wicked to
become a son of the mother Church ? --Not a man of
wit and fashion about town, I trust !- The ranks are
overflowing : -- an inundation of the nihil !- The army,
too, is out of date. Since the renewal of the war, nobody
has cared to go into any thing but the Household brigade ;
and the sort of creatures one used to country-quarter upon
the bogs and moors, come down upon us in hundreds and
tens of hundreds, even into the king's chamber. For pity's
sake, don't let us find you in the squadron.”
"I am about to devote myself to the cause of my
country in a more modest capacity,” said I, — “by
sketching dogs and horses on His Majesty's blotting paper

“Official ? ” — cried Lady Harriet, withdrawing 'her
feet from the fender, and throwing the lustre of her large
dark eyes full upon my face, as a watchman turns the
searching light of his lantern. “You are becoming
natural indeed !-- You are flinging away the poetry of
life with a vengeance !- Official ? — Have you reflected
on what it will be to extend your finger tips to mine,
black with the inky business of the state ? Have you
considered—”

room. “I have not heard Lord Ormington's carriage
drive off. I shall perhaps be in time to catch him on
his way to the House of Lords.”
“Let me recommend you not to jest with Lord
Ormington,” said she gravely, motioning me to be re-
seated ; “it is playing with edged tools. If you are
to be pushed by his interest in public life, accept and
be thankful.—Do you go with us to the Duchess's to-
night?"
“Am I to have that honour ? — I wait your Ladyship's
orders !—” said I, again mistaking myself and her so far
as to play the gallant.
“ Then I order you to stay at home. Nay, I order
you to stay at home till qualified for society. At present
you do not approach within millions of miles of even the
very small thing indispensable to obtain endurance among
us. You would easily make a sensation, but a sensation
is a vulgar triumph. To keep up the excitement of a
sensation, you must always be standing on your head,
(morally speaking,) and the attitude, like everything over-
strained, would become fatiguing to yourself and tedious
to others :- whereas to obtain permanent favour as an
agreeable well-bred man, requires simply an exercise of
the understanding. To ascertain whether you possess
one, get rid of your conceit.— Il faut apprendre à vous
effacer."-
“ I will learn anything you deign to teach me," said I.
“ But how could you teach me to be humble, when the
mere favour of your interest would a thousand-fold
increase the self-conceit you reprobate ? "
« From Oxford, yet a logician !—I thought young men
went to the University to get rid of their learning ?-How-
ever, for my own sake, I shall take you in hand. For as
it must be my fate to see a great deal of the pet son of my
bosom friend, it would be a serious evil were I always to
find him presuming, abrupt, and coxcombical as to-night.
Don't bristle up so furiously ; — you will gain nothing by
it but being laughed at. I tell you again, that the brus-
querie which sits well upon me, or rather which my beaux
yeux, and the beaux yeux de ma cassette united, cause to be

excused in me, would be detestable in a very young man
whose eyes are not particularly fine, and whose cassette is
more than questionable. To succeed among us, you must
reduce your laugh to a smile, your voice to a whisper, your
assertions to surmises. For some years to come, you have
no right to have an opinion of your own. You will be
coughed down by the most potent, grave, and reverend
signors,' who are ten years older than yourself. For it is
of them the jury is composed. The men of thirty carry
all before them in London ; – men old enough to pretend
to tact, but not to wisdom. As soon as we grow really
wise, we become indulgent; — witness myself, who am
three-and-thirty, — yet kind enough, in quoting your
deformities, to wish you may amend them. And now,
good night! I hear the rustling of Lady Ormington's
sarsnet, for which signal I am grateful, as I perceive
that you are about to explode."
I had in fact been making sundry efforts to interrupt
her, but without success. There was no putting down her
audacity.
“ Good night !” — said she, kissing her hand in the
Italian fashion. “ You are not yet sufficiently in my good
graces to admit of accepting your arm to the carriage.
Prove your docility by staying at home, while we proceed
to throw away our time, money, and temper at the card
table. Read some improving book,-Grammont's Memoirs,
or one of Madame de Souza's novels, which will teach
you good French and better manners.”
When, in spite of her prohibition, I had conducted her
to the carriage, and taken remarkably fast hold of the hand
which she placed on mine as she stepped in, I found
myself almost out of breath with pique and wonder.
I was a Christchurch man; yet here was a pretty
woman, who had both looked and talked me down. There
was only one word of her rambling discourse which
operated as a saving grace in Lady Harriet's favour. I
should have called her bold, - I should have called her
flighty, - I should have called her flippant, — nay, I
would have repeated after her own authority, that she was
three-and-thirty, and after my own, that she looked her

age ; but for the monosyllable “ yet !”– That “ yet”
was a peacemaker !-- She did not “ yet " like me suffi.
ciently, to put up with my boorishness.
This was throwing down the gauntlet. This was chal-
lenging a pretension. The ambitions of the Foreign
Office were too prolix for the hot blood of twenty and
six months. I might be an ambassador at forty, - an
ambassador with a bald head and chinchilli whiskers. The
prospect was too remote ! But a pretty woman who told
me so frankly, that she did not “ yet” like me, was a
more immediate incentive. I swore,- as my uncle Toby
swore, that Lefevre should not die,- that she should not
like me ;— that, by Heavens ! she should love me, – to
desperation, — to madness !-.
But to effect this, I recollected that I must begin with
falling in love myself. As I sauntered into the book-
room, to take down an edition of Grammont, which in its
gaudy suit of scarlet and gold, looked wonderfully like a
militia captain dressed for the levée, I muttered to myself
the ejaculation, which immortalized poor stupid Rocca,
by eventually uniting him with Madame de Staël : “ Je
l'aimerai tellement qu'elle finira par m'épouser !”– I am
not sure that I said épouser, - but it was à peu près. -
The fact is, marriage is no word for the lips of a younger
brother.
Next day, I contemplated Jack Harris's waistcoat with
calmness. I felt myself on the road to preferment. I
was convinced that there were waistcoats in the loom for
me, and consequently discovered that his was frightful :
za waistcoat calculated, according to Lady Harriet's
system, to produce a sensation,- to induce questions.
I had already ordered myself half a dozen of the plainest
pattern, and simplest fashion ; such as would enable no
one to swear, half an hour after parting from me, whether
I had a waistcoat on or not.
I took care not to utter a syllable to him, either of my
over-haughty attorney's daughter, or my over-familiar
fashionable widow. Time enough to talk about them
when I had something to boast of! To quote them pre-
maturely, and to a Jack Harris, might prevent my ever

having cause for boasting. I told him therefore, that I
had not accompanied Lady Ormington to the Duchess of
Moneymusk's, “because it was a bore.”
It was the fashion in those days, to call one's mother a
bore. Mothers have rather risen in the market since, and
fathers gone down. Fathers soon afterwards came to be
called “the governor;" but this was by the generation that
grew up in the nursery, before the nursery became coun-
cil-chamber to the house. The creatures who are cockading
it now-a-days, have every reason to call their parents your
Majesties, and address them on their knees, - I mean the
children on their own knees, not upon the knees of their
parents.
Jack Harris sank a fathom in my esteem, by the frank-
ness with which he allowed me to discern his surprise
that any one should think it a bore to go to the loo party
of a Duchess of Moneymusk ! — I was unaffectedly sur-
prised that any one should think a duchess worth thinking
of; not only because my head and heart were running
upon pretty widows and attorneys' daughters, but because
the habits of my youth familiarized me with social dis-
tinctions; and it would have been as difficult for a mere
duchess to impose upon the sprawling pet of Lady Or-
mington's boudoir, as for a man to be a hero to his valet-de-
chambre. Jack was no longer to me the infallible, — the
Solon,- the Lycurgus, — who had imposed his high-
sounding code upon my boyish inexperience.
His à plomb delighted me no longer. It was the à
plomb of the adroit mountebank, not of the graceful opera
dancer. His vivacity had lost its charm, - there was a
brazen twang in its note. The pirouettes and entrechats
of Lady Harriet, on the contrary, kept me constantly on
the qui-vive ; and her sallies, if they had not quite a
silver sound, were at least Corinthian metal. I saw that
though Jack Harris might do very well to launch me on
the waves of the great world, it was Lady Harriet who
must officiate as my pilot. Of the three modes in which
society may be contemplated, from above, below, or level
ground, I preferred the last. Since I was to live with
those of my own class, it was better to examine them on a

fair footing, and not from the point of view appropriate
to a parvenu like Jack Harris.
Quod petiit, spernit; repetit quod nuper omisit
Aestuat, et vitæ disconvenit ordine toto.
In the existing order of things, which condemned him
to an Ishmael's portion in the land, there was everything
to provoke his animosities or rouse his envy; but for me,
the son of the free woman, an aristocrat, one of the pri-
vileged, the malediction that became his lips, or the petty
arts indispensable to his progress in life, would have been
out of place. Our principles of action could never be in
common. He might be honest, — I must be honourable.
Generosity might become him ; from me, nothing short
of magnanimity would suffice. All this, at least, I whis-
pered to myself, as a plea for paying a long visit on the
morrow to Lady Harriet Vandeleur, and for merely nod-
ding to Jack Harris, as we crossed each other at a brisk
trot on Constitution Hill.
That night, I received a professional letter from Messrs.
Hanmer and Snatch. If there be an object in this world from
which every particle of the poetry of life is excluded, -
the very caput mortuum of the crucible of common-place,
it is a lawyer's letter. There is a savour of pounce
about it,- a dryness,- a sententiousness, - as if a pen
plucked from the wing of that dullest of birds, the owl,
had ministered to its indictment.—Yet, strange to say, I
tore open old Hanmer's long, narrow, wire-wove, wafered
epistle, his thirteen-and-two-pennyworth of epistolary civil-
ities, with an impatience savouring of the lover. “Je ne
suis pas la rose, mais j'ai vécu avec elle !” – Gods! that ever
the poetry of Hafiz should attach itself to a missive con-
veyed by the twopenny post from Southampton Build-
ings !-
Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch, (for old Hanmer addressed
me as Wolsey addressed the Pope, in the first person,
though hooking in rex meus into a parenthesis, “ for
partner and self,”) Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch informed
me, that Messrs. Drummond and Company had orders to
pay one hundred pounds a quarter to self or order ; and
that I was to present self, without further orders, on the

Monday next ensuing, at the office of His Majesty's Secre-
tary for Foreign Affairs, in Downing Street, where Lord
Votefilch would have the honour of explaining to me the
nature of my duties, and introducing me into the depart-
ment to which my services were devoted.
I did not pause to exult in the petty triumph of being
handed into office by one of His Majesty's ministers, while
Jack Harris would probably have been shouldered forward
by some junior clerk. I was examining the date of the
letter, as if there were magic in the words “ 13, South-
ampton Buildings !”—The sight of the Lesbian promon-
tory would scarcely have excited more emotion in the
heart of a young gentleman well grounded in his Ovid !-
I certainly had no reason to expect that old Hanmer, in
writing to me professionally, would hazard mention of
“ Emily :" yet strange to say, I did not reach the signature
of the letter without a sensation of disappointment. Some
emanation, some hint, some reference, some something, of
her, ought to have intermingled itself with that soulless
epistle !
Such was my mode of characterizing, at twenty-and-a-
half, a letter conveying a permanent income of four hun-
dred per annum, and an appointment leading in a direct
line to an embassy !-
I know better now!--Now, I can discern more poetry
in such a despatch, than in the collected works of Words-
worth and Byron !-

in disserting on Othello's tender rhapsody, whether the
whited-brown generalissimo originally complained that
his “ way of life," or his “ May of life," had “ fallen
into the sere and yellow leaf.” The quarto edition says
one thing, the folio edition says another thing, and the
various buzz-wigs, who have overlaid the great poet with
their leaden weight, say a hundred other contradictory
things.
I, Cecil Danby, decide for the “ May of life;" for
what so characteristic of youth and hope as May, - the
summer-month of the soul, whatever the calendar may
say to the contrary !
It was May when I took possession of my liberty, and
the town; and what a month it was to me!- Though in
point of fact, I became, for the first time, a slave, the
slave of the nation, on the trifling acknowledgment of
seventy-five pounds per annum, paid quarterly, I fancied
myself, for the first time, my own master. For I had
youth, health, spirits ; and the world, that ugly, old,
brown, leathery, football of Fate,- seemed to me then,
young, healthy, happy, hopeful as myself.— I looked upon
it as a fresh flower, bursting from its calyx, and exhaling
a thousand perfumes !— Pah! I could hold my nose now,
at the mere thought of its festering exhalations !-
Yet the world, errors and steam excepted, remains, I
suppose, pretty much as I found it. The eye of twenty-
and-a-half discerned only its passions and its picturesque ;
while the eye of - ty-and-a-half descries its turnpike-
roads and arch-hypocrisy.
Pass a sloe-leaf plucked from the nearest hedge through
the hands of half-a-dozen different men, and each shall
see it in a various point of view. The first, if a botanist,
will note its specific character; the second, if a chemist,
will opine upon its juices; the third, an artist, will descant
upon its colouring; and the fourth, a teaman, will examine
its eligibility to become Souchong or Bohea. Even so
differently do men decide upon the phases of society !-

of preferment awaited the all-subduing club of that great
Alcides, Cecil Danby. To Jack Harris, it was a game of
skill, where the cleverest player wins the greatest number
of courtcards,- Anglice, where a low-born man consorts
with the greatest number of lords and ladies. My brother
looked upon it as an unmeaning hubbub, interrupting the
great business of life ; i.e. the study of dusty, fusty,
musty tomes, in a musty, fusty, dusty library: and my
father, as a place where a man was compelled every
Christmas to the unprofitable waste of certain monies,
carefully screwed out of his tenants four times a-year.
Let posterity decide which was the greater blockhead !
-Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch would have stood out for
the wisdom of my father. The ghosts of Scaliger or
Dr. Valpy might have backed the Honourable John. The
parson of the parish, and Mr. N. P. Willis, would have
sided with Jack Harris. But, for my part, I had on my
side St. James's Street and the charming Lady Harriet
Vandeleur !—
On second thoughts, I am not so sure that London is
altogether now as then. When I said • steam excepted,”
I should have added “ smoke.” Every year, the atmos-
phere, as well as the plot, thickens. Every year manu.
factories arise in Southwark, to suffocate the denizens of
London and Westminster. We no longer send to Bir-
mingham for our buttons, or Dorchester for our ale. Like
some bumpkin Squire we take pride in brewing at home.
“ London's column,” though still “ a tall bully," has
rivals in a forest of steam-chimneys t'other side the water;
and, like other old foxes, we may end in being smoked out.
The suburbs, too, like a lady's hoop, have extended so
widely, as to treble the dimensions of the body they en-
close. The lungs of London are compressed by the en-
largement of the circumjacent membranes ; and the
atmosphere assigned her is not only less clear and salu-
brious, but her breathing pores are stopped up, and air-
vessels abridged. Her gardens are built over. Padding-
ton-fields smoke, like a cigar-divan, from thousands of
ignominious issues ; and Willan's farm, instead of feeding
hundreds of cows, affords lawn to five villas, dens to twenty

lions, and areas and dust-holes to five hundred genteel resi-
dences, “ for the reception of small families of respect-
ability.” The tree in St. Paul's Churchyard will soon be
the only green thing left to exalt the imaginations of our
sparrows by the rustling of its leaves; for, lo ! the builders
have passed like a swarm of locusts over the land, and left
all barren.
At the period of my début, I swear there was occa-
sionally a glimpse of blue sky over Hyde Park ! — Our
recent ambassador, M. le Doctrinaire Guizot, who, during
his first fortnight in London, was continually passing his
hand before his eyes, convinced by the mistiness of his
vision that cataract was impending, might have seen his
way clearly then to the affaires étrangères in a physical as
well as in a moral point of view.
I enlarge on all this, lest the dandies of to-day may find
it difficult to account for my boasted enjoyment of good
health and spirits. As regards the former, there was less
quackery in the world, — no homeopathy, no dephlogis-
tication; as regards the latter, less smother in the air.
People in general were more agreeable. Knowledge did
not pretend to be useful. Society now so blue, was couleur
de rose. There were almost as many courteous readers as
there are now writers; and authors were a sort of people
who dined with a great man on a Sunday, in their best
clothes, when, indeed, they had a coat to boast of. Like
mothers, they have since risen amazingly in the market.
They owe that to Scott and Byron. Sir Walter was the
first who wrote up authorship; and, to quote the words of
his lordly contemporary, “it was not the least conquest of
his fertilizing and mighty genius.”
But if there was little good writing in London during
the first half-dozen years of the nineteenth century, there
was a prodigious quantity of good talking. In war-time,
the dinners, from the hands of native cooks, were so in-
fernally bad, that diners-out were forced to have recourse
to colloquial entertainment. In the best days of Conver-
sation

your pointer a cur, and yourself an ass, by protesting that
the demi-lions on your tea-spoons are not armorial bear-
ings,) in the days I say, when these blanks were prizes at
a dinner-party,
Roast was the saddle, and the pudding boil'd;
and entrées, or as female cooks denominate them, “made-
dishes,” implied four anomalous compounds placed at the
angles of the table, and rarely impinged, emitting savours
of something between a perfumer's and an apothecary's
shop,- black, spicy, opaque, and mysterious, as one of
Radcliffe's romances. — Some such diet probably consti-
tuted
th' insane food
That took her reason prisoner,
ere she concocted “ The Italian.”
Now that these peppery substitutes for savoury viands
have given place to épigrammes d'agneau à pointes
d'asperges, the epigrams of the table-talkers have become
less pointed.
The fools who come to talk, remain to eat ;
and the light soufflés and piquant Mayonnaise stop their
mouths with a bonne bouche, instead of a bon mot.
I have proved to my own satisfaction, at least, (by way
of taper burnt to the memory of the dead,) that those in
possession of the ear of the town were better worth hear-
ing. I would fain prove, in order that a tribute to the
fair sex may keep in countenance my tribute to the foul,
that those in possession of its eyes, were better worth
looking at. Who will deny the beauty of the Howards,
Villierses, — two Lady Williams whom I could name, and
two or three Lady Others, whom I can not; to say
nothing of my friend Lady — , next to Fountains
Abbey, the finest ruin extant. — They were loveliness
itself!-Witness the miniatures of Mrs. Mee,— witness
the journals of Sir Lumley,- or the ghost of Harry Mel-
lish. It is true they enabled one to judge somewhat
too accurately of their symmetry. In the scanty gowns
into which they were squeezed, like pillows into their
cases, little was left for the imagination ; whereas, in the
present day, beauty in her five-and-twenty breadths of

petticoat, lies concealed, like the mummy of Cheops within
the labyrinths of the great pyramid.-
Lady Harriet Vandeleur was just the fairy on whom
these tight-fitting habiliments sat to admiration ! — With
her snow white skin, fair ringlets, nez retroussé, and large
luminous dark eyes, she reminded me of one of those
French bichons, which look so earnest about nothing,
perched on a silken cushion in a lady's chamber, or lying
among the folds of her lawn apron. Nothing angular or
unsightly was revealed by the winding-sheet in which she
was swathed. A single row of pearls, or rivière of bril-
liants, adorned her white neck in the ball-room; an
almost invisible Venetian chain, on minor occasions. How
preferable to the harness-like ponderosity of modern car-
canets, allowing as little of the human frame divine of a
pretty woman to remain perceptible, as one sees of the
table-cloth at a country christening!
Coquette, — jilt, — flirt, - angel,- Lady Harriet ex-
celled in refinement of taste. Her house was charming ;
neither overloaded like my mother's with bijouterie and
gauds; nor affectedly simple, like the matter-of-factory of
Jack Harris. Fancy had some scope, but her wings were
clipped. She was allowed a flutter, not a fight. Intui-
tion seemed to have dictated my code of virtù on our first
acquaintance ; for the little widow's rooms were adorned
with a few chefs-d'æuvres by the first masters; a few
cabinets, in their places, not thrusting themselves impor-
tunately forward, like a young member in the House, or a
young miss in a ball-room ; and a sufficiency of rich fur-
niture, as studiously en suite as that of my poor mother
was mismatched and fanciful.
Poor Lady Ormington had, in fact, never recovered her
first glimpse of the chinoiseries of the boudoirs of Paris
and Trianon, in Marie Antoinette's time; when my
father, under the domination of her bright eyes, was
weak enough to pass his honeymoon on the banks of the
Seine. Snatched from the simplicity of a country parson-
age into a paradise of buhl and ormoulu, her ladyship’s
ideas received an ineffaceable impression, which produced
and re-produced itself in her tawdry domain in Hanover

Square. Apple-green and turquoise-blue, - lacquer and
Japan, - Chelsea and Sèvres, - ebony encrusted with
ivory or mother-of-pearl, — dainty bonbonnières of Dutch
enamel, - curious snuff-boxes, which, on the lid, displayed
the lady wife, and by a secret spring, the lady fair of the
Lauzuns and Richelieus of their day, abounded in her
brittle domain. Her existence was all Watteau,-- all
à vignette, - all Pompadour, - all powder puff, all musk,
all ambergris !- Time need have had gold-sand in his
glass, and an agate handle to his scythe, to deal with such
a life of trifling!
There was more character in the frivolity of her friend.
It was Greuze, rather than Watteau - it was Voltaire,
not Parny. I am speaking, bien entendu, of Lady Har-
riet as I saw her, face to face, not as I recollect her, re-
miniscence to reminiscence. To the Cecil Danby of
twenty-and-a-half, she was irresistible, - an epitome of all
that was pleasant (but wrong) in woman.
I was never sure of her. Compared with her, a weather-
cock was a fixture and a cameleon permanent. —A bevy
of those
gay creatures of the elements
That in the colours of the rainbow live;
a swarm of humming-birds,-- a French brocade, - a
Neapolitan brigand, - an edition of Horace Walpole,
do not combine a greater variety of hues and fantasticalities.
After uttering a series of brilliant repartees and biting
truths, that would have made the fortune of Conversation
Sharpe, or a witty parody like Canning's Pocket-book, she
was indignant if one presumed to consider her anything
but a fool; yet, after behaving like one for four-and-twenty
hours, (by angling for gudgeons, such as my cousin Lord
Squeamy or Sir Moulton Drewe, and flinging them back,
when caught, into the waters,) she would not suffer me
to presume one half-quarter of an inch upon her folly.
On the slightest act of forwardness, Lady Harriet made
me draw in my horns and sulk back into my shell ; like
any other wretched snail, who, presuming to trail itself
upon a rose, gets a thorn in its side for its pains.
It was like poetry after prose, - it was like grace after

meat, — it was like a ballet with Angiolini after an opera
without Catalani, — when, at the close of my official day,
I was admitted into the charming drawing-rooms in
Grosvenor Place ; confronting the elms of Buckingham
gardens, and opening into a gay conservatory fresh with a
profusion of the sweetest flowers.
Pimlico was then a remote suburb of London, losing
itself in gravel-pits and fields covered with scrubby herb-
age, vainly endeavouring to look green. Lady Harriet
preferred the situation, as the thing in town that most
resembled the country ; a place where the houses affected
rurality, with laburnum bushes, and other odd conceits,
trained over their frontage. I remember that, in my short
cut across the Park, along the Birdcage-walk to Bucking-
ham-gate, I always felt as though I were living in the
reign of Queen Anne, and as if Lady Harriet were living
at the Antipodes. On the days I paid my court to her,
there was no getting near St. James's Street; for Down-
ing Street, Grosvenor Place, and the, Clubs, formed the
extremities of a triangle.
The lovely tyrant was never visible till four o'clock ;
but rising at noon (l'aurore des jolies femmes), how did
she employ the interim ? - In the circle I usually found
assembled round her, consisting of about a dozen of the
élite of the day, there was no one to excite my jealousy :
the men were chiefly old roués, - men of forty, - men
who, in the eyes of twenty-and-a-half, possessed about the
attraction that a venerable classic, though printed by
Aldus and bound by Du Seuil possesses in those of a
schoolboy, compared with some new romance by M. G.
Lewis, in gaudy accoutrements of modern calf. Lady
Harriet might as well have selected, as an object of
jealousy, one of the wrinkled and painted cats abounding
in her loo-playing coterie, as I one of the ci-devant jeunes
gens, contemporaries of Sir Lionel Dashwood, who were
the Celadons of the bergerie in Grosvenor Place. Like
some boy-navigator, who, with
Youth at the prow and Pleasure at the helm,
neglects the lead, I was close upon the Goodwin Sands,
and fancied myself in fifty fathom water.

But how, then, did she fill up the hours when I was
idling through the business of the state in Downing Street?
- How was it with her from noon till four o'clock ? - I
had seen in my cockadehood Lady Ormington devote
half-a-dozen consecutive hours to the toilet, — painting,
patching, frizzing, -fastidious in the turn of a feather,
irresolute in the disposal of a repentir (I allude, of course,
to the curl of that name). But those were the days of
elaboracy, when the mere act of lacing was the affair of
an hour ; whereas Lady Harriet was one of the least
dressy of the present school of dishabille. Morning,
noon, or night, - I lie, afternoon or night being the only
epochs at which I saw her, she was invariably attired in
a muslin dress of exquisite whiteness and fineness ; having
her hair dressed in the simplest fashion, without trinkets
or ribbons to set off her face or figure. - Her simplicity
amounted almost to the puritanical.
It was clearly, therefore, not her “ toilet's fragrant task”
which caused her door to be denied ; though, at the happy
hour appointed for her manifestation to eyes profane, when
I was admitted into her presence, she had just the bright
enjoué look of a person who has been spending her time to
her heart's content ;– eyes beaming with intelligence, -
lips vivid with quickened circulation, - cheeks brightened
by the consciousness of beauty. Dull or cunning indeed
must be the woman's countenance, that does not betray to
a jealous man whether she has been too well amused
during his absence ! -
I had no opportunity of resolving my doubts. Chance
had favoured me with a tête-à-tête at our first interview;
but from that period I never saw her alone. We met in
the throng of the world, or at her own house ; but I could
never manage to arrive there till between four and five,
when her rooms were crowded. Nay, once, when by dint
of shirking my officialities and crossing the park at the
pace of pedestrian Barclay, I managed to arrive in Gros-
venor Place as the clock was striking four, I found myself
distanced by a certain Colonel Morley, a fellow in the
Guards, ugly as the devil, and, like that great potentate,
extremely well-mannered and prepossessing.

I do not mean that Morley was prepossessing to me.
There was something in his shrewd glance that cut me to
the soul. The superiority affected by Jack Harris roused
my indignation ; but the unaffected contempt of the
guardsman depressed me to the earth. So sure as I entered
Lady Harriet's presence with something witty or agreeable
in petto, the calm, investigating eye of Morley threw a
fatal damp over my spirits. My squibs were damaged,
and would not go off; my fireworks exploded in my own
face; and, when floundering in the midst of an entertain-
ing anecdote which his malice marred in the telling, he
used quietly to ask me, what next? — had I not forgotten
something? - was that all ? - How could I do otherwise
than detest such a man ! -He was my evil genius, -- and
an evil genius I was sure to meet at Philippi.
One morning, when several of the habitués of the house
had taken leave of Lady Harriet on the threshold of her
little conservatory, at the ringing of the postman's bell,
the usual signal for her airing, - I managed to linger a
moment behind the rest, and was rewarded for the quiet
way in which I accomplished my little manœuvre, by the
gift of a branch of heliotrope.
“ A token of approbation and encouragement, Mr. Cecil
Danby !” said she, still continuing to examine her flowers
and occupy herself with their arrangement. “You have
made fair progress. You have almost mastered the most
difficult of London lessons, - to subside into a fraction of
the multitude, and satisfy yourself with being a mere link
in the chain of society. Those who pretend to more, will
never become even that. You have no right, at present,
to individualize. You must live and move, and have your
being, in the life, movement, and sensibility of the mass.”
" In one respect, I certainly feel with the mass !” cried
I, with warmth ; “in my adoration of —”.
"My carriage is at the door," interrupted Lady Harriet ;
“ and if you have no better acknowledgment to offer for
my graciousness than such platitudes —”.
“ Your graciousness ! —” I ejaculated, with an appro-
priate sigh of reproach.
“ Don't treat it too lightly,” she replied ; “for it is

more the result of my indulgence than of your merits.
You are doing pretty well. You have learned to dress
simply, to ride a quiet hack, and place yourself in the
background of the picture. But you have still worlds
of wisdom to acquire. You talk too much ; you laugh
too much.-Your teeth are good, and your spirits high ;
but this does not suffice as an excuse for being heard in
company, when others, with greater minds and smaller
voices, are compelled to silence by your chattering.“
Look at Colonel Morley.—”
“ Thank you, I had rather not. — He is better to listen
to than look at.-”.
“A case directly contrary to your own," was her
provoking retort upon my impertinence. “ You would
do well, however, to study and take pattern by the well-
bred insouciance with which he contents himself to
remain unnoticed, in order that a cleverish lad, who has
his way to make in the world, may have a fair field for
his début.”
Was this sufficiently insulting ? — But for the dimples

for the exquisite whiteness of the little hand that withdrew.
itself out of a verbena-bush to emphasize her harangue, I
think, I should,- I scarcely know what !-
“ Where is the flower I gave you ?” said Lady Harriet,
- discerning, perhaps, something of the vacillation of my
feelings in the expression of my face.
I replied by laying my hand, with an expressive gesture,
upon my heart.
“Be so good as to put it in your button-hole,” said she,
coolly. “Do you suppose I like you well enough to give
you a flower, which I do not intend you to make a show
of ?- I gave it as the French Emperor bestowed a déco-
ration. The Legion of Honour would cease to create
beroes, if worn en cachette."
On my arrival in town, an order from Lady Harriet
Vandeleur to make an exhibition of her cadeau, would
have flattered my vanity. I knew better now. I saw
that she had no fear of being compromised by me ; and
scarcely was I in the street, before I flung down the sprig

of heliotrope upon the pavement, trusting Lady Harriet
would note it lying there on her way to the carriage.
Nam cupidè conculcatur nimis antè metutum.
Young gentlemen of tender years, when in love, are
almost as susceptible about being laughed at, as very
elderly gentlemen labouring under the same distemper.
I was angry. I assured myself that I was not going to
be made a plaything by a coquette : -- that I would not
remain the butt of a Colonel Morley. — For a week, -
for a fortnight,- (ten days I believe in reality, but the
profound ennui to which I was a victim, made me fancy
it a fortnight,) — I abstained from the house ; secretly
flattering myself with a hope of receiving one of those
little three-cornered notes, scribbled à pattes de mouche,
which I had seen lying superscribed with other names,
on her ladyship’s table.
But I waited in vain.- No note,- not even a message !
- I contrived to make myself apparent twice a week to
the inmates of Lady Harriet's opera-box; and posted
myself resolutely at the opposite side of the room, when-
ever we met at assemblies. But this was not often. She
belonged to a set which rarely forfeited caste in the in-
discriminate mobs of large parties ; and to the small
ones, I was not yet sufficiently in fashion to obtain an
entrée.
I could bear it no longer. Lady Harriet's piquant
society was as essential to me as a pinch of macauba to a
snuff-taker. I found myself growing lethargic ; yawned
in the face of Lord Votefilch, while he was pointing out
to me, that I neglected to dot my i's, in a précis; and in
that of my mother, while informing me that Dr. Blane
had insinuated that poor Bibiche was suffering from a
liver complaint. Still smarting under these double repri-
mands, I rushed to Grosvenor Place.
or When did you come to town, Mr. Danby?” inquired
Lady Harriet, in a patronising tone, breaking off her
conversation with the young Marchioness of Devereux,
the prettiest of the brides of the season.
“ I have not left London,” said I, provoked at being

compelled to proclaim a fact of which I knew her to be
perfectly aware.
“I mistook, then, what Lady Ormington told me about
you. I am sure she said something about absence. I
dare say she spoke of your being absent and out of spirits,
and I mistook it for absent and out of town.”
« I must still plead not guilty,"— said 1,-“having
enjoyed excellent health and spirits; and not the less for
having ascertained by ocular demonstration, at the Opera
and elsewhere, that your Ladyship was enjoying the same
advantages.”
“ How very bad the Opera is getting !- Unless they
do something better for us before the close of the season,
I shall give up my box next year,” said Lady Harriet,
suddenly addressing her fair visitor.
“ People always say so — nothing better is done, -
yet they renew their engagement !-” replied the Mar-
chioness, smiling. “However bad the Opera may be, we
can better spare a better thing.”
“At the beginning and end of the season, when there
is nothing going on!” observed Lady Harriet ; “but just
now, one has as little time for it, as patience.”
I had no patience with her hypocrisy ; for never was
she known to miss an opera !- I went that night, and
planted myself, as usual, opposite her box, with the view
of bringing her, if not to shame, to remorse. As I ex-
pected, she was there ; as I did not expect, the pretty
Marchioness was her companion.
“ I thought you were l'ami de la maison of the pretty
widow ?” observed Jack Harris, accosting me familiarly,
as I directed my moody looks towards the box of Lady
Harriet ; which, being on the pit tier, allowed the curious
in fashionable movements to obtain a surmise of Colonel
Morley and Sir Moulton Drewe, occupying the back-
ground. “ How come you to be standing here, with your
eyes fixed on her like those of Romeo on Juliet's balcony,
while others, armed with love's light wings,' have over-
topped the barrier ? -'
“ Because I am fonder of the warbling of Catalani, than
of the gabbling of even the prettiest woman in the world.”

“ But the divertissement, my dear fellow !- the diver-
tissement is the providence des âmes tendres,” cried Jack
Harris. And as he spoke, I saw him glance at a new
waistcoat, in nature and origin evidently an improvement
on the last!
I would have given worlds, at that moment, to have
been in possession of a sprig of heliotrope, even in my but-
ton-hole.
Lady Harriet was right. Such a trophy was not with-
out its value, Still more would I have given for the pri-
vilege of intruding into her box, which I had forfeited by
my foolish irascibility. Three weeks before, I might
have laid Jack Harris low with envy, and shrivelled up his
gay waistcoat at a glance, by my familiar attitude in that
envied spot. But now, I dared no more confront the
scrutinising eye of Morley or the reprehensions of Lady
Harriet, than leap on the stage and take a part in the
ballet !-- I was inexpressibly vexed. For boys such as we
then were, half the agonies of life arise from petty rubs of
vanity. Self-consequence is our idol; an idol that imposes
a perpetual hair-shirt and never-ending flagellation upon
its votaries !
I saw that Lady Harriet was contemptuously regarding
us ; and not to afford her the triumph of fancying she im-
posed upon me, affected to talk and laugh familiarly with
the companion she had pointed out to my avoidance ; pass-
ing in review the beauties present, with all the imperti-
nence of a novice. When lo! while affecting to run my
eye along the several tiers, it rested suddenly upon a face,
half hidden by the curtain of one of the upper boxes,
which put a period to my mirth! “ Aut Erasmus, aut
diabolus.” It was either Emily's or an angel’s ; — beau-
tiful as ever, — so beautiful, that the surprise of seeing her
there, was quickly followed by still greater surprise, when
I reflected that I had allowed nearly a month to elapse
without recalling her to my recollection.
Freely as we had been discussing the women present,
(and Jack Harris belonged to the class of men superabound-
ing in London, who, without access to good society,
familiarize themselves at public places with the names and

persons of those between whom and them there is a great
gulph fixed, but concerning whom they assume the pri-
vilege of uttering the grossest scandals,) I recoiled from
exposing Emily to the blasphemies of his sacrilegious
tongue. Nay, when following the direction of my eye,
and noticing my sudden flush, he exclaimed, - but I
will not record what he exclaimed, further than that it
contained a fitting tribute to the loveliness of the fair
inconnue.
I forbore to hazard a syllable implying knowledge of her
name or person ; but I was now more eager than ever to
shake him off. Nay, my eagerness was dictated by a feel-
ing so much more genuine than the dread of exposing
myself to the quizzing of a Lady Harriet Vandeleur, that
I succeeded. I was intent upon a nearer survey of Emily's
box; for, if there with her father alone, Lord Ormington's
son had every pretext for intruding upon Lord Orming-
ton's man of business.
Having hurried up one staircase, accordingly, and
down another, in order to give the slip to Jack Harris,
who, in spite of his assumption of superiority, neglected no
opportunity of clinging in public to my arm, I made my
way to the upper tier of boxes ; pigeon-holes, to which I
had occasionally glanced upward from Fop's Alley, as a
boy looks upon a kite traversing the fields of air, and with
about as much idea of ever finding myself elevated to the
same altitude.
No sooner had the box-keeper complied with my re-
quest, and opened an empty box for me, than I ascertained
that old Hanmer was not on guard. Emily's chaperon
was an elderly woman, arrayed like herself in mourning of
the simplest fashion, and stationed behind her as if in stu-
dious concealment; perhaps to command a better view of
the stage, perhaps because too homely to warrant display
at the Opera. I had little leisure, however, for conjectures.
My attention was engrossed by the beauty of her com-
panion. I had thought her handsome as she stood, cold
and contemptuous, in the dull drawing-room in Southamp-
ton Buildings. But now, with the brilliant light of the
chandelier irradiating her fair face and tinging with gold

her chesnut ringlets, I was startled by her surpassing
loveliness.
For a month past, my eyes had rested upon nothing but
those withered complexions and hardened countenances of
fashionable life, which, when viewed in a mass, with their
paint and varnish of ton fresh upon the surface, excite
neither surprise nor disgust. But the aspect of this young,
bright, innocent-looking creature, so impressed me with
admiration of its freshness and purity, that there needed
no severer criticism upon the deficiencies of Lady Harriet
and her companions.
Unconscious that she was the object of peculiar atten-
tion, Emily's eyes were fixed upon the stage ; and her
smiling face seemed to reflect back all the brightness and
interest of the ballet of “ Anacréon, ou l'Amour fugitif,”
in which Deshayes and his wife were displaying their
matchless graces. She was a study for an artist; with
her white, gracile, swan-like throat, stretched forward, so
that the auburn ringlets hung tendril-like over the hand
supporting her cheek!
Without so much excuse for the liberty of a visit to her
box as to that of Lady Harriet, I found it impossible to
resist temptation. — No reminiscence of Jack Harris's
waistcoat, however, among my motives. My feelings were
for once genuine !
I could have found it in my heart to reward with a
sufficient kick, the insolent smile of the box-keeper, when,
pointing out the box, I desired him to open the door.
I saw, as plainly as though he had spoken, the vile sur-
mises passing in his mind concerning its inmates.
But that his key was already in the door, methinks I
should have rescinded my order. Another moment, how-
ever, and I had passed the Rubicon; and was blending
with my incoherent excuses the most courteous inquiries
after the health of Mr. Hanmer, whom had I met in
the street I should have found some difficulty in recog-
nising.
Emily's answers were as cold as succinct. There is a
favourite phrase of “ putting people in their place.” If
it was in my place she put me, it was a very humble one ; /

for after encountering her chilling glances, I could have
crept into a nut-shell.
I attempted the remarks that were probably made in
every other box that night, to every other woman present,
concerning the prodigious voice of Catalani, and the
victorious rashness of her genius. But Emily would not
be beguiled into more than monosyllables in reply. She
evidently considered me as much out of place in her
aërial den at the Opera, as in her horrible drawing-room
in Southampton Buildings; and after flinging a word or
two at my head, as if throwing a stone, turned suddenly
towards her venerable companion, to whom she had made
no movement to present me, and began to converse cheer-
fully with her in some unknown tongue. Ignorant as
most young men who have received a first-rate education,
I knew not exactly what. It might be Spanish, - it
might be Portuguese, - it might be Polish, Hungarian,
or Russ. All I knew was, that it was neither French
nor English, - German nor Italian ; and further, neither
Eton nor Oxford enabled me to determine.
In the mouth of the elder lady, it was a grave, sonorous
language ; in that of Emily, rich and flowing. Her
countenance brightened as she talked, till it became almost
as intelligent as before my arrival in the box. Even
though she deigned not to notice my presence, it was a
sufficient enjoyment to listen to her melodious intonation
and watch the “ liquid lustre melting in her eyes."
Rather from awkwardness than audacity, — rather
because I knew not how to retreat than because resolved
to stay in her despite, - I stood my ground; and upon a
sudden exclamation of delight, whereby she directed the
attention of her chaperon to what was passing on the
stage, I even deliberately took possession of the unoc-
cupied chair immediately opposite Emily, on pretext of
sudden interest in the performance. Perhaps I wished to
draw a little nearer to her,- perhaps I wanted to exhibit
myself to the roué world in the pit, in company with
the most beautiful woman in the house, - perhaps I was
even anxious to attract the attention of Lady Harriet
Vandeleur to my superior good fortune. At all events,

the movement afforded me an excuse for expressing to
Emily my regret that she should occupy so vile a box,
where seeing or hearing were out of the question.
“ Would you permit me," I added, in my most insinu-
ating tone, " to send you, some night, my mother's box,
which is on the ground tier, and commands an excellent
coup d'æil of the ballet ? —”
She gazed at me with a calmly inquiring eye ; but
uttered not a syllable.
“ Had Lord Ormington been aware,” said I, by way of
recalling to her mind the exact nature of the link con-
necting us with each other," that you were fond of the
Opera, I am convinced he would long ago have had the
honour of offering it to Mr. Hanmer.”
I was convinced of no such thing; for Lord Ormington
would just as soon have thought of interfering with my
mother's Opera-box, as she of disposing of his service
of plate. But I chose Hanmer's daughter to bear in
mind the courtesy due to the son of her father's favourite
client.
Again, after a slight bend of the head by way of
acknowledgment, did she turn towards the grave old
matron in black, with a thousand lively comments upon
what was going on, either in her own box or in the ballet.
With the vulgar susceptibility of ignorance, I was con-
vinced, at every fresh smile and ejaculation, that they were
talking of me! At length, I felt so thoroughly uncom-
fortable, that I hazarded no further attempt at softening
her rigour beyond a deferential bow, and hastily departed.
“ You were scarcely fair with me, Cis, in allowing me
to run on unchecked, while passing my opinion just now
on your lovely friend !” cried Jack Harris, whom I en-
countered in the lobby of the fifth tier ; and who, I saw
plainly, had ascended so much above his usual Opera alti-
tude, only that he might interrogate the box-keeper touch-
ing the two mysterious ladies. “Another time, my dear
fellow, spare my feelings and your own, by saying, 'I
can't be explicit, but I won't be unfriendly. Do not
persist in your inquiries.'”
“ I should have been sorry to excite your curiosity by

any prohibition half so mysterious !” replied I, assuming
the tone of coolness with which he so often martyrized
me. « Nor was I aware that it was essential you should
be warned, to a day and a minute, whenever I had occasion
to form an agreeable acquaintance.”
Having uttered these oracular words, I left him, looking
vexed and malicious; and, in the recklessness caused by
the triumph of the moment, made my way straight to the
box of Lady Harriet; having noticed, from the opposite post,
that Drewe and Morley had quitted her, as even the most
devoted men are apt to quit the most charming of women,
when the back of their box does not command a view of
the dancing
Why was it that both the Marchioness and her friend
received me so affably? Why was it that, throughout the
remainder of the night, their conversation with me was
so unintermittingly kept up, that it would have been
difficult to find a moment for leaving them ? —Had my
recent emotion imparted unusual expression to features not
altogether deficient in merit?-Had the ambition of con-
quering in the fifth tier, endowed me with the power of
conquest in the first? - Had they noticed me leaning
familiarly over the box of that lovely creature ?-or were
they, after all, simply intent upon avenging the base deser-
tion of their recreant kpights by a manifest flirtation ?-
The latter supposition presented itself in time to prevent
my making a fool of myself. The dread of being accepted
as a pis aller, saved me. The torch might burn and
sparkle as brightly as it listed, but they should see that
Cecil Danby was not the silly moth to singe his wings. I
made myself irresistible. The jargon of London life,
which at first appeared so difficult of acquirement, is as
easy as lying, when studied by an enlightened mind.
Early education had taught me the rudiments. I had
stood in the stocks of fashion in my infancy; and my toes
being properly turned out, dancing came by intuition. I
was already a tolerable trifler; could recite a piquant anec-
dote without losing the point, broder upon a slender hint of
scandal, and twist a bon mot so artfully, that my fair audi-
tresses had a right to suppose it hazarded by themselves.

To the Marchioness, I chattered ; with Lady Harriet, I
listened ; and consequently, was successful with both. It
has been told of a late nobleman, equally distinguished by
his abilities and absence of mind, that, having talked to
himself in his travelling-carriage the whole way from
Brighton to London, he ended at Hyde Park Corner, by
inviting himself to dinner, as the pleasantest companion
he had ever travelled with. Lady Harriet evidently thought
as much of me; because what passed for dialogue between
us, was as much a monopolylogue as those of Mathews.
Never had I seen her so gracious!-- Not a sarcasm,
not a reproof! Kind, encouraging, it needed all the
beauty of the expressive face on which, for an hour past,
I had been gazing, to convince me that the charming little
widow from whose mouth dropped pearls and diamonds,
and in whose large eyes sparkled shrewdness and wit,
was three-and-thirty years of age, a hardened fraction of
that adamantine temple of worldliness, called the beau
monde !

liancy ought to have dazzled, — such affability ought to
have overwhelmed me!- Far from it ! — The chaste
moonlight imparts no charm to the glaring sunshine ;
though glaring sunshine disposes us for the refreshing
softness of the tranquil moon. For the first time, I dis-
cerned effort in Lady Harriet's wit, and restlessness in her
vanity. But, as my admiration declined, my embarrass-
ment vanished. My tongue was loosed. I became natural
in her presence ; that is, natural as the clipped hedges and
formal parterres of a Dutch garden. My fair friends
were content, however, with the gaudy blossoms tendered
by my gallantry. Both of them smiled upon me “de-
lightfully with all their might;" and accordingly at the
most earnest moment of the conversation, I started up,
as if recollecting an engagement, made a profound bow,
and,

more than that the man who has found refuge in her
comfortable Opera-box, and amused himself with her
lively chat, should take his precipitate departure five
minutes before the conclusion of the ballet ; – a deliberate
avowal that he'disdains the honour (that is, that he chooses
to shirk the bore) of escorting her to her carriage. But
to leave her alone in her glory,to leave her, when the
kindnesses lavished upon you have been the means of
keeping more assiduous beaux from the field, is an
“ ungrateful injury,” past all forgiveness !
Morley, I knew, was off to White's. Morley was the
strongest whist-man of his day ; one of those whom one
knows as well where to find, at a certain hour of the night
throughout the season, as the premier during the session of
parliament. Squeamy and Drewe were lounging, as usual,
in the pit directly under Lady Harriet's box. I made it
my business to pin them there firmly by the button,-
too happy in being button-held by me, usually so super-
cilious in my acceptance of their acquaintance, so that
she could have no hopes of us! No mistaking our united
intentions to convoy nothing but ourselves and our canes
out of the Opera House that night. Indeed, I had already
engaged my companions to sup with me at Watier's, —
a new club, the head quarters of the roués, of which our
three Insignificances were component parts.
My plan was to remain there, en évidence, till the last
moment; then just as the curtain was falling, rush up to
the · skiey regions of the fifth tier, to ascertain by what
fortunate cavalier Emily and her chaperon were escorted.
I did not foresee that the stairs would be crowded with
people hurrying down ; and that, as usual, where a single
person attempts to combat the mass, the mass would have
the best of it. The upper part of the house was half
empty before I reached the spot.
Everybody in the unlucky habit of frequenting the
London theatres, either in those days or these, must have
found their choler excited, on some occasion or other, by
the coarseness of the Rule-Britannia class of the com-
munity frequenting the galleries; and just as often, by the
indecorum of a class of men, who, if better born and bred,

61
are scarcely better mannered, — dandies of a secondary
order, whose gallantry consists in staring women out of
countenance, and whose heroism in knocking a man down!
On reaching the door of the box which so strongly
excited my interest, I found it besieged by a group of
Lovelaces of this description ; and, unless I am much
mistaken, my eye caught a glimpse of Jack Harris himself,
hurrying off on my approach, as if ashamed of being seen
in such company. But the lights were all but extin-
guished, and I was unable positively to determine. Even
the box-keepers were gone; and but that the doors of the
adjoining boxes stood open, while that of Miss Hanmer's
remained closed, I should have concluded that I was too
late, and that Emily had taken her departure.
Something in the triumphant air of the scamps stationed
in the vicinity, convinced me they were lying in ambush
for her exit, to molest her with insult. But how to obtain
admittance in the boxkeeper's absence, with a tender of
my services ? — I knocked at the door of the box ; - no
answer!-At length, it occurred to me to enter the one
adjoining, and to lean over for a parley. Anxiety on her
account imparted courage for so bold an intrusion. I was
boiling with rage. I felt convinced that she was held
prisoner by those blackguards. It was in perfect good
faith, it was with the truest and best intentions, that I
pushed my way into the next box, drew aside the inter-
vening curtain, and addressed her.
For a moment, I suspect, Emily mistook me for an
auxiliary of her persecutors; for her first movement, on
hearing herself spoken to, was to retreat into a corner
behind her companion. I raised my voice, however, to
re-assure her.
“ I fear you have no one to see you to your carriage !
-” said I. " Will you do me the favour to accept my
arm ?
”
A few hurried words addressed to her companion, in
which I could detect, though altered by a foreign accent,
the names of Lord Ormington and Mr. Hanmer, seemed
intended to explain the connection between us. But the
agitated tone in which they were uttered, served to con-

vince me that I had not mistaken their situation ; that
they were alone, — unprotected, — terrified. - Emily ad-
vanced to the front of the box, to explain that they
accepted my offer with gratitude; and the sight of her
blanched cheeks and tremulous lips excited so much emo-
tion in my breast, that I forgot to congratulate myself
on having vanquished her scruples or humbled her pride.
“I fear, -- I greatly fear, ” cried I, “ that you have
experienced some annoyance ? - If you would only point
out to me, as we go down, the individual by whom —”
She stopped me. “ If I profit by your kindness,” said
she," it is only on condition that you take no notice of
anything that has occurred, or may occur, concerning us.
Nothing would annoy me so much as to become the object
of a dispute."
“ Do me the favour then to admit me into your box
till you are sufficiently composed for a sortie,” said I,
“ in order that it may be seen you have an authorized
protector.
No need of the precaution. On making my way round,
the coast was clear. I had consequently no difficulty in
persuading Miss Hanmer to hasten from the spot, where
only a glimmering light remained to render our situation
more embarrassing.
“ The gentleman who accompanied us hither, the bus-
band of Madame d'Acunha,” said Emily, in a low voice,
(as we hurried down stairs together, closely followed by
the old lady, whom she seemed to introduce by the latter
name,) “ must have met with some accident, which pre-
vented his rejoining us. He usually leaves us during the
ballet, to obtain a better place in the pit; but has never
before failed to be in time for escorting us out.”
“And you have consequently been exposed to annoy-
ance! I am convinced of it, - it is useless to deny it!
_” cried I, with swelling bosom, when, on reaching the
lobbies adjoining the crush-room, now nearly empty, I
perceived the four vulgar brutes already noticed, leaning
against the wall, as if to wait our passing. They were
indulging in noisy mirth. It was the epoch of “coaching;"
and with the abuse of propriety distinguishing the genuine

Bond-street lounger, these individuals were dressed in the
bang-up style, which the Barouche Club had brought into
fashion,-, their dialecť being the newly-discovered Eu-
ropean tongue, called slang. — I saw at a glance that I,
Cecil Danby, should irremediably soil my fingers by
contact with such gentry; and with the most valiant
intentions, was grateful to Emily's moderation, when she
persisted in assuring me I was mistaken. Instead of
casting a triumphant glance upon the baffled enemy, she
quietly, but firmly, impelled me in a contrary direction
toward the chair door.
I inquired if it was there her carriage was waiting ? -
“ I have no carriage,” she replied, without the slightest
embarrassment. “ Perhaps you will have the goodness to
call a hackney-coach for us, as Monsieur d'Acunha is not
here."
I was horrified !-- not at the idea of calling a hackney-
coach ; not even at the degradation awaiting the beautiful
and queenly creature leaning on my arm ; but at the
prospect of leaving her alone, while I proceeded along
those horrible avenues of Shepherd's-market, which the
awkward issues of the Opera House at that period rendered
inevitable. Candour was my only alternative. “I dare
not leave you," said I. « Accompany me out, and a link-
boy will procure us a coach.”
At the chair door stood Jack Harris, in company with
two other Christchurch-men, — their hands in their
pockets, and insolence in their eyes ! -
« Please to want a coach, sir ? -” cried half a dozen
link-boys, surrounding us, as we emerged into the dirty
passage.
“ Please to want a coach, sir ? -" mimicked the voices
of half a dozen other frequenters of the detestable spot,
on perceiving that we were not attended by a servant, and
that my companions were not in what is termed full-dress.
Heaven knows I cared nothing about “ pleasing to want
a coach.” I flatter myself my worldly position justifies
my being seen in such a vehicle, whenever or wherever it
suits my convenience ; and, saving for their cursed noise,
the chorus of link-boys would have little moved my spleen,

.
But that Emily should be exposed under such circum-
stances to the sneers of Jack Harris and his companions,
wounded me to the quick! - The whole gang was now
united, and followed us leisurely to the spot where, after
the departure of the sedan chairs, a few miserable king's
coaches, looking as if they wanted only a touch to tumble
to pieces, were permitted to jolt their way to the pave-
ment. :
One of these, summoned by the link.man's twang, was
already drawn up and awaiting us ; the iron steps rattling,
and the dirty straw displayed by the light of half a dozen
links, the proprietors of which stood requesting the ladies
to take their time, in a tone that sounded wonderfully like
a threat. A beastly fellow of a coachman, whose rusty
clothes seemed to have as much difficulty in adhering to
him as the component parts of his coach and horses to
each other, was pushing them back, with a hand that held
a wisp of hay, while the other kept open the creaking door.
What an equipage for Emily ! - As it stared me in
the face, I seemed to feel that Jack Harris and his rampant
crew were staring at it from behind me!- I could hear
their repressed laughter.-I could imagine all that was
passing in their minds !-
Do me not the injustice, kind reader, to suppose that it
was for the Honourable Cecil Danby the flush mounted
to my cheek. I know not how it might be with me now,
after the demoralization of an ill-spent life. But I was
then only twenty and seven months. I had still a heart,
- ay, and as full of magnanimity as the leading article of
a newspaper.
“ You must allow me to accompany you home. I do
not consider you safe !” said I, whispering through the
chesnut curls of Emily. “Do me justice. I have no
presumptuous views in pressing my services upon you.
But you are watched by those who would scruple nothing
in pursuing their aggressions. If you choose it, I will
take my place with the coachman ; but you shall not pro-
ceed so far as Southampton Buildings unattended.”
Emily answered not a word. I could make nothing of
her silence, save that it gave consent. Fool that I was,

65
not to suspect the truth, — that it proceeded from her
tears!
· The moment I had placed her and the old lady in the
coach, I jumped in after them; and, having flung the
link-boys their reward, whispered the address to the surly
old brute who was slamming the door. At that moment,
the glare of half-a-dozen links, assembled to grace our
departure, fell upon the faces of the facetious group, of
which Jack Harris formed a part ; displaying, under
varied forms of expression, amazement, envy, and derision!
I did not dwell upon their insolence, further than
by grinding between my teeth certain imprecations, pur-
porting to take a more developed shape hereafter; for,
though perplexed by the darkness, and distracted by the
jarring and jangling of the vehicle, the sobs of Emily were
audible from the shoulder of her companion, into whose
arms she had thrown herself.
I had just self-command to forbear offering consolations
which would have aggravated her uneasiness. My busi-
ness there was to be a silent and unobtrusive guardian.
The old lady, or, since such was her name, Madame
d'Acunha,— was well satisfied to engross the conversation,
by a torrent of words, of which the purport was sufficiently
revealed by the successive tones of rage, fear, and resent-
ment, varying her ejaculations. Unless the truant, the de-
linquent, the absent-without-leave Monsieur d’Acunha,
were far gone in apoplexy or some other lethargic seizure,
I would not have been in his skin at their next meeting !
She probably threatened quite as loudly the aggressors who
had presumed on their unprotected situation ; but of this,
as no proper name served as index to her invectives, I was
unable to judge.
All my thoughts, moreover, were engrossed by the grief
of Emily. I fancied, (what is not one able to fancy at
twenty-and-a-half !) that I could detect in her weeping, as
clearly as in Madame d'Acunha's abuse, inflexions of
wounded pride, of suffering delicacy. I was even in
hopes that my turn might come, and tears of peniten
gratitude signalize her recognition of my modest merit.
But her sobs subsided to sighs, and her sighs to silence,

without a sound having escaped her lips indicative of con-
sciousness of my presence!
I could not stand this long. " You are better now, I
trust ? ” said I, still preserving appropriate calmness of
manner and attitude. Had I and old Madame d'Acunha
been tête-à-tête in the coach, I could not have maintained
a more decorous perpendicularity.
" As much better as I can be with the consciousness of
having been troublesome to everybody, and a burthen to
myself,” she replied, with much emotion. ~ Mr. Han-
mer warned me that I was imprudent in yielding to my
passionate love of music so far as to venture to the Opera,
attended only by those whose ignorance of the English
language might expose us to difficulties. But habit
renders bold. I have now so repeatedly occupied the
same box without attracting notice or annoyance, that I
ceased even to apprehend it.”
« But since your father was aware of the danger," I
observed, “why not himself attend you to the theatre ? -"
“ You have twice given me reason to suppose that you
regard me as the daughter of Mr. Hanmer," was her mild
reply. “Your kindness entitles you to explanations which,
as a stranger, I feared could not be very interesting. I am
his ward. — I have been but a few months in England. -
I am an inmate of his house. --- My name is Emily
Barnet."
There was something in the explicit frankness of her
explanation, which reminded me of Franklin and his boot-
jack.
“ I trust,” said I, “ you will not the less permit me to
consider myself (connected, as I am, by peculiar ties with
Mr. Hanmer,) privileged to officiate as your protector
whenever or wheresoever my aid may be wanting.”
or You have been most kind, and I am deeply sensible
of the obligation,” replied Emily, with some sensibility ;
" but you must forgive me for assuring you that any
further acquaintance between us would be unacceptable to
my guardian.”
This was throwing down the glove of defiance some-
what cavalierly; but I had no leisure to remonstraté.

Emily's tears had prolonged themselves so unreasonably,
that we were approaching Southampton Buildings. I per-
ceived, moreover, that we were not only near the term
of our journey, but dodged by a hackney-coach, evidently
intent upon keeping up with us. Though careful not to
breathe a hint of my suspicions, I congratulated myself
silently on my foresight in not having allowed thein to
return home alone. At Mr. Hanmer's door, I was pre-
paring to jump out, when Emily delayed me with an
urgent request that, after depositing her, I would proceed
with Madame d'Acunha, to her residence in Burton
Crescent.
“ Were she to alight here, to spare you this trouble,”
said Emily, “ Mr. Hanmer would become aware that
something unusual had occurred, and experience uneasi.
ness for the future. Do me the favour, therefore, to take
care of my friend home. She speaks no English, or would
add her acknowledgments to my own.”
So saying, she sprang out of the coach, the steps of
which had been let down during her address. I had not
even found time to offer her my hand ; and Pepper-and-
Salt, with a tallow-candle in his hand, was now on guard
over us! All that remained was to get rid of the old lady
with as much celerity as I had been got rid of by the
young one.
But, while giving my attention to Emily's parting re-
quest, the artful dodger of a hackney-coach had escaped
me ! - No vestige of it in any direction !- Having
tracked Miss Barnet into the house, its mission was ac-
complished ; for I don't suppose it signified much to
Jack Harris at what number in Burton Crescent might
reside the worshipful helpmate of the missing Monsieur
d'Acunha.
“ A pretty finale to my evening's amusements, upon
my soul !” – cried I, on finding myself jogging along the
then gloomy and half-finished streets adjoining Burton
Crescent. “I - Cis Danby,—to be benighted in the
wilds of Bloomsbury! — And for what? – To play the
squire to an old cat in a rusty bom bazine gown, with a
complexion only half a degree less dingy!”

The mansion in which Madame d'Acunha had requested
to be deposited, appeared sufficiently respectable to war-
rant better habiliments and a more creditable equipage ;
and now that I was alone in the coach, I could perceive,
powerful even beyond its fustiness, the searching and
delicious fragrance of vanille, which appears to form the
natural atmosphere of the women of Portugal.
It was not, however, till fairly ensconced in the easy
chair of my own room in Hanover Square, (which, by
the way, did not by any means correspond with Jack
Harris's predictions,) that I became fully sensible of the
strangeness of my fortune in the events of the evening.
Petted by Lady Harriet, — smiled upon by the Mar-
chioness, - thanked — gratefully and affectionately thanked,
by Emily !-- It was surely enough to turn a stronger head
than the one which had never sat straight upon its shoulders,
since the demoralizing epoch of its first cockade !-

It is time, methinks, that I'afford some slight idea of the
temple consecrated by my mother's devotion and my own
to the worship of that memorable individual, the Honour-
able Cecil Danby; for though it was only the same double
room on the third floor of the house in Hanover Square,
occupied by my nursery in my cockadehood, and by John
and myself, conjointly, in our school-days, it had now
assumed a character of higher interest for posterity.
Lady Ormington, like the majority of silly women, had
a passion for furnishing. Before the high-pressure-edu-
cation-movement came into play, writing ill-spelt letters,
and running up upholsterers' bills, were among the least

mischievous avocations of those whose game was loo, and
whose virtue, the charity that covereth a multitude of
sins.
My rooms, gentle reader! (or, on this occasion more
especially, reader fair !) my rooms, as I found them on
arriving for my first Oxford vacation, were hung with a
highly glazed white paper, matched with highly glazed
white furniture; the whole being vivified by a gay pat-
tern of blue convolvulus. Even the carpet exhibited, on
its pale grey ground, the same design, and the Wor-
cester china was what George Robins would call en suite.
Nothing could be more summer-like and cheering. The
furniture was of the darkest rose-wood; the shower-bath
white japan. But the triumph of the whole was the
dressing-table, on whose spotless marble slab stood the
crystal and gold belongings of the dressing-box, manu-
factured for me by Gray, under the immediate directions
of Lady Ormington.
The most refined coxcombry breathed in the arrange-
ments of my sanctuary. Something, however, of the old
bachelor was perceptible in the exactness of its distribution.
The boot-jack knew its appointed place; and the nail-
nippers would not have been at their ease unless laid side
by side with the razor-strop. Unluckily, the small groom,
(for as yet tigers were not ~ 6 we had not got the name,

younger sonhood, supplied the place of valet, did not
always understand this as well as the boot jack and nail-
nippers ; and for the first three weeks Tim flourished in
my service, seldom less than fifty threats of annihilation
per diem were extorted by his negligence. I might pos-
sibly have put one of them into execution, had I contem-
plated any likelihood of replacing the little sinner within
many inches of his meritorious exiguity.
Small grooms were just “come in,” — as they say of
green peas, strawberries, and fashions. Women have in all
ages been addicted to trifles of this description, such as
pages, dwarfs, and marmosets. But it remained for our
own times to attach to the six feet two of fully developed
manhood, three feet or less, by way of henchman to its

valour. I have heard of brats, born in a mews and in a
stable bred, deliberately stunted, like puppies, and by the
same spirituous potations, in order to accomplish them for
a tigerhood.
Tim,—“ my boy,” as Falstaff used to call his page, and
as we then all called our tigers,— had won my affections
by the pluck with which I saw him bear a severe fall from
one of Lady Ormington's horses, to the back of which,
poor atom ! he had been lifted by his father, her ladyship's
Irish coachman. I promoted him on the spot to tops and
buckskins; and a few days afterwards, not an eye in the
ring but was bent with envy and admiration upon the natty
little puppet who made so knowing a figure upon my bay
mare. I was offered any money for Tim by Sir Moulton
Drewe. But as Lady Harriet Vandeleur had inquired
“ where I could possibly have picked up that love of a
groom ! —” I would not part with him “for any money.”—
Tim soon proved himself invaluable,- an enormous
addition to my personal consequence: I stood higher in
the world by three feet.— I was one of the few who, by
taking thought, have added a cubit to their stature.
“ Yon's a varmint little chap o' yourn, sir,” said Fet-
lock the dealer, to me, one day, as I was lounging in his
yard with Sir Moulton Drewe. Come o' the roight sort,
I reckon ;-a truss o' the ould load,-a foal o' the true
dam.—I s'pose he'll get to Newmarket in time.—As good
a whip, sir,-(Connaught Bill, the lad's father, I mean !)
- as ever turned a family coach out of a yard; ay! and
as showy with the ribbons in hand and his levée wig on,
as ever sat a ’ammercloth, is Connaught Bill !-Many's the
judge 'ould give his heyes for sich a presence as his'n. But
I must say, sir, for her ladyship Lady Ormington, your
mamma, sir, that her ladyship knows a good thing when
she's got it! I sold my lady them greys of hern, sir ;
and her ladyship wrote me out a cheque for the money on
Drummond, sir, like a gemman !-A long price in them
times, sir, three hundred guineas. But I never heard no
complaints; and when her la’ship was wanting summut
neat for you, sir, last season, she sends to me, and, “ Mr.
Fetlock, sir -,' says her la’ship, 'you'll please to look out

a good-looking 'ack for my son,' says she.—Don't stand
to a guinea or two for price,' says her la’ship,—'cause the
paying is my affair ; and I don't look to a trifle, so as he
gets summut as is not showy, but well-bred and the roight
thing,' says she.—And, dang it! that showed the roight
thing, I take it, Mr. Danby, sir. Your vulgar chaps, of
nobody knows who, as comes 'ere to my yard, with the tin
ringing in their pockets, the first thing they sings out for
_ Fetlock,' says they, ‘haven't 'ee got summut showy—
summut as 'll cut a splash in the Park ?'-Lor' bless 'ee, sir,
- her la’ship, Lady Ormington, be too much of a lady to
wish a son of her'n to be cutting splashes in the Park !~
and I'm main glad, I assure you, sir, to see that chap o'
Connaught Bill's in such good training, I be.”
I have, I trust, brought my lares and penates suffi-
ciently before my readers, to enable them to conjecture my
agrémens personnels, when rousing myself at the matin
summons of Tim, and stretching my manly limbs in my
airy French bed. On the morning after the Opera affair,
I slept as soundly as if the bunches of bright blue convol-
vulus over my head were so many poppies. I was even
moved to say something almost as uncivil as Solomon said
in his haste, concerning Downing Street and its regu-
lations, when Tim drew aside my curtains in the dead of
morning.
“ Plase yer honour, tain't Downing Strate at all at
all!” — cried the little fellow, laying a triangular billet on
my pillow. “Only Lady Hawyet's jontleman be a waiting
for an answer, sir.”
“ Lady Harriet?” – Yes — the three-cornered messenger
of bliss was come at last ! - Piqued, by heavens !- I
seemed to see an embroidered waistcoat in the perspective,
as I tore open the little treasure with all the eagerness of a
child demolishing a flower,
Reader!-(entre nous,) dost thou know the little, con-
scious, fluttering demi-semi tone of kindness in which a
woman addresses the man who is neither acquaintance,
friend, nor lover, but something more than the one,
less than the other, and whom she fears perhaps as much
as she wishes to convert into the third ?-Art thou ac-

quainted with the letter that neither “dears” nor “my
dears” thee? — that calls thee neither Sir,- nor Mr. So
and So ;—neither Henry, Harry, nor Hal;— but bursting
at once into a strain of familiarity, as into a challenge, in
medias res, gives thee to understand that the sweet crea-
ture writes as she would speak; and would fain have
thee read in the same candid and eager spirit thou hadst
listened ? —
A very great man committed himself by putting it into
print that he knew no greater happiness than to sit by the
fire and read good novels! I could have surprised him
with a brighter notion : - to lie in an airy French bed,
showered over with blue convolvulus, and read such billets
as I describe ; — such billets, in short, as the following
from Lady Harriet Vandeleur. Am I (Heaven and
Watier's forgive my breach of trust!) – am I justified in
making it public ? -
“ Be pleased to come and dine with us to day at Rich-
mond. If you are at my door at four, Lady Devereux
will give you a place in her barouche. We go early, that
we may do a little rural before dinner; though I scarcely
know whether the lilacs and laburnums are sufficiently in
bloom to satisfy the demands of nightingales or fine
ladies. By the way, what do you mean by defying my pro.
hibitions, and being seen with that dreadful Mr. Harris
Harrison — you know whom I mean -- the Oxford man,
who wears flashy waistcoats, and takes off his gloves to
exhibit his rings ? - I have another quarrel with you of
the same kind. But we will fight it out at Richmond.
Sans adieu !”
The other quarrel, my exulting heart assured me,
regarded Emily ! Lady Harriet had heard of my escorting
a nameless beauty, a lady of equivocal appearance, publicly
at the Opera ; - nay, had seen me in her box. — Ex-
quisite triumph!- I was to be called to order by a
reprimand ! —
« Plase your honour, Lady Hawyet's jontleman 'ould
be glad to know what answer for my lady ? ” demanded
Tim, advancing towards the bedside, as he saw me about
to commence a third reperusal of the billet. “ Lady
Hawyet's jontleman be werry partic'lar about waiting.”

“I will send an answer presently,” said I, already
resolved that the “presently ” should extend far into the
morning; and the answer, when received, reduce the
little beauty to despair. Ten Lady Harriets and twenty
pretty marchionesses would not have tempted me to
Richmond. —
Just as her ladysbip's invitation determined me to absent
myself, did Emily's prohibition excite me to return to
Southampton Buildings.
A visit of ceremony -- of inquiry — was indispensable. —
No need to alarm old Hanmer with allusions to what had
passed. For a man of any skill, nothing so easy as to
make old Six-and-eightpence the instrument of conveying
my message to his ward, without consciousness of his
mission. Between the claims of office-hours, therefore,
and the remoteness of my Mecca in Bloomsbury, Lady
Devereux's barouche (even had I been inclined for it) was
out of the question.
I repeated this to myself fifty times while I was
dressing. Always mistrust your own motives when you
repeat à thing to yourself fifty times. Nothing more
suspicious than to find yourself laying down the law to
yourself with such damnable iteration ;- more particularly
those, who, like myself, have no time to lose in argument ;-
for time and tide, public offices and the green curtain, wait
for no man.
I was forced to be in Downing Street every day, by ten
of the clock. Such was the compact between Votefilch
and Lord Ormington, such the compact between Lord Or-
mington and myself ; the balance of the scales resting on
the fulcrum of my strict obedience, being beggary, or four
hundred and seventy-five pounds a-year! I was past the
age for idylls and empty pockets. I had learned to talk
with Voltaire of “le superflu, chose si necessaire !”—and
consequently thanked my mother sincerely for the gift of
an excellent Breguet repeater ; owing to which, and my
prudence, I was seldom many minutes behind my time.
Lord Ormington's voice, however insignificant in the
House to which he devoted it, was in his own as the fiat
of the gods! Even routine acquires an air of forcibility,

if powerfully persevered in. The regularity of his hours
and habits, and the obstinacy of his reserve, endowed him
as he advanced in life with the mysterious importance con.
ceded to the ebb and flow of the tides. There is some-
thing portentous and awful in the periodical appearance
of heavenly bodies, or disappearance of mundane ones. I
swear that the nightly driving off of Lord Ormington's
carriage was beginning to inspire me with respect.
More than once, Lady Harriet had warned me against
irreverence towards his lordship ; and very much more
than once, had my mother checked me by an anxious look,
when I was hazarding against him the sort of gay persiflage,
which an old man is slow to perceive, but which, if he once
perceives, he rarely fails to visit with vengeance. She
seemed horribly afraid of my offending him ; and in process
of time, I began to participate in her deference.
My respect extended even to his colleagues. Branded
with the ignominious shame of cadet-ship, and conse-
quently doomed by the obsolete barbarisms of feudal law
to feed on husks in order that my elder brother might
luxuriate on the fatted calf, I was well pleased, since my
apprenticeship in public life was inevitable, to serve it
under such a master of his craft as Lord Votefilch. He
was a clever arbitrary man, a Napoleon on a Lilliputian
scale ; - great in centralization, - having an undeviating
system of official subordination, and keeping his youngsters
admirably drilled.
There was a good deal stirring then in the administration
of our foreign policy. “ There were giants on the earth
in those days.” Napoleon and Wellington were making
war, — Metternich and Nesselrode making peace ; and I
was making myself useful, by transcribing in cypher which
I did not understand, despatches which no one understood.
Yet, somehow or other, my amour propre was interested
in my vocation. I was the fly on the wheel. Whenever
second editions were trumpeted through the streets by the
newsmen's horns, I kept saying to myself, like that deluded
insect, What a devil of a dust we are kicking up! — After
having simply mended the pens for the Secretary who
mended the style of Lord Votefilch's protocols, I looked

down upon Sir Moulton Drewe and my cousin Squeamy
as poor useless creatures, unworthy the noble soil of the
land that pretends to rule the waves, while every year
it yields up a circumferential foot or two to their presump-
tuous encroachinent. -
Joking apart, Votefilch was a great man for the arduous
times he lived in. Planted between a double battery,
exposed in parliament to the broadsides of a powerful
opposition, and in office to the puzzlement arising from
the shifting policy of such of the powers of Europe as
were not already engulphed in the greatest despotism of
modern times, the cannonarchy of Napoleon, his lordship
stood firm as a Colossus, or as a donkey,
By his own weight made stedfast and immoveable.
His patience had the skin of a buffalo. His temper was
the sort of granite, on which you may hammer for hours
without eliciting a spark. It is difficult to rate too highly
this species of impassibility in a public man. In official
life, he whose shrinking susceptibility betrays his vulner-
able point, attracts such incessant showers of arrows, that
he has neither leisure nor self-possession for the accom-
plishment of his purposes.
Now the Right Honourable Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs had the highest esteem for the Right
Honourable Lord Ormington. Lord Ormington was one
of the heavy pieces of ordnance, invaluable to government
in certain emergencies. When vexatious questions were
pressed by the opposition, he was always ready to rise and
generalize with plausibilities, while the stunned party reco-
vered its senses, and gathered itself up for reply ;-a sort
of moral point d'orgue, giving breathing space to the solos.
-Nothing, in fact, but the importance of his services,
would have pleaded with Votefilch, to admit into his office
a young gentleman with hands so white and pretensions so
towering, as those of the Honourable Cecil Danby. For
he was essentially a practical man ;-an astronomer, not
an astrologer ;-one who regarded poetry as a mild species
of insanity; - quarrelled with the Woods and Forests,
because they would not mend the roads with the ruins of

Fotheringay Castle ; --- and could perceive no irony in
Hamlet's assignment of purpose to the ashes of “Imperial
Cæsar.” It seemed a relief to his mind, that emperors,
when turned to clay, could be turned to account.
Gods! how I ramble !-- Old fellows always do, from
the moment they are pinned down into their gouty chair.
-Reminiscence is as trackless as any other land of dreams;
and the mind floats on, like the wind, whithersoever it
listeth.
At five o'clock, on the day from which I started into
these digressions, gentle reader, little Tim held my horse
in Southampton Buildings while I left my card for old
Hanmer.
“ Since your master is not at home, say I will call
again another day," said I, addressing Pepper-and-Salt, in
a key that might have been audible in the King's Theatre,
from Lady Harriet Vandeleur's box, to that of Madame
d'Acunha. “ All the family are well, I trust? -"
And the jerking gestures and stultified looks of the poor
wretch, as he replied with grateful civility, that “he was
werry much obliged to me. Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch
were both of 'em remarkable stout,” almost put me out of
conceit with my stratagem.
I wondered whether Emily overheard us? It was
indispensable she should see that, though obedient to her
commands, I was not unmindful of her welfare. But
whether I had her approval or not, I had my own. It
was a real triumph to feel that I had sacrificed a pleasant
party to Richmond, in order to effect my visit of inquiry
to Southampton Buildings.
Four and twenty hours afterwards, I began to wonder
what Lady Harriet Vandeleur thought of my desertion.
I knew what other people thought of it. Though I had
positively resolved to cut Jack Harris, — to cut him irre.
trievably, — with a bill-hook, — with a pale-axe, — with
whatever instrument effected the surest dismemberment, —
the fellow walked straight up to me in St. James's Street
with such an air of candour, that one might as easily have
thought of cutting one's own image in the glass.-
“ My dear Cis,” said he, “how unkind of you not to

warn me at once, last night, that I was on tender
ground.—You well know my regard for you, and that I
would ride a lame horse five miles in a pouring rain, to
avoid giving you annoyance.—Yet you permitted me to
make a jest of a person every way entitled to my respect,
even if not commanding it through her influence over your
feelings. Accept my sincere apologies, as well as my con-
gratulations on your happiness, in the acquaintance of the
prettiest woman in town.”
“Are you talking of Lady Harriet Vandeleur?”– cried
I, pretending to misunderstand him.
6 You are perfectly aware, my dear fellow, of whom I
am talking. As to Lady Harriet, no one will ever talk of
her beauty, so long as her countenance remains distorted
by the envy and jealousy it exhibited last night, during
your flirtation with the lovely Emily.”
How the deuce did he know that her name was Emily?
- I would not condescend to inquire ! - If I encouraged
his familiarity, he would, ten to one, ask me to present
him to Lady Harriet, or the Marchioness of Devereux, or
some other woinan to whom his audacity must have been
insupportable.
The next time I entered the Opera House, I prepared
myself to view with a throbbing heart, the scene of my
interesting adventure; more particularly as I knew that
Lady Harriet was gone to a breakfast at Payne's Hill, and
would be absent from her post of observation. That
Emily would be absent too, was equally certain, and a
source of very different feelings. It would, however, be
something to place myself in the seat she had occupied,
and devote my thoughts and recollections to her image.
To my utter surprise, however, not only had Madame
d'Acunha resumed her place by her husband, (a burly,
square-looking, chocolate-coloured Portuguese, who might
have put to flight a regiment of Jack Harrises,) but Miss
Barnet was again their companion ; not seated in front of
the box, indeed, — but the eyes of a lover readily espied
her.
“ I have taken the liberty of intruding upon you to
express a hope, that you sustained no injury from your

fatigues the other night,” said I, with all the awkwardness
of a school-boy. Finding myself graciously received, I
alluded slightly to having already relieved my anxieties on
her account by inquiry.
“ You are surprised, perhaps, to find me here again ?"
said Emily, with a blush inferring more than words, that
she felt in need of apology. “ But as we have exacted of
Monsieur d'Acunha not to leave us again, and shall quit
the theatre early in the ballet, I had not courage to deprive
myself of the Flauto Magico.”
I muttered something stupid, about being the last per-
son to find fault with any measure enabling me to see her
again. But she did not seem to listen. D’Acunha, to whom
she presented me on my entrance, interrupted us, with an
offer of his place, that I might have a better view of Tra-
mezzani's remarkably bad acting; to which I replied by
taking a seat at the back of the box, beside Emily. Her
companions were soon so thoroughly absorbed in the music,
as to afford me almost the enjoyment of a tête-à-tête.
She was looking just as usual. Not a plait altered in
her black gown,- not a curl in the arrangement of her
beautiful hair. It must have been her graciousness, there-
fore, which imparted a thousand new attractions to her
beauty. I saw her smile for the first time. For the first
time, her eyes assumed an expression of interest when I
addressed her.
- You English people,” said she, when the close of the
act enabled us to converse with freedom, “ can very little
enter into the love of music engendered by the climate and
early associations of southern countries. With you, music
is a luxury ; — with us, a necessary of life. I need not
inform you that the establishment of my guardian boasts
little to flatter the imagination. I have been three months
a prisoner in England, — cold, barren, cheerless, solemn
England; and the severest convent of my native country,
with the harmonies of its religious service and fragrance of
its genial atmosphere, would have been, comparatively, a
garden of Eden.”
or Do not found your ideas of England exclusively upon
the experience of Southampton Buildings !” cried I.

“Our summers have their orange blossoms as well as your
own, and our "
“ No, no !—don't pretend to tell me that you have as
much taste for music as animates the poorest water-carrier
in Lisbon ! _" interrupted Emily. “I have rarely missed
a representation at this theatre. Impossible to see a colder
or less attentive audience !-- Perhaps you have too many
other pleasures to affix much importance to music. You
come here with such a display of luxury, that it is easy to
see you stand in no need of it as a consolation. It con-
stitutes only one of the refinements of fashion. With us,
it is more. It is part of our religion ;- it is part of our
foretaste of heaven; — a balm for sorrow,- a substitute
for the prosperities of life.”—
“ Doomed to the society of old Hanmer, and the attend-
ance of Pepper-and-Salt !”—was my silent and involuntary
reflection, as I fixed my eyes upon the countenance beam-
ing with sensibility, that gave force to her expressions.
“ Poor girl! - No wonder she has recourse to the Flauto
Magico to sweeten her imagination.”
" Are you likely to remain long in this country ? -"
said I, with the benevolent project of effecting, through
my mother, some improvement in her position.
“ Alas! who can say ! - My father is a Lisbon mer-
chant, resident at Cintra. The grievous aspect of public
affairs in Portugal determined him to profit by the de-
parture of his friends, the d’Acunhas, to afford me a home
in England ; and apprehensive, perhaps, that their igno-
rance of the customs of this country might endanger my
comfort, he obtained a provisional shelter for me in the
house of his old acquaintance and correspondent, Mr. Han-
mer. Twenty years have elapsed since my father quitted
England. He was, therefore, unable to appreciate - he
did not exactly understand — he — in short for why
should I not speak openly ? -I have written to entreat
that he will either recall me, or find me a more suitable
abode.”
I was inexpressibly gratified by her frankness ; the more
so, that her previous reserve sufficed to prove she did not
lightly accord her confidence.

As we grew more intimate, I even ventured to tax her
with her hauteur at our two first interviews.
“ Would you have had me otherwise ? --” cried she.
“ Consider how bitterly my pride was hurt on finding
myself treated by a stranger as a subordinate of Mr. Han-
mer's establishment.”
“ I addressed you, surely, as his daughter ? _”
" During my residence with him, I had heard enough
of Lord Ormington and his affairs, to understand that his
lordship's son was scarcely ignorant of Mr. Hanmer's being
unmarried.”
“ Conceive how little interest I can have attached to
the private affairs of my father's solicitor ! — Believe me,
my offence was unintentional. -"
" At least let us now proclaim an amnesty !” cried
Emily. “My pride has been sufficiently rebuked by
finding myself in need of the kindness of one to whom it
had been unjustly exhibited. Be your own indiscretion
visited, in its turn, by a little compunction for having
driven me to the resource of hauteur as a guarantee against
intrusion. My situation at Mr. Hanmer's is a peculiar
one. Without intending to wound my feelings, he gave
me to understand, on learning our first interview - but
we will say no more about it ! - War is over !- In place
of disagreeable reminiscences, let us set about the improve-
ment of peace.”
I had always lived in the company which has the
assurance to call itself the best. In that best, Lady
Ormington was cited for the elegance of her manners.
The world, that superficial observer, is apt to mistake
appearance for deportment; and the merit for which a
woman is indebted to the amount of her milliner's bill is
often set down to grace of manner. I do not mean to
say that my mother's were faulty. She could be charining
enough, when worth her while. But she never played to
empty benches. Like the country manager who could not
afford to give the snow-storm in his Christmas pantomime
with white paper, when the audience was thin, she often
“ snowed brown,” and was peevish and ungracious till
further notice.

Lady Harriet, too, was a person remarked for what the
great world call high-breeding. My notion of high-
breeding is the manner that raises others to your level,
without at any moment allowing you to descend to theirs,
- the essential characteristic of high birth. But Lady
Harriet, instead of placing other people at their ease, only
contrived to show how much she was at ease herself, often
at the cost of comfort to her associates. She was restless,
too — nay, worse, she was artificial. Her naïveté was
calculated, her impromptus were faits à loisir. She could
be courtly and refined, it is true. But to be courtly does
not imply to be well-bred.
In Emily's manner, on the contrary, I descried indi-
cations of that intuitive elegance, as inseparable from cer-
tain natures as fragrance from certain flowers. When
offended, she was a queen ; — when pleased, a child. — Of
the conventions of society, she knew nothing. All her
ideas of decorum emanated from instinctive modesty. My
coxcombry was as much thrown away upon her, as the
beauty of some exquisite piece of mechanism on a savage.
But when she approved when by chance I gave utter-
ance to a sentiment that found sympathy with her own,
the moisture of her eye was instantaneous; or if some
chance expression — some passing sarcasm - happened to
divert her, her pearly teeth became visible in a moment,
brightening the cordial smiles respondent to my efforts for
her entertainment.
For I did try to entertain her. Every opera-night, I
was as faithful to my post, as Spagnoletti to his. The
d'Acunhas, aware of the annoyance to which Emily had
been subjected by the homage paid to her beauty, favoured
her wish to remain constantly in the back-ground; and
between their passionate love of music, and approval of
Emily's modest retreat from the public gaze, I had the
field to myself.
I was now perfectly at home among them. Though
ordinary-looking people enough, there was something in
their unsociable isolation in the midst of a great metro-
polis, that redeemed them from vulgarity. Emily gave
me to understand that their affairs, as well as those of her

i
father, (of whom she spoke with the fondest affection,)
were deeply involved in the precarious destinies of their
native country; and that their whole time was absorbed
in business connected with the finances of Portugal, save
the half-dozen hours a week which they snatched for the
consolation of music.
They were at enmity, it seemed, with old Hanmer ;
misunderstandings having arisen out of their mutual position
relative to the guardianship of Miss Barnet; and this was, I
conclude, the motive of their silence respecting my growing
intimacy with his ward. Though nothing passed between
us on the subject, I saw distinctly that my name was never
mentioned to him, either by Emily or her friends.
Luckily for me that the Opera was only twice a-week!
- The career of fashion and fortune I had traced for
myself would unquestionably have been nipped in the bud.
To pass more of my time in the society of a rational
being, rational without homeliness, rational without a
single drawback, (save that she was only Emily Barnet,
and I, the Honourable Cecil Danby,) must have endan-
gered my coxcombry as well as my heart.
Yet I don't know! The limitation of my pleasures
only served, perhaps, to increase the risk. I could see
her at no other time or place; but other sources of diver-
sion were ever open to me. Emily alone, imprisoned in
the dirty old den of my father's man of business, was
as-uncome-atable as a queen surrounded by her household
brigade. Had it been any other person's man of business,
I would have defied him ; but old Hanmer would have
assuredly communicated my visits to Lord Ormington ;
and Lord Ormington's displeasure, as I have said before,
was not to be trifled with.
Meanwhile, the happiness of the hour sufficed me. At
twenty-and-a-half, one stands between yesterday and to-
morrow, independent of either. To-day contains an em-
pire ; and Heaven knows I had all things to put me in
conceit with my reign! The liberalities of my mother
rendered my allowance almost superfluous. It was her
duty, she said, to take care that my first season in town
reflected no disgrace upon herself.

“ Next year,” said her ladyship, “ if you do vulgar or
foolish things, it is you who will be put to shame; for by
that time, you will have obtained a name. At present,
people would only say, in alluding to your blunders, ' It
is that silly son of Lady Ormington's !' I must beg,
therefore, Cis, that you will be more cautious in your
conduct. You made me get you invitations to the
Duchess's Loo-parties, to — House, to the Mar-
chioness of Devereux's, to twenty other places, which
do not open their doors indiscriminately; and, after all
my trouble, you have not shown your face at one of

“My face is highly flattered that its absence should be
remarked,” said I, coolly. " It is more than would have
happened to its honourable elder brother's.”

invitations. By the way, your brother is come to town.”

coach !”
“I am heartily glad to hear it,” replied I, gravely;
“ for he is not the man who can afford to follow his own
conceit in such matters. If Danby were seen giving his
arm to a woman who looked like a housemaid, he would
naturally be mistaken for a footman!”
“ While you, I suppose, flatter yourself that you are
only taken for a roué ! However, there is roué and roué;
and I can promise you, Cis, that obscure follies of that
description -"
“ Follies of what description ?” cried I, interrupting
her. “ Explain these mysterious allusions to bonnets. By
whom have I ever been seen loitering on any back-stairs,
save those of St. James's ?”—
“ By Lady Harriet Vandeleur, I conclude; who in-
formed me you were degenerating horribly; that you did
nothing you ought —”.

« Nothing I ought?” — cried I, again interrupting
her. « Lord Votefilch considers me a model for the
official youth of Britain !- He has even given me sun-
dry hints, that if I did not write so cursed bad a hand,
and spelt a little better, he would make me his private
secretary !”
“ I am sure you don't write much worse than other
young men !” exclaimed my mother, peevishly. “ How-
ever, I suppose you only say it to make me nervous ;
for I know, through Hanmer, who heard it from Lord
Ormington, that they are satisfied with you at the
office.”
This was rather a discursive mode for the intelligence
to reach my mother! However, I was getting tolerably
accustomed to our family oddities.
Lady Ormington's sarcasms about ladies in bonnets did
not frighten me from my usual resorts. The charm I
found in Emily's society was beyond all dread of vulgar
censure; nor did I enjoy it the less, for my conviction
that mine was not disagreeable to herself. She made
no effort to attract me. There was no eagerness in her
manner of recommending herself; nor any pretensions, on
my part, to the character of a lover. As we became more
intimate, I refrained from even the demonstrations of
admiration inevitable on our first acquaintance. I had my
own dignity to maintain, as she hers; and though content
that she should be aware of my deep devotion, chose to
remain le plus debout possible pour être à genoux.
This did not injure my cause. Emily had every pre-
text for accepting my civilities as those of an acquaint-
ance; and no sooner had she ceased to fear that a show
of kindness might draw down upon her the crisis of a
declaration, than she became perfectly at her ease.
A child could not have let fall its words more artlessly
than Emily, when describing the habits of her early life;
her father's house at Cintra ; her orange-gardens, her
mountains, her thickets of myrtle, her choir of nightingales;
her despair when apprized of the necessity of quitting all
these, to dwell among strangers in a foreign country,— a
northern country,— a Protestant country!

66 And yet,” she added, with a smile, “ how far was I
from surmising all the horrors of England, or imagining
the mean narrowness of a house of business in Southampton
Buildings !--I have heard my father speak of Mr. Hanmer
as enormously wealthy.-- Yet what enjoyment does he
allow himself ? - In what intellectual effort does he in-
dulge ? — Books, music, flowers, are as much unknown in
his house, as if such things had no existence. My father,
too, is a man of business. My father is a mere merchant;
but our house is bright with pictures,- our garden gay
with flowers ! — A day spent without music or reading,
would seem a lost day to us! - How is this ? —Are all
your professional people as dull, cold, and inelegant, as
those I see ? - Is conversation considered, in all your
societies, an idle waste of words ?”-
“ The conversation in which you deign to take a part,
would everywhere be appreciated!” I replied. But I
could not but look with compassion on this plant of a
southern clime, crushed by the practical habits of our
middle classes ; checked for the joyousness of spirit which,
in every country but money-making England, is cherished
and encouraged ; and censured for carelessness of forms,
the growth of an inferior order of society.
All my care was to soothe the vexations of Emily, and
remedy her sense of isolation. I tried to connect her,
through my sympathy, with the sympathies of others. I
described London society to her, in all its subdivisions;
country society, in all its ponderous complications. I told
her what we were, what we had been, what we ought to
be. The merest trifles illustrative of our social existence,
seemed to amuse her. The details of my mother's estab-
lishment were laid before her, as minutely as an interior
by Mieris ; nay, even my own apartments, with all their
common-place associations, were painted for her amuse-
ment, as I have painted them for that of the reader.
It was curious enough that my object was to reconcile
her to England, and reduce her into one of the million ;
while the influence she exercised over myself, sufficed to
detach me from the mass. Till I knew her, I had acted
upon the impulses of others; had existed but as a leaf

upon the tree.—I had now an individual identity, derived
from an existence as dear as it was dangerous !-
A disagreeable surprise was about to startle me to new
perceptions. I have described the era of which I am
writing, as the age of slang. But those only who retain
personal recollections of the coaching “ peers of many
capes,” with their bang-up pastimes, the ring and the road,
their vociferousness at public places, their brutality at the
Fives-Court, their activity at 0. P. rows and Opera riots,
can form an idea of the eccentric peculiarity of my
brother's mild reserve and studious seclusion, in the midst
of the general uproar. Danby was certainly not one of
those who are fated to make a noise in the world !
“I have seen your brother ! —” said Emily one night,
as I assumed my usual place by her side.
“I trust he had the honour of pleasing you ? " said I,
almost coxcombically. But my gaiety subsided at the
thought that she had perhaps, in her turn, attracted his
attention.
“May I ask,” I resumed, “ where Danby was so for-
tunate as to meet you?”—
“ You are very formal, — very ceremonious to-night !”
- cried she, in some surprise. “Having heard that “Mr.
Danby' was in the drawing-room with my guardian, and
being unaware that you had a brother,—"
- You wished to ascertain whether I cut as awkward
a figure as ever on the hearth-rug in Southampton
Buildings !”
“What would Mr. Hanmer have said, pray, on finding
us such intimate acquaintance ? -No! no! I indulged my
curiosity by a still more disgraceful proceeding. I was
foolish enough to watch from my window the horse
waiting in the street, till I saw its master jump into his
saddle.
" Then you certainly did not see my brother !_” said
I, interrupting her. “ Danby was never known to jump
in his life — not even at a conclusion !"-
" Why play upon my imperfect knowledge of your lan-
guage ? — It was your brother; though certainly nothing in
his appearance indicated the relationship. But Mr. Hanmer

mentioned at dinner that Lord Ormington's son had been
with him, preparatory to taking his seat in parliament.”
“ Parliament? - Danby in parliament ?- Am I fated to
receive all my news of home through the medium of
Southampton Buildings ?” cried I pettishly, deeply vexed
at the prospect of worldly distinctions wasted on this elder
brother.
Why is it, by the way, that, according to the attestation
of ancient history and modern gossip, from the days of
Cain and Abel, and Jacob and Esau, down to those of the
two Chéniers and the two Danbys, there has existed so
much fraternal discordance between almost every pair of
brothers ? Is it that between two sons, parental affection
hath its ups and downs, like a swing or a balance ? -
Or does it arise from the inherent perversity of human
nature ? -I must confess I had, in my early youth, an
antipathy to John ! -- Not because he was my elder brother.
No! - my feelings towards him were as those of Faulcon-
bridge :- I would not have exchanged fortunes with him,
to have exchanged faces. Ormington Hall and Hanover
Square would have been poor compensation for the wretch-
edness of bearing about that frightful physiognomy,- that
ignoble person, — those stooping, narrow shoulders, -
those long graceless arms, — eyes that, conscious of defect,
quailed under those of others, – and hair approaching to
the reprobated Judas hue. — Life was not worth living for,
with these defeatures. I would not have been a duke on
such a penalty !--
Emily's information, meanwhile, was as authentic as it
was strange. The next day, Lord Votefilch, in taking
some papers from my hands, congratulated me, that “ his
Majesty's government was about to receive an accession of
strength by my brother's entrance into parliament.”
I said nothing, -I only smiled. — But my smile, I
conclude, was significant.
“We have very high accounts of the abilities of
Mr. Danby,” added he, gravely, as if replying to my
smile.
“ From Lord Ormington, my lord ? -"
“ No, sir. — His lordship recommended his second son

to our attention ; but he tendered us, at the same time,
the services of his elder. He brings in Mr. Danby for his
own borough. There was no occasion for overlauding
him. The obligation is conferred on us.”
I bit my lips.
T “ It is from Cambridge we have heard so much in his
honour,” persisted his lordship. “Mr. Danby distinguished
himself nobly at the University ; but he has accredited
himself still more, by subsequently devoting his time, in
defiance of all the temptations of society, to a course of
severe study. Your brother, sir, has been brought up
in the old school. Your brother brings more into the
| market than mere talent.
'2s oudev ý uabnous, nu un vous sapn.” -
Old Votefilch was vain of his own academic distinctions;
and the old fellow was slily slipping on his crown of
laurels, under shelter of my brother's wing.
“I sincerely trust, my lord,” said I, “ that Danby may
add another name to the catalogue of those who, to the
honours of the University, have added the more glorious
distinctions of public life. May your lordship not be
disappointed in your expectations !”.
On the following Saturday, his Majesty's lieges were
acquainted by his Majesty's Gazette, that
“For the borough of Rigmarole, John Alexander Dan-
by, commonly called the Honourable John Alexander
Danby, was returned to serve in this present parliament,
vice John Julius Fudge, Esq., who had accepted the
Chiltern Hundreds.”
I suppose I ought to have felt proud at this announce-
ment: – I felt angry. Fate was heaping a great deal too
much upon the Honourable John Alexander. He was be-
ginning to monopolize the good things of this world. After
being exiled to the nursery in his nankin frock, and to
lodgings in his superfine blue one, to be thus suddenly
snatched into public notice! — Lady Ormington cared as
little for him, as she had done three-and-twenty years
before. But Cambridge it seemed, “bragged of him, as of
a virtuous and well-governed youth ;” and his Majesty's

cabinet ministers had been pleased to lend their long ears
to her vauntings. Even Emily Barnet spoke of him as if
interested in his success. For my part, I should have
cared as much for that of our chétif cousin, little Squeamy.
“You will go and hear your brother make his first
speech ? ” cried Emily, whose heart was warm with the
sympathies of every generous affection.
“I wish I had nothing worse to do with my time, than
dance attendance in the House of Commons, for the chance
of hearing the Honourable Member for Rigmarole give utter-
ance to a few words inaudible in the gallery !”— cried I.
“However, Danby is just as little likely to come and listen
to an harangue of mine, unless from the Dock of the Old
Bailey, or a cart at Tyburn. He despises me as the young
Hopeless of the family ; and we might pass for a fashion-
able couple, so complete is our alienation. Do not look so
shocked!” — cried I, startled by her grave countenance.
" Is it the abhorrence of cant and exaggeration, which
so often betrays you English people into abuse of your
relations and calumny of yourselves ? ” — said she in re-
ply. “ Bossuet tells us to beware of those who exceed in
goodness ; as there is nothing more suspicious than a pre-
tension to exorbitant virtues. But I see no reason for
falling into the opposite extreme.”
This well-earned reproof vexed me, as seeming to take
part with my brother. I was born without a genius for
family affection. I am much inclined to doubt whether
such instincts exist; or rather, whether the love of kindred
be not the mere result of education. In mine, sympathy
with any living thing, save Dash and Bibiche, had never
been even hinted at by my mother. I might have been
reared in a tribe of Iroquois, with more exhortation to
humanity. As to John and Julia, once or twice, when
our respective nurses interfered with our fisticuffs, and in-
flicted upon Master and Miss Danby, on whom alone they
were permitted to exercise their jurisdiction, the study of
that pleasing lyric of the mellifluous Watts,
Birds in their little nests agree,
my mother was sure to mar the business by carrying me

off to Gunter's or Wetten's, and rewarding my domestic
sufferings with pralines and maccaroons.
As to proceeding to the House of Commons, to behold
poor Danby vibrate like a pendulum between his two long
arms, (“two eel skins stuffed, ”) while giving utterance to
his maiden stammer, though neither the eloquence of
Windham or Grattan, Curran or Canning, ever attracted
me into that den of honest men, - I might have made the
sacrifice to my sense of what was due to the family name,
had he deigned to express a proper desire for my coun-
tenance. But in this, as in all else, he maintained towards
me the haughtiest reserve. As a matter of taste, politics
delighted me not, nor politicians neither. At a dinner-
party, they are crammed down one's throat by one's neigh-
bours, as fish sauces are forced upon one by the butler.
But I was not much of a dining-out man; and when
political dinners occurred in Hanover Square, usually hur-
ried incog. to Sablonière's, and skulked en polisson to the
theatre.
It was consequently an unlooked-for blow, when, one
morning, as I took my accustomed place at the office, i. e.
before the fire-place, with my hands under the skirts of
my coat, I was beset with congratulations by the “ seven
other devils worse than myself,” who shared with me in
Downing Street the laborious task of cursing the climate,
and inquiring how went the enemy, (I don't mean the
enemy in Spain, but the enemy at the Horse Guards; I
don't mean H. R. H. the Commander-in-chief, but the
time-keeper of London and Westminster.) For a moment,
I fancied I was going to be married ; and longed to satisfy
myself whether Emily or lady Harriet were the favoured
fair ;— more especially, as each of them brandished a
morning paper, to give force to his felicitations, as the
tragedians of England smite their bosom or touch their
sword, in allusion to their conscience or their valour.
The newspapers evidently contained the germ of my good
fortune. The newspapers had probably hitched me into
some announcement of “ Fashionable Hymeneals.”
I was wrong. The newspapers announced the apotheosis
of the Honourable John Danby, not the demise of his

brother !— The newspapers set forth that his Majesty's
government had to congratulate itself on an accession of
the most powerful nature, in the person of the Member
for Rigmarole. A new Chatham was born unto them,-
a “heaven-born minister,”— risen like a Phønix from the
ashes of him of whom port-wine and Austerlitz had deprived
the British Empire.
Could such things be
And overcome me like a summer cloud,
Without my special wonder ?
Could I, Cecil the coxcomb, be wide awake, and Danby,
the Honourable John,- the awkward, squinting boy,
have become a man, and a man of genius ? — My whole
frame tingled with irritation at the supposition !-
“ You are a made man, Cis, my boy!” cried young
Lord Chippenham, one of my clerkly colleagues.
“ I sincerely wish you joy, Mr. Danby;" added Halbert
Herries, another of my brother slaveys. Congratulations
(damn them !) were showered upon me, like bouquets on
an opera dancer.
As I sauntered up St. James's Street at the close of the
day, and now that Lady Harriet's influence was in abey-
ance I no longer made short cuts across the Birdcage
Walk,- matters went still worse. The Cocoa-tree stared
at me with its leaden eyes, as I lounged along. The
Albion, albeit unused to demonstration, rushed to its bay-
window to gaze. Boodle's shrugged its round shoulders
as I passed ; even the chairman of White's and Brookes's,
seemed to whisper to each other (for Connaught Bill and
his cub had rendered my name familiar in their mouths as
household words,) “ Arrah now, isn't yeonder broth iv a
boy own brother to the new great parli'ment man, what 's
to bate Charlie and Billy to everlasting smitherens ?”
To be immortalized by a leaf from the laurels of John
Danby,— to be brightened by a ray from his luminous
countenance,-“Oh! what a falling off was there!”–
Was such the reward of all my labour? _Was it for this
I had excruciated myself in boots, agonizing as the shirt
of Nessus ? Was it for this I had closeted myself for
consultation with Stultz, with a degree of mystery, worthy

of Guido Fawkes and Garnet ? — Was it for this I had
abjured hunting, for the sake of my figure, and shooting,
for love of my complexion? - Was it for this I had
anointed myself with the oil of Macassar above my fel-
lows ? —Was it for this I had delivered to Hendrie, under
the patent of my seal, the original recipe for the Danby
washball ? - To be overcrowed by an elder brother, — a
squinting elder brother,—a man unknown to White's, -
ignored by Watier's ; – whom, had he pleaded the loss of
his ticket to the door-keepers of the Argyle Rooms, not a
humanized being, from Colonel Greville to the linkboys,
could have identified as a man of (dis-)respectability !-
I was afraid to dine at my Club that day. All the
world seemed in league to fling my brother in my teeth.
I was afraid even Sablonière's might fail to respect my
incognito. Even at the Bedford, or some other slang
house of my unaccustomed haunts, I should be recog-
nized and pointed out as the Castor of Pollux the politician.
- In the plenitude of my weakness, I determined to dine
at home.
Never shall I forget Lord Ormington's face that day !-
Monk Lewis had just then brought into fashion, Tales of
Wonder treating of dead bodies taken possession of by
the evil one, and playing a posthumous part in the world.
Here was a Tale of Wonder mise en action !--- His lord-
ship, usually as dull and dumb as if defunct, appeared
suddenly animated, - suddenly spiritualized,- till at the
last he spake with his tongue. The devil was in him that
day. He was almost jocose. He actually asked me to
take wine.
Strange to say, my mother waxed silent in proportion to
the fluency of her lord. Her ladyship and I seemed
dumb-foundered, because Danby had taken to speaking,
and Lord Ormington to talking. With me she was as
pettish as if I had on one of Jack Harris's flashy waist-
coats ; actually resenting the triumphs of my father's
favourite, as a delinquency on the part of her own.
The most superficial observer might have discovered
that some very unusual occurrence had taken place in the
family ; for his lordship’s carriage was announced half an

hour earlier than usual. For once, he was bound to the
Commons, instead of the Lords. A world of paternity
sparkled in his triumphant looks! - The pigtail of my
lord's own man seemed to vibrate with delight when, as
he brought in his lordship's coffee, he whispered that the
chariot was in waiting.
" I do not inquire whether you have read your brother's
speech,” said Lord Ormington, as he was about to quit
the room, with far more of the nobleman in his air than I
had ever yet seen him assume. _“I know that you have
not ;-I did not even expect it of you !”—and his man-
ner plainly implied, “ being totally incompetent to appre-
hend its merits and intention.” “ But lest you should
commit yourself in the world by ignorance of its purport,"
- he continued, fixing his eyes firmly upon mine, -
“ know that it was on the Catholic question, - that it
carried away the House ;—and that I possess in the future
representative of my family, a son for whom the esteem of
the kingdom will shortly afford confirmation of my own.”
Such was the first item of family intelligence which
Lord Ormington condescended to communicate to me,
otherwise than through the professional mouths of Messrs.
Hanmer and Snatch, of Southampton Buildings !-

catholic Hibernia exclaim to evangelic England, as the
taunter in Tom Thumb —
You made the giant first and then you kill'd it !
It was a good giant enough, however, in its time, to
have its head smitten off by the riders in the quintain ;-
a capital cockshy for parliamentary schoolboys, -- an
excellent coral to assist the dentition of teething states-
men.-
Everybody familiar with the routine of public schools,
is conversant with the list of magnanimities set apart by
the masters, as themes for the twaddling of the inexperi-
enced in belles lettres ; such as “ Marathon," “Re-
gulus,”-" The Revival of the Arts,”-“ The Clemency
of Titus,”—and so forth ; concerning each of which well-
worn topics, the Dr. Dronebys of successive generations
are as conversant with every epithet and every argument
to be put in requisition, as if already printed in small pica
among the pages of Blair's Lessons, or Stretch's Beauties of
History.
Even so must the Speakers of the House have regarded
for a quarter of a century the annual orations on Catholic
emancipation. I can scarcely persuade myself that the
intolerance of England was spouted out of countenance by
the braying of these donkeys, as the walls of Jericho were
overthrown by the braying of trumpets ; but the canvass
did very well as a sampler to be flourished upon by the
or promising young men.” My brother's periods were
about as much to the purpose as Rode's variations; and
had I not forsworn politics in the narrative of my adven-
tures, I would bring forward a little theory of my own on
this point, almost worthy the solemnities of a Quarterly
Review.
Stung to the quick by the triumph of Lord Ormington's
son in the House, I was not sorry to find that Lady
Ormington's had distinguished himself in the coteries by a
mot aptly concentrating the pith of the Irish question.
“ So your brother has immortalized himself by a speech
upon Ireland ?” said Lady Harriet Vandeleur, addressing
me across the Duchess of Moneymusk's dinner-table,
evidently for the purpose of provocation.

“ Poor Ireland !-” was my reply, (accompanied by a
significant elevation of the shoulders — implying — “ will
no one let her alone ?") “ The question of her legislation
seems to me to resolve itself into the proposition suggested
by Camille Desmoulins, concerning France and the Con-
vention :-' La Convention a trouvé la France sans
culotte ; sa gloire et son chef-d'auvre seront de la rendre
culottée !!' --Whoever shall rid green Erin of her rags, will
work greater wonders in her behalf than by allowing her to
tell her own beads, or palaver in her own parliament.”
The diners-out applauded; for they were displeased by
the triumph of a man like Danby, unknown to fame
through their premonitory flourish of trumpets. But they
dared not protest against him. There was no plausible
“ because” to preface their “ dissentients.” His speech
was allowed to be a good speech. The Universities were
pleased, because it showed a spice of scholarship ; the
country, because it was indicted in manly English ; the
town, because its wisdom was not altogether devoid of wit.
As if wit were more or less than the animus of wisdom :-
legitimate offspring of an union between good sense and
good spirits !
Still, amid all these plaudits, Thersites found something
to rail at. The bitter bile of sarcasm engendered by the
repletion of society, brought a sneer to its jaundiced cheek.
Single-speech Hamilton was quoted ; and the speech of
the Honourable Member for Rigmarole, when printed, was
decided to be a prize essay. The knowing ones pretended
to discover a cotton weft through the rich pile of the
velvet.
When the subject was broached in my presence, I took
refuge, like other false prophets, in mysticism. My French
quotation having served my cause so well, I replied to all
questions concerning the abilities of my brother — “ Entre
l'apparent et le réel, il y a tout un abime !” — much as my
boy Tim would have hinted that “ the proof of the pud-
din' was in the ating.”
One day, shortly after the sudden sprouting of the
Danby laurels, I received a note from my Fee-faw-fum,
Lord Votefilch, begging me to look out certain confidential

documents, the whereabout of which in Downing Street
was exclusively known to myself, and bring them to the
House. The Opposition had thrown a hand grenade into
the ministerial camp ; and it was necessary to clear away
the wreck caused by its explosion.
Half an hour afterwards, having fulfilled his orders, I
lounged for a moment into the gallery. There was a
great hubbub. That tumultuous assemblage which calls
itself a deliberative body, was considerably out of order;
the light troops of the Opposition having been skirmish-
ing like Pandours! When lo ! a sudden lull succeeded
to the raging of the billows :- " after the tempest a still
small voice !"-
In a moment you might have heard a pin fall. There
is something awful in the self-stilling of a public assem-
bly ; — a tribute from the passions of the many to the
power of the one ; -
The power of thought,- the magic of the mind, -
that power which no man could hold, “ unless it were
given him from above !”.
Even I, though thwarted by having my habits and
privacy invaded by the dirty work of the nation, and who
had arrived at the House in a bitter bad temper, even I
could not refuse to hear the voice of the charmer when
I found him charming so wisely that even the cunning
old serpents of debate-shirkers, crept out of their holes in
the lobby; while the murmurs of the Opposition died
away, like a night-storm at the dawn of morning.
It is an interesting sight, for people sufficiently Catholic
in their spirit to cast away party feeling and interest them-
selves in the lights and shadows of public life, to watch
the gradual developement of opinion consequent on a fine
piece of oratory, in an enlightened assemblage. Such a
public assembly as the parliament of 1810, was an instru-
ment that responded visibly, or rather audibly, to the touch
of a skilful player. He whose hand I found upon the
chords, was a player less adroit than powerful; the ear
recognised at once the inspiration of genius. I was so
placed that my eye commanded the opposition benches ;
but not a glimpse of the speaker. I saw him only as a

divinity is manifested, - in the devotion of his worship-
pers, and the despair of the devils he hath cast out. The
brows of the leading Opposition members were contracted,
— their lips compressed !-- But not a vestige of scorn,
not a gesture of levity.—They bore the sledge-hammer
blows dealt upon them, with the surly self-respecting
desperation of an Indian at the stake ; and one "may gene-
rally estimate the strength of an antagonist, by the attitude
in which his attack is parried.
Could I have allowed it to enter into the possibility of
things, that I, Cecil Danby, was ignorant of any matter
which it imported me to know, I should certainly have
addressed myself to my nearest neighbour, to inquire
the name of this powerful debater, this intellectual Milo,
who had silenced the bellowing of John Bull and was
carrying him off upon his shoulders. But for worlds,
I would not have committed a sin of ignorance on
such a point, in such a place ! The voice of the speaker
was new to me. Husky in the onset, perhaps from
infirmity, perhaps from excitement, it gradually cleared,
and —
Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,
as the soul of the orator expanded, and the moral over-
powered the material in his sensitive nature. My heart
thrilled as I listened. Half an hour before, I was not
sure that I possessed one !
There are as many modes of oratory as there are ways
to dress eggs, and there are even various modes, each of
which, others besides my friend Connaught Bill might be
pardoned for calling the best. The mode of the N.N. to
whom I was yielding breathless attention, was the very
type of style for a highly-born, highly-bred, highly-
educated, and consequently high-minded young man ;

the plague, communicated by the dust of the dead after a
century's interment !-
Joking apart, I was carried, away like the rest.
On the subsiding of the uproar of cheers consequent
upon this eloquent speech, (which embodied a reply as
forcible as elegant, to a ferocious attack upon the foreign
policy of government,) I found myself eagerly surrounded
- warmly congratulated.-
" I have thanks to offer to yourself, my dear Danby, as
well as to your brother,” said Lord Votefilch, when in-
forming me, shortly afterwards, that my documents came
too late ; “ for I am convinced it must be your informa.
tion which has placed our invaluable champion in a
situation to come forward thus readily, The finest reply
that has been heard within these walls these ten years ! -
Not a living orator, sir, has a chance against your brother!
- The Napoleon of debate ! — If an usurper, he knows
how to make his usurpation respected.”—
I could have killed old Votefilch for the complacent
crush of the hand, enforcing these effusions of his grati-
tude !-
There was a dreadful struggle in my feelings. Had
I been left to myself, had there been no one but Cis
Danby and the victorious gladiator under the roof of
St. Stephen's, I verily believe I should have thrown myself
on his neck, as Benjamin on that of Joseph, and claimed
fraternal fellowship with his nobleness. But the warmth of
others chilled me. The exaggerated enthusiasm chaunting
forth the praises of Danby, only that its own voice might
be audible, reduced mine to silence; and my heart was as
hard as Pharaoh's.
To escape the conflicting batteries of St. James's Street
I made straight for Buckingham Gate ; though with no
intention, on this occasion, of surprising Colonel Morley
knocking at the bower-chamber-door of his lady fair. I
was on foot. It was a fine June afternoon. The shade
and verdure of the Park ought to have refreshed me. But,
by Heavens ! through all the stillness of the Birdcage
Walk, where scarce a gnat or a nursery-maid was stirring,
I seemed to hear over again, like the roar of the ocean in

a dream, the tumultuous plaudits of the House! I wa
brother-ridden. The soul of Cain was within me; o
rather the soul of that Cain of civilization, the terribl
Franz von Moor.
The first thing that roused me from my meditations,
was a cheerly voice that saluted me as I was approaching
Tattersall's; round whose gates, a detachment of tilburies,
stanhopes, and led-horses were clustered.
" Anything my way, Mr. Danby, sir ?" inquired Fet-
lock, touching his hat, and joining me on my way towards
Hyde Park Corner. “ As pretty a little bit of blood in my
stable, just now, Mister Danby, sir, as you'd wish to see!
-Let you have it a bargain, as the season's getting on :
- carry a lady, like an arm-chair, sir !--The very thing
for a gemman as knows what he's about, Mister Danby,
sir; and 'twould give me pleasure now, (if 'twas only for
knowing what pride her la’ship, Lady Ormington, would
take to see you so prettily mounted,) to let you have the
mare on terms as might be agreeable. -A young gemman,
like you, Mr. Danby, sir, which leads the fashion among
the tip-tops —”
“Good morning, Fetlock !”— said I, seizing the oppor-
tunity of having reached the crossing by St. George's
Hospital, to send him to Coventry or to Pimlico, while
I proceeded into Hyde Park. For I could not stand
being flattered by a horse-dealer at such a moment. It
was like Correggio, sinking broken-hearted under the
load of copper coin, -- the ignominious guerdon of his
abilities.
On reaching home, I found Lady Ormington so despe-
rately“ nervous,” (Ang. out of humour,) that I concluded
she had already learned the new triumph of her first-born.
I was mistaken. She knew nothing about the matter, and
cut me short at mere mention of the House of Com-
mons.
“You know I don't care a pin for politics !” said she.
“Why plague me about such nonsense, particularly when
you see me so nervous ! Just conceive your aunt Agatha
taking it into her head that she is well enough to come to
town !”

“You know I don't care a pin for my aunt Agatha.
Why plague me about such nonsense ? ” — retorted her
graceless son : “ but why, pray, may she not come to town
when she likes?"
“ The season is more than half over. What can be
the use of dragging Julia all the way up from Devonshire,
now that the birth-day is past ? - I am convinced they
only do it to torment me!"-.
“ It is a long journey for so small a purpose, consider-
ing how easily your ladyship is tormented,” said I, gravely.
“ I cannot, however, see why they should remain at Sid.
mouth during the dog-days. The summer has set in severer
than usual ; and I understood it was only during the winter
months, Baillie ordered the old lady to a milder climate.”
" It is no question of the barometer !” cried Lady Or-
mington. “I see through it all ! — It is Julia's doing !
- It is all this stupid speech of Danby's !”
“You are in the minority in calling it stupid, my dear
mother,” cried I; “ and I have the pleasure of informing
you, that half an hour hence, the newsmen's horns will
render it impossible for you to remain ignorant that you
are again a grandmother!”
“Grandmother ? ” — reiterated Lady Ormington,
aghast, – the last person in the world to enter into a joke.
- Grandmother to a chef-d'æuvre engendered by John's
flirtations with the tuneful Nine,” said I, laughing.
“ Speaking again so soon? - What nonsense! I have
often heard poor Sir Lionel say, there was nothing the
House detested so much as a callow member, chirruping
before it knew how to tune up its pipes. I am sure the
reason these people have come up to town so unexpectedly,
is to enjoy his triumph! As to Julia, from the hour she
was born, she has thought of nobody but her elder brother.”
“ Because nobody else seems to have been at the trouble
of thinking of her!”
“ Lord Ormington wanted to have them all here to din-
ner to-day. But I told him plainly I was too nervous for
a family party. Besides, I have promised to be with the
Duchess early. She has got to go to the ball at Carlton
House after her Loo."

“Got to go!” — Lady Ormington's syntax was scarcely
so refined as that of her son.
“But why not take Julia with you to-night?” said I,
with the amiable intention of provoking her.
“Are you out of your mind, Cis ? ” cried she, rising
from the sofa, and placing Bibiché carefully. in her basket.
“Lord Ormington and his sisters would as soon let Julia
set foot in a pest-house, as go to the Duchess of Money-
musk's. I do not interfere with the scruples of their de-
corumships, those two old maids. As they have been kind
enough (in consideration of my wretched state of health,)
to undertake the task of introducing Miss Danby into the
world, it would ill become me (would it, my pretty Bi-
biche ?) to counteract their system of education. By the
way, Cis, remember that Lord Ormington will take it
amiss if you do not call on these people to-morrow!”-
I looked vaguely acquiescent. But I had cares, at that
moment, far more critical than maiden aunts or a red-
haired sister. I was about to make my début at Carlton
House! Thanks to personal influence, (certainly not that
of Lord Ormington, who had no more interest in the beau
monde than I with the bench of bishops,) I had received
an invitation from the Prince; and, till the startling event
of my brother's succès, experienced inexpressible delight at
a circumstance which I knew would be wormwood to
Jack Harris and Lady Harriet's roué Colonel.
Oh! inimitable Mrs. Davenport ! – Mrs. Davenport,
whom Charles Lamb defined as “ Garrick in petticoats,"

wert then playing to perfection the part invented by Mor-
ton for thy transcendant merits, – how often has thy
exclamatiom of “ What will Mrs. Grundy say ? ” since
recurred to my conscience, in the course of my profitless
career! For those few simple words contain the germ of a
a thousand catastrophes,—the heart of a thousand mysteries,
- the secret of a thousand downfals! The ruin of almost
every imprudent family may be traced to the influence of a

ness of public men, the speculations of private, are caused,
nine times in ten, by the ambition of eclipsing some inti-
mate friend or intimate foe, the Mrs. Grundy of our several
destinies ! -
Apart, however, from the desire of astonishing my rivals
in love and coxcombry, I was overjoyed at the prospect of
entering that renowned circle, – the school of my art, —
the cradle of infant dandyism, — the incipient Order that
was to supersede the bucks, ruffians, and bang-up gentle-
men of the road, so long in possession of the pavé.
" Away with such triflers !” cries the sage, flinging
aside our pages into the depths of his gloomy library, as
if the grubbers among the dry bones of history did more
to expedite the progress of the times, than those fluttering
butterflies who oppose, at least, no dead weight to the
general impetus. Like a straw thrown up to determine
the course of the wind, the triflers of any epoch are an
invaluable evidence of the bent of the public mind. They
are always floating on the surface, — always ostensible ! -
They are a mark for general observation. Statesmen and
beaux are the only really public men. Posterity will see,
in Brummell and Castlereagh, the leading characters of
the Regency,— of the gilded, not the golden age !
The creation of DANDYISM — (pshaw not, ye critics !
nor exclaim “ hold, enough !” — for the thing is obsolete,
“ et il n'y a rien de nouveau que ce qui est oublié !");
the creation, I say of DANDYISM afforded the first indica-
tion to the public, that, in spite of Stultz and Truefitt,
the portraits of Sir Thomas and the certificates of Sir
Henry, the Prince was growing old !-Had we written
the word then, it must have been thus, — , or, at worst,
04d; for no one presumed to approach more definitely
that fatal hint. If, when Louis the Fourteenth attained
his seventieth year, his courtiers defined soixante et dix
ans as l'âge de tout le monde, no one at Carlton House now
presumed to be less than five-and-forty.
Nature, however, was no courtier. Nature began to
hint that liqueurs were an unsafer beverage than sherry,-
that jollity was a plebeian effervescence, — wit a more
princely thing than humour, — superciliousness than noise.

esses of George Brummel, as they now enlarge upon the
feats of Sir Robert Sale.
It is all stupid and silly enough in the retrospection ;
and Brummell is, at present, only known to history as an
adventurer who, after giving the law to princes, received it
from a Juge de paix, and died a lunatic in a public hos-
pital ; just as, fifteen years ago, Napoleon was an adven-
turer who, after giving the law to emperors, received it
from Sir Hudson Lowe, died of the worries at St. Helena !
But the re-action has commenced. Napoleon is begin-
ning to receive ample justice at the hands of a new gene-
ration ; and our grand-nephews will behold in George
Brummell a great reformer,-- a man who dared to be
cleanly in the dirtiest of times, — a man who compelled
gentlemen to quit the coach-box and assume a place in
their own carriage, - a man who induced the ingenuous
youth of Britain to prove their valour otherwise than by
threshing superannuated watchmen,-a man, in short,
who will survive for posterity as Charlemagne of the great
empire of Clubs. .
It would never surprise me to find the ashes of the
great ex-dandy fetched home from Caen, as those of
Napoleon from St. Helena, to be interred at the foot of the
Duke of York's column; on the identical spot where he
initiated the Prince into the mysteries of Roman punch;
the Sully of that modern Henri whose good-nature pro-
bably wished that all his subjects might have “ un turbot
au pot." No doubt that, like the great man of antiquity,
George Brummell often threatened his ungrateful country
that it “ should not even possess his bones!” But flesh
and blood are more susceptible in their generation, than
the disembodied and enlightened ghost.
So Seneca-" Corruptibile corpus aggravat animam ; et

monthly reviews before his eyes, he would have grown as
stiff and concise as a drill sergeant.
One word more, however, about the Brummell school!
If effeminate, conceited, frivolous, in their pursuit of
pleasure, they pursued it with less peril to His Majesty's
lieges than the rufflers of more recent times. Melton,
which owed its origin to their sportmanship, still attests
that they were good riders and good fellows, though they
smashed neither turnpike-gates nor policemen. They
drank their claret without forcing buckets of gin down
the throats of the swell-mob; and like certain insect
tribes which prey upon each other, their victims were
sought and found in their own order of society. It is
not always that the scum floating on the surface of a great
capital, is of so innoxious a nature. Theirs was the foam
of champagne, not the frothing of coculus indicus.
So much in honour of the circle into which I was that
night inducted at Carlton House! I conclude I passed
muster respectably in the throng ; for, after a whisper
with which his Royal Highness accompanied his cordial
reception of my mother, I saw Lady Ormington's eye
assume the self-same supernatural brightness that had
emanated from her lord's, on the day of Danby's debut in
public life.
I flatter myself my tie was irreproachable! It is not
every man who can wear a white waistcoat and cravat,
without looking either insipid as a boiled chicken, or
dingy as a Spanish olive. But for those qualified by
nature by clear complexions and well planted whiskers to
surmount the difficulty, nothing like it to mark the inborn
distinction between a gentleman and a butler ! - The
steward's room, and the Lord High Steward's room,
were just then assimilated in the fashion of their garments.
Tights and Tituses were the order of the day; and the
costume which the present reign has restored to the
English court, was the destinctive mark of a fine gentle-
man in the eyes of the finest gentleman in Europe. It
brings tears into my eyes to reflect how that last remnant
of the Chesterfield school has since been vilified. And
why? - because, of the mingled mud and spangles com-

posing the ground-work of a court, the succeeding genera-
tion preferred the mud.
CARLTON HOUSE (at the period of which I treat) had
not yet put on its judge's condemning cap. It was the
Carlton House of the Prince, not of the Regent;— it was
the Carlton House of the Whigs, not of the Tories ;-
the bivouac of the Opposition, not the tabernacle of Church
and State. - To me there was nothing very striking in its
aspect; for the same tastes, the same degenerate passion
for trinketry and Lilliputian virtù, encumbered its consoles
with china and its chimney-pieces with fanciful pendules,
that rendered my mother's drawing-room a Dædalian mys-
tery. Elegance, however, was there, though over-gauded
with superficial refinement. Even gold may be degraded
by super-gilding, or attenuated to too fine a thread.
At my age, it was impossible not to be excited by the
spectacle of a fête so brilliant in its arrangements, so remark-
able for the beauty of its female guests; and gay music
and glaring illumination produced their usual exhilarating
sensations, when the coup d'ail burst upon my view.
But such is the ordering of every human destiny, that,
after the Egyptian custom, the death's head, the refrige-
rating memento mori, was not wanting at the banquet.
Everybody was talking of my brother !-A new speaker
of importance is more estimated by the adverse party than
by his own. The Whigs were anxiously exclaiming,
“ Who is this young Danby ? — whose son, whose
scholar? — Eton or Harrow ? - Oxford or Cambridge ?--
Did he distinguish himself at the University ? — What
private tutor ? - what honours ? — what Club ? -"
Nay, when some dowager or damsel, smitten with the
whiteness of my linen or blackness of my curls, was at
the trouble of inquiring the name of the tall young man
leaning against the door, I had the torture of hearing it
answered, —“Don't you know ?-A younger brother of
the Danby by whom all the world is engrossed !"-
Ye gods!-to be accepted in society as supplementary
to John Danby ; - faire la queue de la comète to my
squinting elder brother ! — I was on the verge of learning
to despise conventional distinctions. The noble nature of

Emily had so far regenerated my own, that the True,-
the Real,- was acquiring some value in my eyes. But
now, all was over with my dawning virtues. The moment
I found my position subordinate, came the ambition of
rising. It was indispensable to my happiness not to be
pointed out much longer as the brother of the Honourable
Member for Rigmarole.
But how to distinguish myself, — how? — The first of
gladiators cannot conquer without a fight; and where,
alas ! was I to find an arena ? — Neither Bacon nor
Milton, Burleigh nor Bolingbroke, could have made them-
selves remarkable by “ a livery more guarded than their
fellows” as clerks in the Foreign Office. Nay, as men
of genius, they had been less serviceable in active life than
such men as Hanmer and Snatch, — as was exemplified by
Walpole, when he pointed out a blunt paper-knife as a
better instrument to divide the pages of a book, than a
sharper blade. In my official capacity, therefore, my
prospects of distinction were as remote as if lying on the
Oriental side of the Red Sea.
Even as regarded the lists of fashion, a Jack Harris
might distinguish himself, because, to a low-born man,
notoriety is fame. Whereas, for one of my position to
make himself remarked by dress or equipage, were defama-
tory as the branding iron !- The highest distinction for a
nobleman's younger son in such a clique as that at Carlton
House, is to become altogether undistinguishable. — Woe-
ful annihilation !- a drop in the ocean, -a grain of sand
in the wilderness !-
A sudden thought relieved my depressed spirits. What
if I were to marry Lady Harriet Vandeleur, set the Thames
on fire by our select dinners, and, like a hand at commerce,
win the game by my skill at discarding ? — A Cecil and
Lady Harriet Danby unanimous in their views and pro-
jects, able to command the best society, might per force of
tact become fuglemen of the brigade of fashion. Eight
thousand a year, though nothing in the hands of a gambler
like Morley, less than nothing in those of a Squeamy, or a
Sir Moulton Drewe, would become Pactolus, when flowing
through the fertilizing regions of a brain like mine.

“ After all,” I reasoned within myself, on my return
from the gorgeous fête, which had proved such a scene of
humiliation, " after all, but for that expedition to South-
ampton Buildings, I should have remained seriously
attached to the piquant little personage, whom Emily has
taught me to regard as a doll. It would be a very
small sacrifice on my part to become her husband. The
dozen years difference of age between us, must be estimated
at six hundred a year each, and the jointure makes all
equal. In affording me the means of shining in the beau
monde, she commands my gratitude, and will, eventually,
win my affection. Decidedly, I must set about recom-
mending myself to the little widow,-a new Jason,
devoted to the conquest of the golden fleece.”
Next night, came the Opera. I had already determined
to drop my visits to Emily ; though not so suddenly as to
cause an alarming vacuum in her existence. I would wean
her, poor girl, from my society. My visit to the box
should be a short one. On many accounts, indeed, this
was desirable ; for the d’Acunhas were beginning to under-
stand just so much English as rendered them bores. They
would be asking questions and misconceiving the answers ;
then further inquiries, with new misapprehensions.
From Emily, however, I had nothing to fear in the way
of questioning. She was happy enough to have me with
her, without indulging in frivolous curiosity ; nay, she had
no curiosity. With her I was secure from the vulgar gos-
sip that beset me in company with Lady Harriet; tittle-
tattle about births and marriages, promotions and prefer-
ments. So far from knowing who and who were together,
Emily Barnet knew not even who was whom. Had she
been my wife, this would have been a defect; in a friend,
a charming, intelligent, conversational friend, it was little
short of a virtue. Her mind was thoroughly unsophis-
ticated. She never read a newspaper, — never heard a
scandal. —
“I was at a magnificent ball last night," at Carlton
House,” said I, by way of reply to Emily's remarks on
my air of langour.
" What is Carlton House, - a theatre ? ” inquired she,

with a naïveté that must have passed for assumed, with
any one to whom the peculiarities of her situation were
unknown.
“No, — the residence of the heir apparent, — the
Prince of Wales.”
“ The Prince of Wales ? --I have heard Mr. Hanmer
speak of him as a paragon!” said she, “ He is young and
handsome, is he not?”-
“ Twenty years ago, he was indeed a paragon, — as
charming as his last night's fête” — Never, never, did I
pass an evening so enchanting,” cried I, with affected
enthusiasm.
A heavy sigh must have escaped poor Emily ; for
d'Acunha immediately turned his sallow saturnine visage
round upon us, as if to examine what was going on.
One of the most bewitching charms of Emily Barnet
consisted in a throat long and slender as that of Anna Bo-
leyn, which imparted a peculiar grace to her movements.
It was impossible to see her under greater disadvantage
than I did ; - always in the same place, — always in the
same dress, — always in the same attitude ; — no scope
for the display of elegance of manners, or accomplishments
of mind.
Yet strange to tell, there was something in all this that
seemed to enhance the charm of our intercourse. That
dull silent box, with its solemn atmosphere of reserve, -
the mourning habits of its inmates, – the peculiarities of
their looks and language, - imparted an almost monastic
gravity to the spot, contrasted with the brilliancy of my
usual haunts, and the garrulity of my ordinary companions.
I felt as if under the influence of a spell the moment I
crossed the threshold. It was like stepping into some
picture by Velasquez. It was like creeping into the heart
of some old Spanish romance.
But I was going to remark that I had noticed in Emily,
among the few expressive gestures compatible with her
invariable position, a peculiar mode of turning away her
head, on pretence of looking towards the stage, between
the wall and the intervening figure of Madame d'Acunha,
whenever the discrepancy of our situations in life became

demonstrated by some incidental topic. There was a
deprecation in her desire to avoid my scrutiny at such
moments, which, .even had not the movement itself been
exquisitely graceful, would have touched my feelings.
Never did she seem so lovely in my eyes as then, — with
nothing of her features visible but the fine oval of her soft
cheek and dimpled chin, - fair as monumental alabaster,
and rendered still fairer by contrast with the glossy
curls hanging loosely from her temples. In that attitude
does she recur oftenest to my memory. I seem to see her
still, — averting her moistened eyes, and by slow degrees
returning to her usual position; the long upturned eye-
lashes first becoming visible, — then, the arched lips, —
the finely chiselled nose, — all that pure and noble phy-
siognomy. - Poor, poor Emily! —
She detested England, - how should she do otherwise ?
- and all her pleasurable anticipations regarded her re-
turn to Portugal. Her lamentations incessantly recalled,
like Mignon's song,
das Land wo die citronen blühn!
Her visions were of silvery fountains and azure skies, of
evergreen shrubberies and craggy mountains, of music and
song, not as pleasing imagery, or mere accessories, but
essentially interwoven with the business of life. So strong
is the influence of early associations !-
“She cannot have formed projects in which we are
mutually interested,” said I to myself, in an apologetic tone,
as I slowly descended into the nether world from d'Acunha's
box on the night in question. “She cannot suppose, poor
girl, that there is anything in common between the son of
an English peer and the daughter of a Lisbon merchant,
between a Downing-street diplomat, and the ward of a
snuffy old solicitor in Southampton Buildings ! She can-
not imagine when raving about the groves and skies of
Cintra, that I am ever likely to wander by her side among
its froggy tanks and twisted-stemmed pomegranate trees !
- Emily must be aware that I lounge away a pleasant
hour with her, glad to refresh my eyes with her bright
intelligent countenance, and as little serious in my atten-
tions as she in her encouragement. She likes me, because

I am a litile younger and more amusing than old Hanmer
or d'Acunha ; but would infinitely prefer some young
Oporto winegrower of her own condition of life, to a mere
idler about town like Cecil Danby.”—
I said this to myself, dear readers, (ambitious plural !)
with, of course, a secret conviction that Emily would be
proud and happy to perform for my sake a barefoot pil-
grimage to the shrine of Saint James of Compostella. But
it was as well to keep up the farce with myself of desert-
ing her with the most honourable intentions. After having
pressed her hand every time I placed her in her hackney-
coach, and brought her a sprig of some favourite flower
every time we met, I made up my mind to back out of the
business with a cereinonious decorum worthy the king's
champion at a coronation banquet!
I had quitted the box the moment I saw old d’Acunha
wipe his opera-glass, preparatory to placing it in its morocco
case; which was always the signal for their preparing to
quit the house. Heretofore I had seized that moment to
nail myself to my chair; the happiness of my evening
consisting in my transit from the clouds to the earth below,
with Emily leaning on my arm ; her fragrant hair occa-
sionally wafted across my cheek by the night air of the
passages, — her breath almost mingling with my own.
But with my present views, it was high time this should
have an end. So I walked quietly out of the box, as if
intending to return; and instead of returning, went straight
down to Lady Harriet, and (thanks to the ample themes
supplied by the fête of the preceding night,) found occasion
to be extraordinarily amusing.
A mere woman of the world must be very generous
indeed, who does not allow herself to be diverted at the
expense of her friends ; who, she is well aware, would feel
little scruple in returning the compliment. The Mar-
chioness of Devereux, wearied by her ball, was not at the
Opera. Nothing easier, therefore, than to describe to Lady
Harriet the strip of plush on which her fair friend had
mounted her diamond bandeau the preceding night, like
the new order of a new Countess of Salisbury.
A peal of laughter from her ladyship and Lord Squeamy,

who sat gibbering in the corner of the box, rewarded my
sally. I next attacked the Duchess of Moneymusk, who,
I declared, had wanted only a philabeg at the Prince's
ball, to look the image of a Highland recruiting serjeant.
Again, Lady Harriet's laughter exploded: but I noticed
that certain persons or personages who had been chattering
away in the next box, became suddenly silent, and had
little doubt that her grace and her grace's Scotch bonnet
were seated there in judgment upon my perfidy.
As it was my cue to take out Lady Harriet, and make
an exhibition of our intimacy in the crush-room, I re-
mained till the end of the ballet. The people of the
adjoining box were just before us in the lobby, — quizzes,
decided quizzes ! -- an old woman, escorted by an ungainly
looking chap with his hat on, and a simple-looking country
miss. I was struck, however, even in the midst of my
whispers to Lady Harriet, by the singularly melodious
voice of the girl. She possessed exactly the same varied
and refined intonation which had imparted double elo-
quence to the speech of the Honourable Member for Rig-
marole! And no wonder ; — for, on her turning round,
evidently shocked by one of Lady Harriet's explosive
laughs, exclamations were exchanged between us of
6 Cecil !”“Julia !” — and I found that I had been fol-
lowing in the wake of my maiden sister and maiden aunt !
“ I hope you received my card? – I did myself the
honour of calling yesterday. - By the way, I had no card,
and simply left my name," said I, addressing Miss Danby,
sen. But with a sort of negative grunt, plainly implying
she did not believe a word I was saying, the dear soul and
her Bayard in the brown beaver hat passed onwards.
Julia, however, lingered a little behind, in conversation
with Lady Harriet, whom she had known as a child, in
Hanover Square ; and I was startled by the singular sweet-
ness of her countenance. It was a face such as Raphael
or Titian would have delighted to paint; the earnest ex-
pression of the eye and angelic character of the mouth,
being exactly such as the old artists used to lend to the
celestial beings, whose hair bordered on auburn as the
natural accompaniment of a transparent complexion.

More wonders !—The frightful sister was grown a
beauty, just as the stupid brother had progressed into a
genius! - The cockade was decidedly eclipsed. - What

a clerk in a public office, –and desperately in love with
a young lady of problematical extraction, domiciled in the

I wonder why people are so fond of calling Youth “inge-
nuous ? -" No greater mistake ! - Youth has not courage
to tell the truth, even to itself. As I said before, it is
only after thirty that men presume to have a will or a way
of their own.
Youth is an imitative animal ;-Youth is a monkey!-
The world is in conspiracy against it. The beasts of prey
have the best of it. The monkey is condemned to a chain
and a bag of nuts. Were the marmozet to wax grave, we
should cry,“ Stupid little beast, look at its airs of gravity!
Give it a poke with your stick, and make it climb.”—The
poor monkey is accordingly forced to be frisky, whether it
will or no. — It dare not be natural: it dare not trust its
instincts.
But Youth has another and still bitterer enemy than its
masters, - ITSELF! Of all the mockeries it has to dread,
those most fatal in the creation of mistrust are its own.

vouchsafed by nature. But the curious in casuistry are
requested to decide whether, of the spirits of good and evil
assigned to each of us as our companions through life, the
good have not the ascendancy over our material, and the
evil over our moral nature ! - The flush of joy, the thrill
of horror, so instinctive in our early years, at the relation
of wicked or virtuous actions, — the gushing tears, or
uncontrollable smiles, evincing our sympathies of affection,
are far more independent of our will than we care to own ;
whereas, most of our evil deeds are the result of delibera-
tion. But, here we are, on the brink of the bottomless
pit of metaphysics ; and there are coxcombs enough in
that transcendental department of the fudgerations of
literature, without mustering among their number the
Honourable Cecil Danby. My Pegasus is entered for
higher stakes.
I only mean to say, - for the longest preamble must
arrive at the fact at last, — that though I suspected myself
of being desperately in love with Emily Barnet, whenever
I tried to bring myself to confession, I deceived myself and
the truth was not in me.
At my shaving-glass, (tonsorial operations being pecu-
liarly favourable to reflection, nay, I am not sure that
beards were not assigned by Providence to secure to every
man five minutes' uninterrupted communing with himself
in the course of the day) — at my shaving-glass, I often
interrogated my feelings; and whenever, by a rising blush
or gentle sigh they suggested that Emily had claims on my
affections, I pished and pshawed them into a more reason-
able frame, as though I were old Munden enacting a
peevish guardian in a Spanish comedy.
I said to myself, “ Emily is a handsome girl enough,”
(my conscience whispering all the time that she was an
angel !) " but every girl who smiles upon one, at my age,
appears a divinity,” I said to myself, “It is true that,
niched into that wretched opera-box, Emily's manners
appear tolerable," (my conscience whispering all the time
that they would have done honour to a court !) “ but,
launched in good society, her deportment would probably
be as awkward and unmeaning as that of other misses.”

I said to myself, “ Certainly, her mind appears cultivated.
She has read a parcel of foreign books, that I know nothing
about," (my conscience whispering all the time, that the
originality of her ideas was only exceeded by the depth of
her acquirements !) “but it would be a bore to produce in
good company a wife who seems to have been educated for
a governess.”
But this was not all. Bitter as were these treasons
against Emily, I poured into the porches of my own ears
a still more leprous distilment to injure the gifted being I
was intent upon depreciating!
“ After all,” said Cecil Danby to me, (flourishing one of
Packwood's razors gracefully in his hand, — and he deserved
to cut his throat for his pains, —) “after all, who will
guarantee me that this girl is not an adventuress ? - How
do I know that the whole affair has not been a trap to
ensnare me? - What assures me that old Hanmer, warned
of my coming, did not station his pretty ward (perhaps
some illegitimate offspring of the prim old solicitor !) in his
drawing room, as a torch to singe the wings of the fashion-
able butterfly ? - Lord Ormington's younger son may be
a bad match for one of the daughters of the Duchess of
Moneymusk, or even for Lady Harriet Vandeleur ; but I
flatter myself that, with my person and prospects, I am
a catch for a Miss Emily Barnet. As if those mum-chance,
olive-faced d'Acunhas would have allowed me to sit there
by her side, looking unutterable things and saying unlook-
able things, without apprizing her guardian ! — If they did
. pot, they are unconscientious, disreputable people ; adven-
po turers, also. — I am, however, the last man to be made a
dupe of; and now that I espy the plot, will be cautious of
throwing myself in the way of temptation.”
Such was the “ ingenuousness” of my “youth :" and I
will answer for it that few of those who “explore Cam's
smooth margin," or the banks of the Cherwell or Isis, after
being flogged through Eton, Harrow, Westminster, or
Winchester,--Horace, Homer, and the Greek Testament,
are worth a maravedi more than myself in point of single-
ness of mind.
On the present occasion, Cecil Danby kept his word

with me like a gentleman. Next Opera night, not a sign
of him in the d’Acunhas' box!I even eschewed the pit,
lest the old Guimaraen plumb should adhere to me, and
invite me to accompany me up stairs. This manouvre
had the effect of bringing Emily, during the ballet, to the
front of the box, where she had never made her appearance
since the first disastrous night of our meeting. I could
plainly see her eyes wandering over the pit in search of
me. Nay, as if I were not sufficiently distinguished from
the mass to be perceptible to the naked eye, she had even
recourse to old d'Acunha's glasses, which, Heaven knows,
I had never seen her use before !-
All this was in my favour. - For I was of course installed
“ close at the ear of Eve," - close beside Lady Harriet
Vandeleur ; - and my cause with her was not injured
by the attention universally excited by Emily's beauty.
· People raved about her ; - for she was both a beauty and
a mystery. Had one of the Duchess of Moneymusk's
daughters been thrice as handsome, the world would have
said less about her; as a planet, whose rising and setting
might be computed, whose aphelion and perihelion were
matters for the almanack.
But Emily was a brilliant meteor, known only by its
radiance. All the world — that is, all the fashionable
world, — knew her by the name of “ Cis Danby's girl.”
I was the only man admitted into her box; the only per-
son .ever seen to address her; and a vague report was
prevalent (spread, doubtless, by the vulgar horde who had
dodged us home in the hackney-coach,) that she lived in:
an obscure street in the neighbourhood of Bloomsbury
Square. Was it my fault that the world should form
indiscreet surmises from such grounds ? -
The consequence was, that no one presumed to name
her disrespectfully before me, any more than they would
have done my sister. Though canvassed far and near as
the handsomest creature in town, before me she was never
mentioned. While talking that night to Lady Harriet,
I saw her ladyship's eyes frequently directed towards the
altitude where Emily's graceful head detached itself from
the red curtain of her box, as by a halo. I could see that
I 2

she was proud to have me with her, - proud to render me
faithless to so lovely a creature ; -- no, not proud ! pride
is a loftier feeling — she was vain ; - vain that the bat-
talion of fops surveying her box from the pit, should
whisper to each other, “ Aha! - Cis has changed hands
to-night!-Cis has forsworn the company of the gods !-
Cis has come down to the things of this world.”—
Cis had forsworn the company of the gods ; but if Jove
in his amorous de-deification disguised himself as a swan,
the modern thunderer was proving himself a goose.
“1 am quite anxious about Lady Ormington! ” ob-
served Lady Harriet, suddenly addressing me, when she
saw that my eyes were following the direction of her own.
“ She is growing ill and nervous again. I tried to get her
to the Opera to-night; but she would not hear of it. I
have not seen her so poorly these two years.”
I hazarded certain filial allusions to the heat of the
weather : not, however, because blind to the fact that
Lady Ormington's illness was pre-ordained so long as Julia
remained in town.
I wanted her to go with me to our water-party on
Monday,” added Lady Harriet coolly.
" To a water-party ? —” said I, satisfied that this was
only a lure thrown out to make me petition for an invita-
tion, and choosing to be cruel. “ You might as well
propose such a recreation to a Frenchwoman, the most
hydrophobic of God's creatures ; or to Lot's wife, after
her transformation.”
“ You are extremely witty to-night !” retorted Lady
Harriet, drily — very drily. —
“My mother is one of the many English women who
so band-box away their days as to lose, like Baron Trenck,
or Latude, or any other state-prisoner, all capacity for air
and exercise. In her youth, things so pretty were not
made to stand !” I continued, - forgetting that the page
of the register recording my mother's baptism, might
almost include that of Lady Harriet.
• There will be no walking, and very little standing in
our expedition,” she replied. “ However, perhaps she
was right to declare off, for your brother and sister are
of the party."

“ Lady Ormington must feel proud of the miracles
wrought by her son's success !” said I, bitterly. “ Danby's
parliamentary triumphs seem able, like faith, to remove
mountains : for I remember once your telling me you had
given up an engagement in Hanover Square, on finding he
was to dine at home, - having no courage to confront a
squinting man !”
" Mr. Danby has proved that he is worth listening to ;
and where that is the case, looks go for nothing. I then
thought he was to make his way with us, like yourself, by
superficial accomplishments. But who cares for the figure-
head of a ship which, charged with a precious freight, is
cutting its way bravely through the waters ?"
“ If we had but Gurney here to take you down !-"
cried I, with the most supercilious impertinence. “ Do
you know, dearest Lady Harriet, you would make a dan-
gerous rival for Hafiz, or Rosa Matilda of the Morning
Post! ”
“ While Cecil Danby is to be rivalled only by the
ineffable Cecil Danby !” — said she, with perfect coolness ;
“ Crispin, rival de lui-même!”
I was cruelly nettled: not by her sayings, but by her
doings. What in the world had induced her to form this
offensive and defensive alliance with my brother ? - Could
John — frightful John, — be superseding Colonel Morley,
absent without leave? – Her invitation to Julia was a
natural consequence ; for it was well known in the Orming-
ton clique, that Danby was nowhere so vulnerable as
through his affection for his sister ; that those twain were
as one flesh. But why desire to conquer him ? His
prospects were too good to admit of his marrying for
money; and in the way of mere flirtation, what woman
ever threw away her smiles upon a cub, because he had
made a tolerable speech or two in the House ? — Yet now
I recollect — but, no ! – there is no call upon me to reveal
those secrets of my times, in which I did not exercise a
personal influence.
What right had I, meanwhile, to resent being excluded
from Lady Harriet's water-party, when from her last al
fresco entertainment I had been self-banished ? I saw
13

clearly that she had not forgotten Richmond, because I
was beginning to forget Southampton Buildings; but chose
that I should crawl my way, with other creeping things,
into her ark. Her ladyship was mistaken.
" It is a pity you do not persuade Lord Ormington to
join your party! -" said I. “ It would then include,
to the last fraction, the most high and puissant house of
Danby.”
“ Not exactly to the last," — observed her ladyship,
evidently preparing me a coup de patte.
“And what particle, pray, would be wanting?”
“ The greatest, in his own estimation,” she replied,
bitterly. But I managed to look so hopelessly puzzled,
that she was compelled explicitly to add,—“yourself !”
“I am a nonentity !-” cried I, laughing, as if relieved
from my perplexity. “Besides, all the world has heard
of our Greenwich dinner on Monday, which is to include
all the birds of the heir (apparent) and all the fishes of the
Thames ! "
Lady Harriet saw that her coup had missed fire. Unin-
cluded in the clique of Carlton House, she fancied that
some party was in petto of which she knew nothing ; and
was piqued like a pouting child, who discovers that there
is a doll in the world larger than its own.
"We dine at Colonel Morley's villa, at Fulham,” said
she. “ I have not courage for the compound of villanous
smells, punch, tobacco and small beer, which infect one
after a dinner at the Ship.”
• The Ship? —” said I, opening my innocent eyes with
wonder.
“ Did you not say you were going to dine at the
Ship?” —
"I mentioned Greenwich. Your ladyship, I perceive,
concentrates that nautical town into a fashionable tavern,
just as people consider the Pavilion, Brighton, and Paris,
France ! If the tribe of Danby collected round you at
Fulham on Monday, are charitable enough to send us their
good wishes floating with the return of the tide, I trust
they will find me less publicly installed.”
“I am aware that you are fond of secluded retreats !_”

observed Lady Harriet, piquée au vif, and raising her
opera-glass towards the d’Acunhas' box.
But I would not be brow-beaten. If once a keeper
allows himself to be glared down by the animal he is bent
on taming, there is an end of him.
- Admit,” cried I, gently caressing my curls, “ that
there is some pleasure in straying from the beaten track,
the vulgar, dusty, turnpike-road of fashionable life, - to
luxuriate among “ hedge-row elms and hillocks green,”-
youth, beauty, innocence and delight !-One is apt to
grow Paradisaical at the rural season ; when the worn-out
things of this world seem fit only for the curiosity shop.
Buds and blossoms, hay-making and love-making, go
charmingly together, with the season at 78, and the reason
at zero."
“I quite agree with you," — replied Lady Harriet, too
much a woman of the world to be thrown off her guard,
even by this coarse attack, “ when the haymakers are
genuine Philly Nettletops, and the love newly mown like
the grass. But the bergères galantes of Boucher, with
their powdered wigs and hoops of pea-green taffeta, or
worse still, the glazed calico shepherds and shepherdesses
of a London ballet, are to me as tawdry as all other coun-
terfeits. By the way, can you tell me the name of the
illustrious unknown yonder, who seems to be watching us
with so much interest ? ” —
I did not expect that Lady Harriet would come so
decidedly to the point.
" That beautiful creature in mourning ? -" said I, with
quickened respiration. “A Portuguese I fancy. The
gentleman at least, is a certain Don Vicente d’Acunha. —
Perhaps you are acquainted with him ? — It is amazing the
number of refugees from Spain and Portugal now in
London. The other night at Carlton House, we had the
Duchess d'Hijar, the finest figure in Europe.

party !” cried I, scarcely able to control my irritation;
“ who is more intimate than myself in the house where I
had first the honour of meeting the beautiful girl who
appears so powerfully to excite your ladyship’s interest.-
Drewe, my dear fellow !- why have you never sent the
recipe you promised me, for cleaning meerschaums ?-
Though I sentenced my boy to a week's apprenticeship in
the barracks of the Gerinan Legion, Hudson assures me
the fellow has no more idea of handling a pipe, than I of
hingeing a Laurencekirk !”.
As I anticipated, Sir Moulton Drewe, who had never
heard a word of the recipe, and did not even smoke, was
so voluble in giving and requiring explanations, that Emily
was safe! Before he had half recovered his astonishment,
I was in the centre of the pit, squabbling with one of the
Stanhopes about the comparative merits of Vestris and
Deshayes.
I begin to think there is a destiny in the said Opera,
(King's Theatre - Queen's Theatre, — what is it, just
now? —) for embroiling the affairs of bankers, managers,
and lovers ! - One of the cleverest fellows connected with
its harassing concerns, has often protested to me that the
London public would never enjoy a good opera, till the
present crazy barrack was burnt to the ground; and I am
of his opinion. Fire is a universal purification. Perhaps,
by the time the new houses of Parliament have risen, like
blanched sea-kail from their cinders, the Fire-King of
whom James and Horace Smith made themselves the
laureats, may take to his embraces the great barn in the
Haymarket, which, on the night in question, I devoted to
him and all other Infernal Gods ! -
Yet, after all, there is something sacred and classical in
the old den !—The Opera House is pretty nearly the
only place of public amusement of the Prince's time, left
standing. Carlton House, Ranelagh, Lords, Commons,
Whitfield's Chapel, Vauxhall, Fozard's Riding School, the
Argyll Rooms, and the King's Mews, - all evaporated,
all flown off in fumo! This is the age of demolition, -
the era of rubbish. The very nature of London buildings
interdicts a pretension to the venerable ; for the moss of

antiquity imparts no dignity to brick and mortar. “Nothing
more deplorable than the decay of a plaster wall !” says a
clever French writer. “Like a gauze dress it is a thing
not intended for durability, which, when it lasts, becomes
a badge of poverty disgrace.”
At all events, when the edifice which has drained the
resources of bankers, taxed the wisdom of lord chancellors,
and enriched the Gazette with nearly as many respectable
names as the battle of Waterloo, shall down with its
dust, like the wretched capitalists whom it has involved
in ruin, may some appropriate historian arise to immor.
talize its archives! When those charming boxes shall
have ceased to exist, whose six-feet-square are enjoyed
for sixty evenings of the year, at the cost of little more
than the salary of an Irish Bishop; when those stalls
shall be broken up, which, like that of Caligula's horse,
are .plated with gold, — may some Antoine Hamilton or
Callot of the twentieth century, dip his light pen in
aqua-fortis, to depict the lights and shadows of a spot
consecrated by such memories of beauty and genius, —
art and nature ; – human nature, of course, the only
nature worth writing of.
There was a time, — ere poets, like the gods of poetry,
had departed, - when the Pastoral had still its votaries,
and kings wandered amid happy valleys and wedded with
shepherdesses. The world knows better now-a-days. The
Pastoral has no longer a devotee, save in one of Haydn's
symphonies; and kings abide in castles on the Thames,
or palaces on the Seine, guarded by a legion of honour
and legion of cooks, - chefs d'escadrons and chefs de
cuisine ; — the only shepherdesses in whom they now take
delight, being of biscuit or Dresden china, standing prim
and crisp upon their chimney-pieces.
But the amiable weakness of modern times that
approaches nearest to the hallucinations under whose
influence “ King Cophetua wooed the beggar-maid,” is the
passion of a lord for an opera-dancer! An opera_dancer
is the Perdita of the nineteenth century, and the Crock-
fordites are her Florizels.
Some denizen of St. James's Street proposed to extend

the constitution of the country into King, Lords, Com-
mons, and Opera, — and why not? - The choregraphic
art is the nearest approach to a universal language, - that
desideratum of sages and centuries !-How else can we
account for the mightiness of renown which has bruited the
name of Taglioni from Indus to the Pole, enabling her to
subdue the Hyrcanian bear of St. Petersburg, and flourish
in the court-circular of the Celestial Empire ? - What
statesman, what philosopher, what elder among the conscript
fathers of art, science, or jurisprudence, has attained an
European, American, Asiatic, and African reputation, like
Fanny Elssler ? - Which would England, which would
Europe, most deplore, — the final exit of the Lord Chan-
cellor or of Taglioni ? - By Terpsichore and all her
caperings ! the ceremony approaching nearest the apo-
theosis of the ancients, is the crowning of a popular opera-
dancer !-
I know not how I find courage for pleasantries upon the
subject, -- unless as More and Anne Boleyn jested upon
the scaffold. For of all the adventures of my youth, that
which commenced on the stair-case at the Opera, has left
the most indelible impressions on my mind. The evil
issue thereof had its origin in the indiscretion of speech
wrung from me, on the night in question, by the tauntings
of Lady Harriet Vandeleur !
The following day I was to dine with Lord Votefilch,
who had a villa on the Thames to refresh himself one
day in the week by contact with the mud of nature,
after immersion the remaining six in its clay. It was
an ex-official dinner, or I should not have been invited.
Lord Votefilch the minister, lived in St. James's Square,
and gave dinners on Saturdays; Lord Votefilch the man,
at. Putney, and gave dinners on Sundays. I had rather
have belonged to the Saturday pow wow ; for Votefilch
the minister, was a great man in the political circle ;
whereas Votefilch the man, was a mere mediocrity among
the Watierians and their kind.
Besides, (as Chippenham and I agreed when he invited
us in an unceremonious way at the office,) it is adding
insult to injury for a chef to invite his youngsters to a

family dinner, which he knows they dare not refuse. I
wonder he did not beg us to bring our fishing-rods, like
other clerks out for a holiday! Even then, we could not
have allowed ourselves to feel affronted.
To dine at Putney at half past six, then the general
hour, necessitated a toilet at five; and I consequently
looked in for a moment, en passant, to Lady Orming-
ton's drawing-room, at an hour at which I was little in
the habit of testifying my filial respect. My mother used
to receive tribes of visitors on a Sunday. Fine ladies often
do, as the consequence of their retreat from the mobs let
loose upon the earth on that day of general debondagement.
Kensington Gardens was, if I recollect, just then the
resort in fashion. Kensington Gardens, (a spot which
oppresses my spirits as if the atmosphere confined within
its masses of trees were mephitic as the jungles of Sierra
Leone,) has undergone fierce alternations of popular favour
and scorn. It is sure to be either so much in fashion and
so crowded, that every blade of grass is worn from its
sooty turf; or so deserted, that the palace looks ashamed
to be standing there by itself, faisant pied de grue like a
pelican in the wilderness. At the period I write of, Bow
Street runners used to be stationed at the gate, to prevent
his Majesty's lieges from being mummied in their attempt
to pass the wicket. - No! that was the preceding year!--
At present there was nobody in Kensington Gardens but
the gate-keepers in their suits of green and yellow melan-
choly.-It was to the ring that the idlers devoted their
gravel-grinding.
Lady Ormington and Co. consequently remained in their
several habitations, sealed up like patent medicines.
I had forgotten however that, in her dread of family
dinners, it was her ladyship’s cue to be nervous ; and that
she was consequently “not at home ;" so that it startled
me when, on entering her china warehouse, instead of the
murmur of voices usual at that hour under its fresco
ceilings of blue sky, (a hateful fashion of that day, con-
veying the bitterest irony upon the dingy heavens without,)
I heard nothing but the peevish voice of Lady Ormington
talking to herself or Bibiche, – in notes that might have

been mistaken for those of a sick parrot, quarrelling with
itself over an almond.
Poor Bibiche ! – I should have been sorry for the little
beast, had not the adage of “ tel maître tel chien,” been
strictly exemplified in her case. A legitimate descendant
of the original Dash staring its unmeaning eyes out in
Cosway's portrait of the Right Honourable Lady Orming-
ton, Bibiche was whimsical, fretful, and unattached. I
was never sorry when my mother worried the dog ; for
the dog had an immunity for worrying all my mother's
fellow-creatures.
On the present occasion, however, it was not the spaniel
to whom her ladyship was murmuring her woes. It was
an animal of more consequence. It was the heir of the
noble House of Danby.
Saul among the prophets ! - What on earth could the
rising young man be about in the sanctuary of Bibiche
and her lady? I should as soon have expected to find old
Droneby himself inaugurated among the bonzes and man-
darins at Carlton House!
Lady Ormington was evidently agitated. Her face,
when flurried, had a peculiarly ridiculous appearance, like
the marble basin of a flower-garden, when ruffled by a
stormy wind, — which I take to be the wire-wove edition
of a puddle in a storm.
The Hon. Member for Rigmarole, who was standing up
before the fireless fire-place, as Englishmen are apt to do,
(as one sees a sentinel still on guard over poor dismantled
Kew Palace,) looked as cool as if he had been iced. A
lucky presentiment forewarned me not to nod to him, as
usual; for a moment afterwards, I was honoured by him
with a Grandisonian bow,- one of those bows for which
one hears the foot slide formally on the carpet! - The
honourable member saluted me as he would have done old
Votefilch ; and the salutation which, addressed to the
minister, had denoted humility, when addressed to the
clerk of the F.O. was, of course, an impertinence,
The colour rose to my cheek.- Not the flush of anger;

parts of speech, he had left the room.

“ A pretty business you have made of it!" whimpered
my mother, as soon as he was out of hearing.
“ Business ? - 1 guilty of business ? "- cried I, trying

Fie!” -
" Don't be absurd, Cis. I am quite nervous enough,
without your silly jokes. I tell you, you have irretriev-
ably offended your brother !”

affronted, which would have given me the very unnecessary

of committing matrimony-"

angrily. “ Your position is a most precarious one! -
Take warning! - Take heed! - If Danby were to make
representations to your father of the injury he has sustained
at your hands ”.
" Why what in Heaven's name have I done to him?-
I cheered his speech till it cost me my month's allowance
at Gunter's for Florence-drops, to cure my hoarseness !-
I may have said, perhaps, that he dressed like a gentleman

ries, or any other of my brother clerks, were to require a
bow from me in Pall Mall, buried to the ears in such a
coat as Danby's ".

energy than I had ever seen her exhibit. “Had your
brother addressed to his father, instead of myself, his
grievances against you —

“ He has been complaining, then ? - " cried I. « The
pretty boy has been here, with his finger in his eye,
declaring that unless I beg his pardon for having torn his
kite --
“ Do not FORCE me to bring you to reason !” cried my
mother, with so sudden an assumption of authority, that I
sat down quietly in a chair, prepared to listen patiently to
her expostulations. “With all your pretensions to good
manners and good sense, Danby has shown, on this occa-
sion, far more than yourself. He came here simply to
appeal to me, as your best friend, -as your only friend,
to engage you to observe towards him the same forbearance
and reserve he maintains towards you. It is his wish,
his engagement, indeed, with me, that you shall meet in
public as friends; and maintain towards each other, in
private, the mutual deference of elder and younger
brothers.”
“ And pray, in what point of this extraordinary com-
pact have I failed ?”— cried I, a sudden and terrible light
breaking in upon me,- a light which I own I wanted
courage to humiliate her and myself, by bringing to
distinct admission.
“ You have injured his reputation,-you have wounded
his feelings !” — persisted my mother. “ Do you suppose
that everybody is as indifferent to good repute as yourself?
-Do you imagine that because your heart is unsusceptible
of attachment ”
« Come, come, mother ! — If you are going to set up
John Danby in the pattern young man line, I must really
beg you to let me off !” cried I; “ I dine at Putney -"
« With Lord Votefilch ? - How unfortunate ! - You
will meet your brother !” —
“ Unfortunate, indeed !-I have a great mind to break
my leg, and send an excuse. Meanwhile,” said I, “ try
to make me understand, in as few words as possible, where
I injured the poor fellow's reputation, and how I have
wounded his feelings ? -"
“ By representing him, last night, in Lady Harriet
Vandeleur's box at the Opera, as sharing your dissipations.

“ Nonsense, nonsense ! -I merely silenced Lady Har-

peating things ! Between jest and earnest, she attacked
your brother about it in the crush-room, with Lady Susan

attention."
“ Danby ? — to Lady Susan Theydon ? - one of the
prettiest girls in town!”
“ You will probably find her Lady Susan Danby before
the season is over; that is, if he manages to get over with
her mother, (who is the most particular woman alive,)

allusions.”

I, in all sincerity ; “ for 1 can understand that, under
such circumstances, he may have felt vexed by what was

explanation, without all these petticoat negotiations ? "-
“ Because he is under a promise to me never to enter
into disputes with you of any kind !”
I shrugged my shoulders.

Ormington. “ But not a word more, Cecil! I have

feeling in your composition, to make the necessary repa-

I was about to utter a bitter rejoinder ; when the butler
hastily announced that Lord Chippenham, who was to
drive me down to Putney, was waiting at the door.

CHAPTER VIII.
The proprietors are bitten by the rage of what they fancy to be improve-
ment, and are levelling ground, smoothing banks, and building rockwork,
with pagodas and Chinese railing. The laburnums, willows, and flowering
shrubs are beginning to be tortured into what the gardener calls genteel
shapes. Even the course of the river has been thwarted, and part of its waters
diverted into a broad ditch to form an island,- flat, swampy, and dotted over
with exotic shrubs.

ENGLAND is thought to excel in villas. A villa is an
architectural fantasia, wherein every individual is allowed
to display his taste or want of taste; and the Dublin cit,
accordingly, places his portico on the second floor, over the
verandah: the Parisian badaud ornaments the sphinxes
over his gates with coquettish straw hats, tied knowingly
under the chin ; and in Holland, rows of tin aloes in stone
vases are ranged along the wall. But in the environs of

(
London, ye gods ! in the environs of London, from Brent-
ford to Stratford le Bow, from Paddington to Putney,
what vagaries in brick and mortar, - what barbarisms in
Portland stone !-
In all directions, for ten miles round the capital, -
villas — villas — villas! A villa is one of the first indica-
sions of prosperity on the part of a professional man.
Thriving merchants — popular actors — popular dentists
popular lawyers — popular all sorts of things, are sure to
have their Tusculum, their rus in urbe, their Eden, their
’appiness 'ouse! — A villa is the agrément of a laborious
life, the restoration of an unwholesome one ; and the days
of many a cabinet minister have been lengthened in the
land by the bel respiro of his Gloucester Lodge or Foots-
cray, his Ealing or Hayes.
But, above all, a villa is an essentially aristocratic appur-
tenance. Lords and ladies cannot dispense with a green
and sunny nook, in which to go and hide their heads when
they are glad or sorry, in the sweets of a honey-moon or
sours of widowerhood.
· Among these, there are doubtless a few such as
youthſul poets fancy, when they love.
There is Chiswick, matchless Chiswick ! - There is
Strawberry Hill, somewhat the worse for wear, but classic
ground, every inch of it ; - Gunnersbury, where the
flowers and fruit are formed, like those of Aladdin's magic
garden, of rubies and emeralds ; – Sion, Wimbledon,
Mount Felix, Ken Wood, Osterley. Where conclude, if
once we venture to begin, the enumeration of our suburban
residences of high degree ? —
In point of truth, the excellence we claim for the villas
of London resides less in their site, than in the intensity
of verdure engendered by our ever-weeping climate.
Their real attraction consists in the soft, green turf, over-
shaded here and there by a clump of beeches, a shapely
tulip-tree or drooping cedar; skirted at intervals by
parterres of geraniums, or creepers trained in fanciful
devices, throwing themselves like fountains of blossoms
into the air ; — while clumps of the choicer shrubs, all-
spice trees, magnolias, or the gum cistus, exhale their

musky perfumes, like Moorish slaves flinging their censers of
incense to and fro. (If that be not a bran-new simile, O
Public! I am pretty particularly mistaken !)
I speak all this feelingly, for one of the favourite subjects
of my mother's grumbleations was the want of a villa.
Ormington Hall was in Lancashire, a two days', nay, for a
nervous lady, a three days' journey from town. What was
to become of her at Easter and Whitsuntide ? - What
was she to do, during family mournings or other plaintive
exigencies ? — Her sole resource was Brighton, - every-
body's resource, from the Prince to the haberdasher. It
was enough to put her out of conceit with being out of
spirits, to have to exhibit her black crape or blue devils on
the Steyne !
There was a time when I used to agree with Lady Or-
mington. It seemed a deuced hard thing to have no
intermediary spot, betwixt the Hall and Hanover Square ;
some genteel purgatory, between paradise and its antipodes.
Every now and then, in the cowslip season, her ladyship
used to be taken rural, and “ babble of green fields.” She
would sigh over the advertisements of the auctioneers,
grandiloquizing the glories of Richmond Hill or the
beauties of Shenley, till “ the greenth and gloomth" of
Horace Walpole were outdone. I really thought Lord
Ormington would have to end with bartering his borough
for the rangership of the parks; or one of his Yorkshire
woods for a grove of Canada poplars in the purlieus of
Primrose Hill.
But now that my official helotism was beginning to
familiarize me with the ministerial snuggeries ranged along
the river from Vauxhall Bridge to that of Richmond, in
white and sparkling rows, like the mineral teeth of Desira-
bode, I was beginning to thank his obduracy. How be.
frogged I used to feel, after one of those dinners of
Votefilch's !- Nothing but Undine could have swum it!
- Will-o'-the-wisps must have danced oftentimes, after
night-fall, over his lordship's lawn; and his ponds and
tanks bore forcible resemblance to tureens of green-pea
soup or basins of turtle. I fancied I felt fins expanding,
after a day in his charming fen.

like charm, or entitled one to dream of “ Sabrina fair,"
uplifting her “ pearly arms ” from the "pure translucent
wave;" but between the pewter-tinted Thames, and the
dingy sallows, there stagnated even at high tide, a strip of
alluvial soil, barely concealed by patches of coarse rushes,
while, at low tide, were perceptible some twenty yards of
that filthiest deposit of the cloacæ of London and its
suburbs, called Thames mud; compelling one, at times, to
hold one's nose, and inclining one, at others, to close one's
eyes.
On one side of Maybush Lodge there was a great soap

The exulting and abounding river !

propitious to the natatorial essays of the preparatory schools
in the neighbourhood, no less than to the termination of
the woes of certain deluded sempstresses, induced to listen
to the Tempter in the Eden of Cumberland Tea-gardens
or other rustic resorts in the parishes of Chelsea and Mil-
bank ; — the river of coal-barges and lighters, funny-clubs
and wherries ; where, three times a week or so, one has
the satisfaction of beholding the victims of much punch
dashed against the piers of the bridges, and dived for by
the jolly young watermen, as though they were the pearls
of Ormus or the wreck of the Royal George ; — while
catches and glees, oaths and imprecations, shrieks and
groans, « oars and skulls,” constitute the intermingling
music of its waters ! -

whose white-bait delight in gas, and whose eels luxuriate
in pyroligneous acid :— sooner locate beside the foetid
banks of a Batavian canal, sooner become a toll-keeper of
Lethe's wharf, than breathe my summer breath within
scent of thine unsavoury odours, within reach of thy pan-
demoniacal sounds!
Lord Votefilch's villa was one of the best of those com-
pact white dwelling-houses,“ seated,” as George Robins
calls it, “ on a verdant lawn,” like a solitary billiard-ball
lying on its green table. The house was commodious
within ; without, of Doric architecture. Nothing fanciful
about it, nothing rustic ; but it was as damp as a catacomb,
unless during the dog-days, when its frontage lay exposed
to a glaring south-western sun.
Maybush Lodge was the growth of royal favouritsm. It
had been created in George the Second's time by the old
Duke of Newcastle ; and during the long reign of his
royal grandson had as regularly alternated with the Whigs
and Tories, as if a part of the administration. What tales
could its wainscots have unfolded, if wainscots were in-
cluded in the category of wooden orators ! - What con-
spiracies (against the country) had been hatched in its
premier-coop !What wars and rumours of wars had gone
forth from its portals !-How often had France been sent
to the devil under its covered ceilings; how often the
balance of power weighed in its scales, and found wanting.
Poor Maybush Lodge !--green eyrie, to which the crook-
beaked birds of prey retreated to feed their young ones
with young ones torn from the nests of other birds,- what
heaps of whitened bones my mind's eye seemed to descry
around the retreat of the plunderers !
To do mine host justice, no one could more gallantly
lay aside the cares of state, or hang up more resolutely in
his hall the toga of public life. There was a Lady Vote-
filch ; - a woman of a certain age and uncertain temper,
whose former beauty one took for granted, though little
trace of it remained, as the only means of accounting for
the infatuation which had rendered so shrewd a man the
proprietor of such a nonentity. There was a niece, too,
either of hers or his, who resided with them, - a certain

Lady Theresa, - the idol of my colleagues in Downing
Street. It was a matter of special duty among such of
them as were admitted to share the venison and household
leisure of their chef, to fall in love with Lady Theresa.
I scarcely know why. She was not old, - not ugly,--
not disagreeable ; — negative qualities at best ; but it was
like finding a flower in the wilderness, to discover anything
approaching to young, pretty, or agreeable among those
bald heads and sunken faces. The first time I saw her
sitting there among them, mute and undemonstrative, į
wondered what the deuce Chippenham, Herries, and the
rest of them had found in her, to turn their heads. But
after a dinner or two at Maybush Lodge, I began to ex-
amine her more curiously, — to experience an interest in
her merits, - to watch her inexpressive blue eyes with
the hope of detecting some talent, sentiment, or emotion.
She was the only very human thing present. A bird
which alights upon the mast during a sea voyage is an
object of intense interest to the mariner, however dingy
its plumage or poor its note.
To make the agreeable to Lady Votefilch and her niece,
at the Sunday dinners, was part of the week's duty. The
major part of the task was easy enough. Lady V. was a
vain foolish woman, not too fastidious in the quality of
adulation. To compliment her on her beauty, had been
scandal in disguise ; but she was content to accept the
far more easily levied tribute of compliments upon her
toilet. She cared for nothing but dress. A reigning
divinity of Fashion, she was also one of its votaries ;
dressed not so much in the fashion of the day, as à la
mode de demain. While the Right Hon. Sec. was invent-
ing political combinations and speculating upon European
alliances, she was caballing with Madame Le Brun, the
Talleyrand of modern modistes, concerning revolutions in
caps, and conspiracies against turbans that be.
To such a woman, Cecil the son of Lady Ormington
the Lady Ormington - could not but be an object of
interest ; and when she found I had tact enough to refrain
from dedicating my sighs with the general monsoon of the
Foreign Office to Lady Theresa, she concluded that I

recognized my insufficiencies as a younger son, and begged
Lord Votefilch to honour my forbearance by a general
invitation. He knew better, — for he really wished to
see me familiarly at his table; and consequently restricted
his civility to giving me a formal invitation more frequently
than to the rest of his quill machinery.
Chippenham and I arrived late. When we made our
appearance, dinner had been announced, and people were
pairing slowly off with much form and ceremony, to tra-
verse in couples twelve yards of Brussels carpeting, over
which they would have stepped singly without form or
embarrassment. Old Votefilch was conducting a fine-
looking woman, known to me by name and history ; then
came her ladyship, escorted by a stupid-looking man, who
I saw must be somebody, or he would not have presumed
to look so stupid ; and lastly came Lady Theresa, arm-in-
arm with the lion of the hour, — with Danby! - It was
Chippenham's privilege and place; but my dilatoriness
had deprived him of his honours ; and we were compelled
to scuffle in with Herries and two great unknowns, to
promiscuous places at table.
Though far from in my best of humours, I was soon
interested in the conversation, which, at such tables, flows
as naturally as if helped round with the soup. The two
nondescripts were official men of first-rate abilities, on
their preferment; the glassy-eyed individual supporting
Lady Votefilch, was Lord Falkirk, a man who affected
dulness as Pope Sixtus caducity, in order to influence, un-
suspected, the Conclave or Privy Council ; and the tall
handsome woman in white satin, was one of those showy
intrigantes, those prima donnas of society, who, what-
ever minister shall reign, are always to be found in musk-
scented note-paper correspondence with Downing Street.
It was none of these, however, who imparted the collo-
quial charm to that chatty little party. It was the man
who seemed determined to extinguish me by his superi-
ority, in private as in public life. As the trunk of the
elephant is constituted to pick up a straw after crushing
the body of a man, Danby seemed bent on proving to his
humiliated younger brother, that his small-talk was as

135
great as his speaking was effective. He could drive a
tandem as readily as the car of Jaggernaut.
To do him justice, I never met a more agreeable man.
There was something fascinating beyond description in the
melodious refinement of his enunciation. His tone was
easy, his language fluent, and he was as good a listener
as ready 'in reply,-- prompt in argument, modest in pur-
suing an advantage. Budge and Fudge, the official aspi.
rants, were evidently vexed to find themselves thrown into
the shade by so young a man. But they were soon
reconciled. There is no disgrace in being eclipsed by
Jupiter.
Next to the chattiness of my brother, the thing that
struck me most, was the influence of time and place upon
my collaborators, Chippenham and Herries. Herries was,
by birth and education, official. He was the Asmodeus
of an ink-bottle. His cradle had been a despatch box,
his swaddling-clothes were sheets of government foolscap.
At the desk, he was great, for the atmosphere of Downing
Street was as natal air to him; and like Antæus, on
touching treasury-ground he became invincible. I had
always stood in awe of Herries' superior abilities, when I
saw him issue from the Blue Chamber, with confidential
documents in his hand, such as were entrusted by Lord
Votefilch to no sub. but himself.
But at Maybush Lodge, his distinctions vanished. At
Maybush Lodge, the peacock became a dingy jay again.
I suppose it was because he did not feel himself at ease;
but he was tongue-tied. He joined in the conversation
only to become an obstruction. A fastidious choice of
expressions embarrassed his diction. He became heavy
and verbose from trying to talk too well ; missed the
point of every story he attempted to relate ; and filled up
the pauses of his conversation with an unmeaning
laugh.
Chippenham, on the contrary, who was anything but a
genius, and who at the office passed for a ninny, became
talkative and agreeable among people of his caste. The
subjects discussed were familiar to him. His pockets were
full of the small change current in such society. He had
K 4

twice as much to say as Halbert Herries; or rather, with
half as much to say, quadrupled it by his easy unaffected
mode of expression. I perceived that with him Danby
was quite ready to talk and listen ; whereas, when poor
Herries addressed him, he fixed his eyes vacantly on the
stammering man, who seemed baffled by the redundancy
of his ideas or the insufficiency of his elocution. I was
amused, -perhaps a little gratified. In the office, Her-
ries had the best of it. Whenever Chippenham, or I, or
Percy, or De l'Isle stood convicted of the blunders inevit-
able to even the cleverest of novices, he used to over-crow
us without ceremony. I was not sorry to see him silenced
by my brother.
At that period, the Whigs and Tories of public life,
whether dictating in the House “avec ce calme sans en-
trailles qu'on appelle la dignité parlementaire,” or disputing
after dinner with the drouthiness of men whose real
business in life is that of converting full decanters into
empty ones, were now properly divided into a party
maintaining that one Englishman could lick four French-
men, or that England - bangs Banagher, which bates the
world ;”-- and a party beholding in Napoleon a man in
authorized command of the powers of darkness, - Demo-
gorgon, minus his hoofs. The after-dinner politics of
London consisted of “ Are we to annihilate the French, or
are the French to annihilate us ?”– It is rather late in
the history of the world to assign such overweening
majesty to the edge of the sword. It was one of the
evidences of the brutalizing power of war, that, from long
contemplation of perpetual and bloody conflict, we were
retrograding to the insensibilities of the dark ages. The
law of the stronger was becoming our Alpha and Omega.
Precisely on this point, was the superiority of Danby's
mind apparent. His ideas were not exclusively extracted
from the returns of the War Office, or the statistics of
Extraordinary Gazettes. Danby marched with the times,
or, rather, marched with the pioneers who clear the way
for the progress of the times. It was upon the force
of public opinion and the strength of popular feeling
throughout Europe, that he grounded his calculations.

His judgment was not moulded by the dictation of per-
emptory articles in Quarterly Reviews. He was a scholar,
and a ripe one. His studies at Ormington Hall were not
comprised, as I had chosen to imagine, within limit of the
Aldine authorities. Herodotus and Thucydides were but
the plinth of the column of his universal knowledge. The
modern, living, breathing, circulating literature of Europe,
the pulses and arteries of the contemporaneous body of
mankind, constituted the pillar's strength.
French, German, Italian, nay, even the Sclavonic lan-
guages, were familiar to him ; and liberally supplied with
the best publications of the day, he possessed a key to the
gates of that mighty continent, from which, as by a
miracle, we were so long shut out. In the progress of
public enlightenment, he traced the progress of public
events. It was from the excitement of Germany, the in-
dignation of Russia, the resentments of Holland, that he
drew his horoscope of France, and foretold the downfal
of a triton of the minnows, a Gulliver among the Lillipu-
tians, a Cæsar among the principicules of Germany, whom
the liberals of France detested as un grand homme avorté
en empereur, - a conquerer whose foot was not only upon
the neck of humbled nations but upon that of public
opinion, — the executioner of the Duc d'Enghien and of
the liberty of the press ;-- a man whose greatness was
composed of the wrecks of a great revolution, as the early
temples of Italy were framed of shattered fragments of
the noble architecture of former ages.
Newsvenders' horns were not his only organs of infor-
mation. Wellington might be a great general, but Danby
humbly opined that a still more powerful instrument was
the combination of the many, against the tyranny of the
one; - a balance of power, having France and its cannon
in one scale, and Europe, with the consciousness of right,
in the other. He foresaw clearly, and announced mode-
rately, that the days of the empire were numbered.
Nothing more enrages a knot of middle-aged official
men, who have been buffeting all their lives with the waves,
till familiar with the strength of unseen currents and the
peril of sunken rocks, (the practical difficulties of public

life,) than to find a young fellow, of necessity a mere
theorist, pretend to see further through the mists of politics
than themselves. It is useless to insinuate that, while en-
gaged in the difficult operation of keeping their heads above
water, he may have been stationed in the lighthouse,
beholding,
— as from a tower, the end of all ; -
a warden, anxiously watching the operations of contending
parties.
To the arguments modestly put forth by the young
Member for Rigmarole, accordingly, Budge and Fudge
replied by interchanging glances of contempt. They knew
nothing, not they, of the power and views of Russia.
They cared nothing about Berlin. Germany was, to them,
a country where a deluded population applauded Schiller's
Robbers, or whimpered over the sorrows of Werther. They
quoted Pitt and Fox, Windham and Percival ; they talked
about invariable principles, and the wisdom of our ances-
tors ; but they wanted to hear nothing about the continent.
The quarrel lay in a nutshell ; the question was comprised
in the Peninsula. It was there the oriflamme was dis-
played; it was there that the cabinet was writing its lead-
ing articles in characters of blood.
But for old Votefilch, Danby would have been talked
down ; but the Right Hon. Secretary understood the art of
extracting information, even under the semblance of dis-
paragement; and took care that the young talker, who
talked not for victory but out of the abundance of his heart,
should have “ ample space and verge enough” for the
manifestations of his knowledge.
I saw Lady Votefilch shrug her shoulders in despair.
She had hoped better things of an elder brother of mine,
(for herself,) and better things of an elder son of Lord
Ormington (for Lady Theresa). Even I, as regarded my
own feelings, should have been better pleased to find him
less earnestly occupied with la chose publique at that mo-
ment. I had made up my mind to a frank explanation
with him. My heart was more open towards John than it
had been since our days of nankin frocks; and I trusted
to see him more reserved in my presence. I had even

hoped to find him angry; for it is a work of labour and
sorrow to stir up the cold embers of indifference.
Most young people fall into the blunder of attributing
to all other human natures the strength or weakness of
their own; or, as my friend Fetlock expressed it, “ they
buy and sell by their own bushel.” I, for instance, chose
to judge of Danby by myself — my Self, like most other
young men, warm-hearted and generous while glorying in
the affectation of superciliousness and folly. But there are
spirits both brighter and blacker than this sweeping
denomination; and Danby was of the minority. I shall
not explain whether of the elect virtuous, or elect vicious;
but he was better or worse than the common herd. When,
taking him apart after dinner, I entered warmly into my
self-exculpation, instead of expanding into the generous
warmth I anticipated, admitting himself to have been over-
hasty, and like the hero of a German comedy, throwing
himself into my arms and swearing eternal friendship, he
listened calmly, judged dispassionately, — advised me
to be more prudent in the selection of my confidants, —
and turned on his heel!
I was furious !--I had accosted him, charged to the
muzzle with magnanimity, - my coxcombry laid aside,
my envyings and jealousies subdued, — my fraternal sym-
pathies on the qui vive. — His coolness chilled me to the
heart's core !—I had only despised the ugly John of
former days—I hated the Honourable Member for Rig-
marole, at whose bidding the stormy debaters were still.
Biting my lip till the blood started, I lounged across the
drawing-room, and affected as much empressement with
that classical antique Lady Votefilch as the tall beauty,
Mrs. Wrottesley, was bestowing upon the Foreign affairs ;
and, on sufficiently recovering my composure to glance
round the room, saw that Lord Falkirk was talking apart
with my brother; while Budge, Fudge, and Halbert Her-
ries stood pretending to converse together, with their ears
pricked up to catch a word here and there of the conversa-
tion. Even Chippenham, though smiled upon by the
gentle Lady Theresa, was evidently wanting to get away,
and hear what Danby was saying. His influence had

fixed its teeth upon them all. The power of the strong
mind was manifest. Danby had snatched the tiara from
their hands, and crowned himself infallible.
We had scarcely even noted the transcendent excellence
of a dinner from the casseroles of La Fenouille, the Fran-
catelle of his day. We had not so much as even found
fault with the common criterion of approval) the finest
claret then extant in port-bibbing England. We did not
perceive that the lawns of Maybush were steeped in deli-
cious moonlight, or that the fragrance of a thousand flower
beds was stealing in through the open widows. For
through dinner, dessert, coffee, a master-spell had been
upon our minds; and Lady Theresa and Mrs. Wrottesley
smiled as vainly as the moon was shining.
There was but one way of breaking the charm, – Lady
Votefilch asked for 6 a little music.” Forth came the
harp, and up started Chippenham, who sang charmingly in
every style. Not a more efficient method of delivering
society from the ascendency of a superior man, than to
call for that general extinguisher of light —"a little
music !”
The only bad result to myself was that Chippenham, to
whom on our return to town I was inclined to enlarge
upon the bore of the whole thing, was of course so pleased
at having heard himself sing, that he had forgotten having
heard my brother hold forth. I could have killed him
for the good faith with which he declared that he had
been spending a very pleasant evening.
He put the finishing stroke to my ill-humour as we
passed Hyde-Park Corner, (where a huge turnpike used
in those days bid every man stand and deliver, ere he
set foot in London,) by inquiring whether he should meet
me at dinner, at Morley's, the following day.
“ Not asked ? - How came that about?”—
Is there a greater impertinence than to inquire the
motive of one's being omitted from some agreeable
party ? -

SECOND VOLUME.
CHAPTER I.
Se amor non è, che dunque sento ?
PETRARCA.
How the first little rubs of life linger in one's memory!
I have had my share of grievances. I have drunk my fill
of vinegar and hyssop. Yet I can recall to mind, even
now, the irritation of smarting under the impertinence of
Lady Harriet Vandeleur, the contempts of Morley, the
vulgar quizzing of Jack Harris, and, above all, the coolness
of my brother.
There are moments when petty slights are harder to
bear than even a serious injury. Men have died of the
festering of a gnat-bite. Yet, strange to tell, the only
person on whom I visited my vexation of spirit, was one
who had never offered me offence; - Emily was the
victim. Not even her pale anxious face, watching for me
throughout the opera and ballet, exercised an extenuating
influence. She looked sad as a white rose over a sepul-
chre; yet I remained cruel, - cruel as a grand inquisitor
or a jealous woman.
I never went near her.— Poor Emily! - Though I had
almost given up my projects relative to Lady Harriet, I
could not make up my mind to condescend again so
readily. Besides, she was always attainable ; I might take
her up again at any time. That was the secret of my
coolness. We grow indifferent to blessings whose conti-
nuance is assured, the light of the sun, the bursting of
the spring,—all the fairest phenomena of nature. I should
have taken the trouble, perhaps, to ascend to the old box,
had I surmised that I was fated never to see her there

again! For after that night, it remained empty. It was
some comfort not to see it polluted by strange faces, par-
ticularly such faces as one usually espies at that ignomi-
nious altitude. But it had been let for the season to the
d'Acunhas, who neither returned nor underlet it.
After the first night of missing them from the spot,
how I used to sit and watch that box ! — No astronomer
waiting the rising of his newly-discovered planet could
be more intensely anxious. My “ upturned and won-
dering eyes” must have given me a strangely ridiculous
appearance ; but, for once, I was not thinking of
appearances.
I bore it for a week — a fortnight; still, not a vestige
of her. The season was drawing to a close. I had taken
no heed of its waning pleasures since I became anxious
about Emily. I was haunted by the pale pensive face, of
which I had merely said at the time, “ Emily is not in
beauty to-night,- I will go and visit her another time."
The last representation of the season took place. Every-
body who frequents the Opera, and happens to be in
town, is sure to be there on the last night; and I made
sure of seeing her. I provided myself with one of her
favourite magnolias. I felt my cheek burn with eagerness
as I took my station in the pit, with my eyes uplifted as
usual. I dare say Morley was in Lady Harriet's box. I
never looked. I was thinking only of Emily.
But the box was again vacant !- That night it looked
to me like a tomb. I knew that my last chance of meet-
ing her was at an end. For six gloomy months, no opera.
For six gloomy months, that box, so long a paradise, must
remain a little, dusty, damp, ill-savoured closet, given over
to mice and spiders. I hurried up to sit there once more.
The box-keeper readily admitted me, and I took Emily's
place behind the curtain. I even laid down the magnolia
before it on the crimson cushion, as if she were there.
The scent of vanille lingered there still, as though its
former inmates had only just quitted the place; and so
powerfully were they brought before me by the association,
that I kept expecting every minute to hear their voices by
my side.

I could stand this suspense no longer. Next day, after
office, I went straight to Southampton Buildings. Nay, I
inquired explicitly and without hesitation for Miss Barnet,
I was desperate.
My inquiry struck no amazement into Pepper-and-Salt.
He seemed almost prepared for it; almost to expect that
one of Mr. Hanmer's clients should knock at the door,
and ask to see his ward ; and there was a twinkle of satis-
faction in the creature's eye, as he announced that “ Miss
Emily warn't there no longer.”
" Was she gone to Monsieur d’Acunha's !”-
« May be she was — may he she warn’t - he couldn't
say. Should he inquire of the head clerk ? "
It was, of course, more agreeable to me to inquire of
d'Acunha himself; so away I went to Burton Crescent.-
A bill up! - This HOUSE TO LET ! - Deeply mortified, I
turned my horse's head once more towards the West-end.
But on reaching Portland Road, I had the weakness to
turn, and to return. Perhaps the person charged to show
the house, might afford information. I alighted, and re-
quested to look at it; and the dry, withered, wooden thing
in a green-baize apron, - man, woman, child, - for it
seemed to partake of all three,- immediately began to
enlarge upon the size of the “ parlours” and the extreme
convenience of sinks and pumps, sufficiently innocent of
this world's sophistications, to believe that a person of my
manners and appearance entertained serious intentions
towards a house in Burton Crescent, at a period of the
year when filberts and jargonelle pears were coming into
season !
I inquired after the last lodgers : it knew nothing about
them. It was “put in by the house-agent.” It “ s'posed
the last ludgers was furriners; for the house smelt of
baccy enough to p'ison one." It even wanted to tell me
how much soap and how many scrubbing-brushes had
been required to obliterate the d’Acunhas.
I went home thoroughly wretched. While my illusions
lasted, I had scarcely noted the progress of the season.
They were gone, and I discovered that I was alone. All
was over. There was not only no Emily, but no London.

At Watier's that night, scarcely a soul ! -- It had never
occured to me before, that a Government clerk was a
denizen of Downing Street; that the rest of the world
shot grouse, - toured to the lakes, — or betook itself to
the silvery sands of the Isle of Wight, — while a clerkly pen
must perforce remain in the ink, and a clerkly hand on the
pounce-box. I began to think (as I sulked in the corner
of the sofa at Watier's, sole monarch of all I surveyed,)
like a grumbling minister, who has been snubbed by his
sovereign, or by his sovereign's sovereign, the House of
Commons, — about sending in my resignation.
The recollection of Lord Ormington's stiff conditions
touching the ways and means, luckily suspended my
resolution. I had not forgotten Lady Harriet's advice to
me, not to trifle with Lord Ormington. Moreover, he
was out of town. I had never missed him. I ought to
have inferred that he was gone ; for parliament was up,
and our officials comparatively out of harness. Nothing
remained but the clerks and the desks : the rest of the
wooden furniture had migrated. But though the rumble
of Lord Ormington's carriage every evening had ceased,
and the grumble of Lord Votefilch's discontent every
morning, I had been unconscious of my loss.
Such among my readers as may have been compelled to
outlast the season in London, from being in office, in love,
or in debt, must recollect the strangeness of suddenly dis-
covering, like Aladdin, that the magic palace has disappeared.
For the last month, we notice hosts of travelling-carriages
departing, with a sensation of relief. The dull and elderly
go first. All June and July, one sees family-coaches
setting forth with post-horses as one is coming home from
balls ; and then, there is triumph in remaining : for it is
the select few who are left, to eat the diners d'élite, and
do all sorts of pleasant things never attempted so long as
the mob remains undecimated. It is a distinction to be
one of the court-cards kept in hand. Carlton House was
never so brilliant as during the dog-days. The last fort-
night of the season resembles one of those fine summer's
nights when only stars of the first magnitude are visible ;
when favourite constellations stand out in relief, all the

145
myriads of little stars having hidden their diminished
heads !
But this distinction imparts only a deeper shade to the
succeeding darkness. On the day which rouses us to the
consciousness of being alone in hot, dusty London, when the
oblique rays of the autumnal sun betray the coating of soot
and dust encrusting the houses, - when the sparrows, grown
tame, hop chirping impertinently along the streets, — when
the city looks and smells like a city of apple-stalls, — when
shopmen stand with pens behind their ears on the door-steps
instead of behind their counters, — when the suburban
theatres and gardens placard the walls and palings, (and
all London in a state of repair, furnishes palings in
abundance,) with every variety of coloured paper announcing
every sameness of colourless entertainment; then it is we
suddenly inquire where all the people are gone; - and
Echo answers " Where? -"
What a relief when the hollow nymph favoured me for
the first time with this contemptuous reply, to reflect upon
Lady Ormington's morbid appetite for the Metropolis ! -
It was an unspeakable comfort to think that our house was
not going to be paled in or shuttered up like the rest. On
the day I returned home from my expedition to the house
agent's who had the letting of the “ family mansion ” in _
Burton Crescent, with information that the d’Acunhas had í
sailed by the Oporto packet, on the first of the month, for \ /
Portugal, and that, to the best of his belief, they were
accompanied by a young English lady, name unknown, I
could scarcely have borne to find myself alone in an
uninhabited house. Even Bibiche was better company than
my thoughts.
For my reflections were anything but rose-coloured. I
was fain to confess that, with all my tact and cleverness,
my season had been a failure. I had achieved nothing.
My advantages had been great, the result — fiasco ! — My
squinting brother was at the top of the tree. The last
object that struck me, on the last night of the Opera, was
Jack Harris installed in the Vandeleur's box ; not on
sufferance, but smiled upon and encouraged by Lady
Harriet and the Marchioness of Devereux, - evidently on

the way to obtain waistcoat the third. Chippenham was
the established pet of May bush Lodge, and Danby was
gone down to Lady Warburton's family seat, as the
accepted lover of Lady Susan Theydon. Everybody had
paired off, saving myself.
When these humiliating conclusions occurred to me, I
presumed to accuse Emily as the origin of my failure !
Second thoughts whispered “ Curse not Southampton
Buildings, even in thy chamber.” A painful presentiment
already connected itself in my mind with the sweet face I
had seen looking so sorrowfully down upon me from the
opera-box.
The impression did not diminish as the autumn drew
on. “ Les jours se suivent,” says the proverb, “ et ne se
ressemblent pas.” The torment of London, out of the
season, is that one day telleth another, and one night cer-
tifieth another: eternal sameness, — the sameness of a sea
voyage. Even the business of my official morning was
thrice as tedious as during the session of parliament. The
gods were departed ; - the master-spirits gone who im-
parted some relief to my labours. There was no one left
beside myself but Herries - plodding Herries, one very
silent senior clerk, pretty much on a par, in point of intel-
lect, with Babbage's Calculating Machine, — and two or
three juniors, whose chief recreation, like my own and
other natives, consisted in gaping. The Parks were enve-
loped in mist. The Town lay rotting like the fat weed on
Lethe's wharf. It was like a city of the plague, nay,
worse. In the terrible descriptions of Defoe and Boc-
caccio, there is something to excite the two strongest of
our sympathies, pity and terror. Autumnal London
excites nothing but ennui. - I would as soon dig in a lead
mine!
'I record all this by way of apology for the infatuation
with which I soon began to attach myself to the recol-
lection of Emily Barnet. I had fitted up my second
chamber as a sort of study, — a study of anything but
books ; for I neither was, nor pretended to be, a reading
man. But I studied there something more valuable in the
perusal than printed paper. I studied my Self,-- I studied

the past. My leisure was the leisure of busy reverie.
Whether seated, meerschaum in hand, before my sparkling
fire, or pacing my rooms with listless steps, I was absorbed
in living over again the events of the last few months, arm-
in-arm with Cecil Danby.
And how wonderfully did poor Emily gain by the retro-
spection! How sweetly did her words and looks come
back upon my memory! I could recal to mind only what
was thoroughly attractive — thoroughly attaching. I had
never heard a sentiment escape her lips that was not noble
and gracious. I had never seen her indulge in a look or
an attitude but might have served as the model for an
artist. An atmosphere of poetry surrounded her, - com-
municating a charm to all she touched, all she addressed.
I recalled to mind the originality of her opinions, the
freshness of her ideas, – the vividness of her expressions,
the tenderness of her attachment for her absent father ;
and no longer wondered that such companionship had
estranged me from the vapid nothingness of the great world.
Lady Harriet was equally brilliant, — more brilliant. But
in her, not a touch of nature; in her not a gleam of the
womanliness imparting so surpassing a charm to the con-
versation of Emily.
And this angelic being was lost to me for ever!—I had
ascertained beyond a doubt that she was gone. At the
very time I was harassing myself with expeditions into
Bloomsbury, she was already on the high season her
way to the land of citron groves, and the parent whose
protection she should never have quitted. I should see
and hear of her no more. Had she remained in England,
perhaps we should have been equally alienated; for a
Miss Emily Barnet could never be more than a Miss
Emily Barnet to Cis Danby. Still, it was something to
be within reach of such an embellishment to one's exist-
ence; like knowing that a volume of choice poetry is at
hand, which we may snatch up and peruse, when we find
the realities of life growing too hard for our digestion.
Sometimes my reveries assumed a less favourable colour.
After excess of solitude, as after all excesses, a reaction of
feeling takes place. Ne sait aimer qui ne sait haïr. I

used to gratify my irritation by uttering blasphemies against
my Egeria. She had come upon me so strangely, and
departed so mysteriously, nay, she was so disconnected
with the world of which I formed a part, that I began
almost to doubt her existence. She was a feu follet, a
will-o'-the-wisp. — “ Earth hath its bubbles, and she was
of them.” I thought of Melusina the sorceress, beloved
by the Comte de Poitiers, whose face was that of an angel,
whose body that of a serpent. I thought — but why
recapitulate the foolish fancies of a lover or madman ? -
After all, if I had fallen into the snare of an enchantress,
there was some pride in having retained, after a college
education, the generous weakness which admits of be-
coming a dupe.
I struggled hard to get out of the net. Fine sentiment
was not the order of the day. The pallid muse of Byron,
in her black-crape weepers, had not yet brought despair
and anguish into fashion. There was no encouragement
to turn Octavian, or let grow one's beard. After all, if
I had overrated my destinies, — if I had mistaken the
salutation of the weird sisters on my arrival in London,
if I had fancied that I was to be king of (the beau monde)
hereafter, - hereafter was a wide word, -- I need not yet
despair of my enthronization. Jack Harris might have
made his way faster ; but his extinction would probably
be rapid in proportion to his elevation, like the fusee of a
rocket. Danby might be crowned with laurels ; but they
would, perhaps, wither while mine were flourishing!
I determined, in short, to box it out with destiny, and
put myself in a Cribb-like attitude for a milling-match
with my fortunes; and when at length even Lady Orming-
ton's maternal sensibilities were insufficient to detain her
in a city where nothing remained but Irish bricklayers and
gentlemen compelled to live by rule, I dashed down to
Melton, while she departed for the Hall; and by dint of
drinking and riding at the pace at which Satan might ride
and drink when indulging in one of those “ Walks on
earth” which Porson and multitudes of imitators have
immortalized in the “ verse that eternally saves" (even
Satan),– I returned to Downing Street at the close of my

six weeks' leave of absence, with the tremour of my heart
transferred to my hands.
Between agitation of mind and body I was now thoroughly
done up.
I went through my duties like one walking in his sleep.
Unless when a packet arrived from Lisbon, I found it
impossible to interest myself in the progress of public
affairs. I had ascertained that the vessel which bore the
d'Acunhas from this country had reached Portugal in
safety. I knew that she was back again with her fond
father, - back again at Cintra, — back again among those
beloved haunts of cliff and shore which she used to paint
with such bewildering enthusiasm. So much the better !
- All that remained for me was to recommence life anew,
from the point at which I had been distracted from my
career by this luckless acquaintance. I had just attained
my majority; an excellent epoch for a new start.
It happened that Chippenham, into whose society I was
thrown by the business of the office, was nearly as much
out of sorts with fortune as myself. After falling into the
snare set for him by Lady Votefilch, which he called falling
desperately in love with Lady Theresa, his father, Lord
Merepark, was kind enough to extricate him by an assu-
rance in writing, that he was too young to settle, and that
for many years to come it was out of his power to make a
settlement upon him. It is well known that next to a
pipe of Port, there is nothing so difficult to settle as the
eldest son of a peer of the realm.
Chippenham had no means of helping himself. The
Votefilchs dared not encourage him to brave and bring
down on them the displeasure of a father, having three
boroughs and a half at his disposal ; and all that remained
for him was to join with me in execrating the ruggedness
of the course of true love, and in exorcising the little god
by the power of a bigger — Bacchus versus Cupid. I
scarcely know the love that could stand out against a
couple of bottles of claret a day, topped up with garus
punch.

more admirable than in a weedy ditch or mudpool. I am
not so sure of a genius for depicting sloughs; and will
consequently pass over the dissipation of two desperate
boys, in the enjoyment of too much leisure, cash, and
health, and finding an apology for their own vicious incli-
nations, in the pretext of having a secret sorrow to escape
from. I had every prospect of becoming “un de ces en-
fins du siècle, caducs avant d'avoir vécu, et fanfarons de
désillusions.” Now-a-days, when a young man is affected
by a fever of the heart, or ague of the mind, such as the
feelings which drove us into folly, he goes abroad. The
Continent is a mighty safety-valve. It is surprising the
quantity of vice that escapes in that direction. But during
the war, people were obliged to stay and sow their wild
oats in London; and fertile was the crop ever ripe for the
sickle !-- The coffee-room at Stevens's could tell tales if it
choose!— But it had better hold its tongue.
If the brilliant coteries of the fashionable world had
been unable to efface the impression made upon me by the
fascinations of Emily, it was not likely that the unrefined,
unlettered heroines with whom I was now in contact,
should obliterate that charming recollection. It required
all the madness of the orgie to render me sufficiently blind
and deaf to support their company, even for an hour. I
can understand the fable of the Sirens having been invented
for such creatures; only that in modern times one is forced
to put cotton in one's ears to avoid the disgust of their
discourse, instead of the fascination of their song.
Do what I would, however, — laugh and listen, or listen
and sneer, — eat, drink, and be merry, or merely drink
and be sad, - the ever-haunting face and form were before
me. My follies and vices appeared to add new force to
the vividness of that first impression. As the treasures of
Herculaneum and Pompeii have been preserved in pristine
freshness by showers of cinders, the lava, intended for the
destruction of the image cherished in my heart, served for
its preservation.
The only sacrifice, the only victim, was myself. After
months of vulgar dissipation, I found myself more irritable
in temper, more infirm in health, and thoroughly disgusted

with my profligate companions. People were returning to
town again ; but whether they came or stayed away, I
cared not. Parliament was about to unloose its thousand
tongues, — but whether they wagged wisely, or too well,
was a matter of indifference. A cloud was upon my spirit.
I was only half a coxcomb. I seldom appeared in Lady
Ormington's coterie, - never in those of her gay associates.
I was becoming a lost man.
One day, – it was but a few before the meeting of par-
liament, and I was beginning to anticipate Lord Orming-
ton's presence, superadded to my domestic displeasures, -
when I was struck by the elongated visage of Herries,
issuing from the Blue Chamber at the Foreign Office.
“ What the deuce is the matter, Hal?” cried Chippen-
ham. “Is Grimgruffinhoff vicious this morning ? Has he
quarrelled with the syntax of your last despatch, or —”
To our great surprise, Herries, who was the meekest of
mankind, replied by dashing down his papers on the table,
with the addition of an interjection not to be found in any
polite dictionary.
“My dear fellow, you seem horrifically out of sorts ?”
said I, looking up from my desk, — almost envying him
the power of being in a rage with anything so small as His
Majesty's Secretariate of State.
" And so would you,” cried Herries, white with suppressed
ire, “ if, after having drudged here, as I have been doing
for the last fourteen months, without even applying for a
day's holiday, and being, at length, on the eve of asking
for two months' leave, for the purpose of — of -- no
matter! ”
“ Well, well, we will take the purpose for granted. If,
after all this, you say, we were to — what? --"
“ To be sent pitching over the Bay of Biscay, in the
month of December, to deliver despatches to Sir Charles
Stuart, which would be quite as safe in the hands of John
the porter !"
“Off to Lisbon ? _" cried Chippenham – Percy — all
of us at once.
“ Lucky dog!” added I, in a lower tone, and no longer
in chorus.
L 4

“ Lucky ? -" exclaimed Herries, angrily taking me up.
“ I should like to see you resign yourself to such luck!
I should like to see Lord Votefilch send any one of you on
such an expedition ! He knows better. There would be
fathers and mothers, or, rather, ayes and noes after him,
in no time. It is only because I have no parliamentary
interest to back me— because I am fils de mes æuvres."
“ Hush, hush !—” cried Chippenham, who really liked
Herries, and saw that he was committing himself.
“ Poor Hal! ” added Percy, provokingly. “ It shan't
be sent to Lisbon. It shan't sail up the Tagus. It shall
stay at home and eat its Christmas turkey by its own
fireside.”
For my part I said nothing. I was wrapt in cogitation.
What if I could obtain to be sent in his room ? Not a
moment to be lost! I explained myself to Herries. He
was quite sincere in his detestation of the appointment.
It was not a nolo episcopari opposition, and he hastened,
hand-in-hand with me, to Lord Votefilch, representing
that I was exceedingly ambitious of replacing him ; that
I was slightly acquainted with the Portuguese language ;
that my health, which was in a declining state, would be
materially benefitted by a sea voyage ; and that the ser-
vices of Mr. Herries were, just then, peculiarly in request
in the office, for putting in train the arrangement of certain
official documents, previous to the meeting of parliament,
which had been especially recommended to his diligence by
the Lords of the Treasury.
My preamble went for nothing, — for worse than no-
thing, — for an impertinent interference with authority ; -
but this last argument decided the matter, and I was de-
sired to hold myself in readiness to start for Falmouth
that very night. Not a human being was in my con-
fidence, as regarded my loves and likings; and this sudden
application was, consequently, a thunderbolt in the office.
Herries thought me a fool; - all the rest, mad. — Had
Lord Ormington been in town, the thing would probably
have been prevented. As it was, I found it easy to per-
suade my mother that I had been selected by Government
as a confidential agent for a difficult duty; and, though

she wept a little, and begged me to take care and not put
myself in the way of the plague or the yellow fever, she
was comforted when I promised to send her home, by
return of packet, hanks of Lisbon chains and a “wilderness
of monkeys.” She still continued to murmur something
about Lisbon being such a dangerous place, and to beg me
to take care of the earthquake; but turning a deaf ear to
her maternal anxieties, I hurried away to issue my last
instructions to Tim, and a long farewell to the convolvulus
chamber.
My preparations were easily achieved. I bequeathed
to Lady Ormington the settlement of my Christmas bills.
Government was my courier.
Facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab astris !
My chaise was at the door,
My transport on the sea;
- and an announcement in the next day's Morning Post,
that, “ last evening the Hon. Cecil Danby left the Foreign
Office with despatches for his Majesty's minister at Lis-
bon,” contained all the adieux necessary to my disconsolate
friends and creditors.
Apart from the hope of seeing Emily again, there was
something in the suddenness of the measure that imparted
piquancy to my plan. As I rattled along the road, at the
pace which depositaries of despatch boxes contrived in
those days to be rattled, I could not help picturing to
myself the surprise of Lord Ormington, on his arrival in
town, at finding that, without departing from our compact,
I had contrived to distance both him and Messrs. Hanmer
and Snatch. It was a triumph, too, to know that I should
escape the mortification of being omitted among the invited
to Danby's wedding ; which the newspapers assured the
world was to take place soon after Christmas. Parthian-
like, I was intent upon leaving wounds behind me, as I
posted it along.
My enthusiasm, however, began to relax as the hurry
and excitement of departure gradually subsided. By the
moment of embarkation, I saw things in their true light,
which was far from a pleasant one ; and, without sharing

my mother's apprehensions of being swallowed up, either
in the Bay of Biscay or a second Lisbon earthquake, began
to perceive that the bright eyes of my inscrutable divinity
were leading me strangely out of my latitude.
Not that the sight of the dark blue waters inspired me
with the nausea so afflicting to the many,-- As nurses reprove
a squeamish child with the assurance that “people sick in
a carriage weren't born to ride in one,” — I am of opinion
that a sea-sick man was not born to sail in his own yacht;
and am proud to declare that the heaviest swell finds me
enjoying the robust health becoming a gentleman.
Still, the sea in December !- the Bay of Biscay at
Christmas!—The perils and inconveniences of the ensuing
fortnight were such as would have reconciled me, without
further argument, to find myself back again in poor
Hanover Square. La Bruyère, or some other of the
fellows whose sayings one is always remembering, observes
that a woman must be charming indeed whose husband
does not wish himself unmarried at least ten times a day.
So a sea-voyage must happen under circumstances peculiarly
favourable, if a man do not wish himself on dry land
forty-eight times in the course of the twenty-four hours.
I shall never forget the fervour of my thanks to Providence
when I found myself at length going it easy on the smooth
waters of the Tagus !
“His Majesty's service! – ” I could not of course
forget that I and my despatch-box were his Majesty's.
Though conscious that the magnet which drew me to the
shores of Portugal resided in a quinta at Cintra, I was
forced to go through the ceremony of delivering my des-
patches, my notes confidential, and a day's worth of private
explanation, to the individual and collective majesty of the
mission, before I even named the name of Barnet.
But how to do justice to the bore of being cross-
examined by an ambassador, a secretary, a private secretary,
and three attachés :- in the first place, concerning the
mysteries of their calling as connected with the fountain-
head in Downing Street ; and in the next, concerning all
that insignificant chit-chat of London, which becomes so
important the moment one gets out of earshot of its babble,

Next to the smell of the quays at Belem, and the spectacle
of their squalid population, the investigation I was com-
pelled to undergo was the most disgusting incident of my
arrival.
Let it not meanwhile be supposed that, at the mature
age of one-and-twenty, I was young enough to be beguiled
into precipitate inquiries in my turn. For worlds I would
not have evinced the slightest curiosity concerning anything
or anybody in Lisbon. Among my supercilious diplomatic
brethren, I chose to be better acquainted with all that was
going on at the seat of war, than Wellington or Beresford.
I was so good as to tell them what had been and would be
again; and described to them the state of parties in Lisbon,
with a graphic accuracy that obtained me unlimited credit.
No occasion to explain how much of my time had been
spent the preceding summer in company with those to
whom the welfare of Portugal was as vital air; and the
beauties of the Tagus a sacred recollection !
The rock of Lisbon was, in fact, scarcely more familiar
to me now that I had sailed under its clifted heights, or
the monastery of Mafra now that my eyes had rested upon
its majestic walls, than when described by the glowing
and eloquent partiality of Emily. Long before we dropped
anchor in the Tagus, I could have painted, as after a cir-
cumstantial sketch, the towers of St. Julien, and the castle
of Belem, — the white walls of the various quintas and
convents, peeping from among their gardens of evergreens,
- the imposing palace of the Ajuda --- the venerable portal
of St. Jeronymo -and the lofty towers of the mother
church, reflected upon the surface of the waters.
I could almost have wished myself fated to know them
only by description ; for Heaven knows the bright and
varied scene gained little by its accompaniments of sound
or smell. A more ill-favoured, ill-savoured community
than the rabble of the quays of Belem, is scarcely to be
imagined ; and for many days after my arrival, I was
tempted hourly to invoke as ideal the perfume of orange
trees and sound of guitars wherewith my romantic friends
had chosen to enliven their descriptions. The wrangling
of beggars, the grunting of pigs, and the bouquet of these

and other animaux immondes, such as barefooted friars,
appealed only too energetically to my patience.
My sense of smell is at all times painfully acute. The
least ostensibly developed, it is by no means the least
susceptible of the senses. Strange that we have no word
definitive of its imperfection or extinction ! — There are
the blind and the deaf, there are even the nearsighted and
the dunny ; but we want a name for those fortunate indi-
viduals who walk through a fishmarket or a glue manu-
factory, without wincing; or a thymy woodland or choice
conservatory, without rapture. For my own part, I pro-
test that my most vivid anticipation of the joys of Eden,
consists in the aromatic gales described by Milton, as
Able to cure all sadness but despair.
However excruciating the torture of my olfactory nerves
at Belem, I was nevertheless amply rewarded at a sub-
sequent period, when traversing some of those exquisite
valleys on the banks of the Mondego, shrubbed over with
lavender and rosemary, or balsamic thickets of the gum-
cistus; whose lofty baytrees, cypresses, or cedars, bathing
in intense sunshine, impart an almost Oriental spiciness
to the atmosphere. But I had much to undergo in the
interval. My irritability, after three days spent at an
Hotel reeking with garlic and tobacco, and enlivened
eighteen hours of the twenty-four by the incessant drum-
ming and fifing of a military parade, was the precursor of
illness. I had often known sea voyages produce the most
deleterious effects upon the constitution, when they fail to
affect it in the usual manner; but in my own instance,
I apprehended nothing. Never having experienced an
hour's ill-health, I scoffed at the idea of sickness; and
for the first three or four days after landing, attributed
my disorder to change of climate, change of food, or
fatigue.
I felt almost insulted when advised to see the embassy
physician. I was still more angry when the said phy-
sician, having been peremptorily introduced into my room
by one of the attachés, talked of bleeding and chicken-
broth! My indignation, however, was to little purpose;

157
for, three days afterwards, the ignominy of a tonsured
head was inflicted upon me, without my being conscious
of the offence ! Instead of making my way to Cintra, I
became delirious; in imminent danger from the paroxysms
of a bilious fever!
Poor Lady Ormington !-How little had she suspected
when, in our farewell interview, she bade me beware of
the plague and yellow fever, that her darling was carrying
with him the germ of a disorder equally perilous ! There
was every chance that instead of marmozets and Lisbon
chains, the packet which conveyed back to England intel-
ligence of our safe arrival would also carry news I was
sleeping my last sleep in the church-yard of Saint
Jeronymo.
If it had, I very much doubt whether any of them
would have cared. I was spared all efforts of sensibility
on that or any other point ; for during the ensuing three
weeks my mind was in a state of torpor. I knew not even
that I suffered ; though, judging from the result, my
sufferings must have been severe ; for when my danger
ceased my weakness was as that of a child.
One of my first impressions was a painful consciousness
that, though thus thrust among strangers to sicken, and all
but die, I had experienced as much sympathy and kindness
among them, as I should have done among my own
people, and in my father's house. This is a confession,
by the way, which people are apt to make as a reflexion
upon their relations, whereas it disgraces only themselves.
It is a case of rare misfortune when we are not loved by
our nearest of kin, in proportion as we desire and deserve
to excite affection. As to me, — but on this head I have
enabled my readers to judge for themselves.
The most imaginative bard of my time, he whose poetry
may be considered as the matrix of that of Byron, has
favoured us, by way of psychological curiosity, with a
picture of one of his dreams, the result probably of opium,
which a recent traveller * has declared to be so exact a
transcript of the scenery viewed from Mount Lebanon,
* Lord Lindsay.

that, when halting under the hoary cedars of the antique
world, he could find no truer description of the landscape
before him than the celebrated verses of Coleridge.
Are we to infer that to the inspired brain of the poet, that
Oriental beatitude was literally manifested ? « There are
more things in Heaven and earth than were dreamt of” in
the philosophy of Horatio. But there are more things in the
human mind than were dreamt of even by Hamlet — even
by Shakspeare. — May there not even exist senses still im-
perfectly defined by physiological science ? May there pot
be mysteries of the soul still undeveloped, indicated only
by the divining rod of the initiated, a mockery to the
learned, but of profound conviction to more delicate organi-
zations conscious of magnetic influences, — such as might
be esteemed a supernatural visitation, did aught in our frail
and miserable nature intitle us to communication with the
invisible world ? -
I can have no object in deceiving myself or others; and
I swear that during my illness at Belem my chamber was
haunted! I solemnly protest that no spot or scene I ever
visited in health and strength, is more vividly impressed
upon my memory than the realms in which I seemed to
live and move and have my being, during the period in
which my physicians pronounced me to be labouring under
mental excitement. To me, Portugal was still terra incog-
nita. My experience of the landscape scenery of my own
country was of the most prosaic nature; Ormington Hall,
situated in the ugliest county in England, - Oxford -
Putney. I had seen nothing, I knew nothing ; nor had
even art done aught to expand or refine my ideas of the
picturesque. Claude and Poussin, Salvator and Ruysdael,
had spread their transcript of the beauties of nature vainly
before my eyes. All I knew was, that the prevailing colour
of a landscape is green, and that the prevailing colour of a
sky had better be blue.
But the existence I seemed to lead at the time when all
was seeming, lay in a land whose acclivities were clothed
with the pale foliage of the olive; whose rivers ran among
over-topping wildernesses of canes and reeds; whose lofty
bay-trees extended their deep, fragrant, glossy, glorious

growth like the tree of which David sang in his hour of
inspiration ; whose rocks were overshowered with the pink
blossoms of the oleander, or the blue and vaporous bloom
of the rosmarinus ; whose rich groups of cork-trees,
through which the gleam of marble aqueducts appeared in
the distance, afforded shade from the noontide heat to
droves of buffaloes ; whose bamboo fences were surmounted
by the spiky leaves of the aloe and entwined with convol-
vuli of very different hue from those of my poor old blue
chambér in Hanover Square !
Was this prescience ? - Was the influence of the land
already strong upon my spirit ? — Was the companionship
that appeared to haunt me in those peculiar and well-
remembered scenes, also a delusion? — Were the words
breathed in my ears by her who appeared to be ever
present with me, words of warning ? - I dare not dwell
upon these speculations! I am aware that, in this age of
grovelling materialism, everything savouring of a pretence
to higher sources of intelligence is condemned as the
impertinence of a fool or the vagary of a madman. Perhaps
I was mad. I will even admit that I was mad. But this
I know, that I would exchange the more rational moments
of my existence for a single day or night of that stage of
lunacy, which seemed to transport me to the banks of the
limpid Mondego, “ with one fair spirit for my minister.”
So conscious was I even then of the ridicule attached
to my faith in this “supernatural soliciting,” that my
first inquiry on my restoration to health regarded the
degree to which my exclamations might have betrayed
my secret during my illness. I interrogated my nurse.
I questioned poor, faithful Tim, who had lain day and
night like a dog at my bedside. I challenged, with a
smile, my young friends of the embassy. But in vain.
The Portuguese nurse and Irish groom admitted that I
had raved like a man possessed; but they did not seem
to know whether by angel or devil. As to the attachés,
they talked about my being light-headed, but were not
much disposed to be at the trouble of knitting up the
ravelled skein of my perplexities.
All I knew with certainty was, that my restoration to

· health had snatched me from illusions worth an empire ;
and that the foul, filthy, sweltering, vermin-haunted,
yelling, drumming, strumming Belem which presented
itself before me in fetid reality, was a very inferior spot
to the city of Morisco convents and marble palaces, which
had risen out of the blue waters of the Tagus in my Land
of Thought.
Bales of letters had arrived for me by the packet,
during my illness ; Christmas bills, — reproaches on pink
paper, — and in black and white (from Messrs. Hanmer
and Snatch,) Lord Ormington's formal signification of his
displeasure that I should have solicited from Government
an appointment necessitating my absence from England,
precisely at a moment so fraught with interest to the Danby
family as the approaching marriage of my brother.
But this was not all. The pragmatical firm in South-
ampton Buildings, patented by his Right Hon. Lordship
with the privilege of lecturing me in his name, was further-
more pleased to intimate that, “ should my visit to Portugal
purport the renewal of my connection with a certain family,
which by their means had been casually introduced to my
acquaintance, they were instructed to inform me, that
my income would be peremptorily suspended on the
slightest intimation of anything tending to promote a nearer
alliance.”
A long shot, and wide of the mark ! - I had been more
than a month at Lisbon, without even attempting to obtain
information concerning the persons thus harshly pointed
out to my avoidance. I knew, indeed, that as regarded
the d’Acunhas, I might as well have walked to White-
chapel, inquiring all the way for a family of the name of
Smith; and with respect to Emily, felt a natural hesi-
tation about pointing her out to the notice of the young
gentlemen in kid gloves, who maneuvred the international
relations between England and Portugal.
Lisbon and its environs abounded at that time in Eng-
lish merchants. The sealing up or corking up of France,
rendered the fierce potations of Spain and Portugal our
sole resource against the humid climate of Great Britain.
I determined to defer my inquiries till I could visit Cintra

in person : — the prohibitions contained in the thirteen-
and-fourpenny epistle of Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch,
having served only to stimulate my impatience of the sick
room, and determine me upon attempting an airing, full a
fortnight earlier than the measure was sanctioned by that
remarkably obtuse body called the faculty.
CHAPTER II.
J'étudiais cette femme avec un culte égal à celui qu'apportent les peintres
devant les lignes pures et les chastes contours des Madones de Raphaël ou de
Cimabue. J'interrogeais en silence l'expression de son visage, afin de deviner
ce qui se passait en elle. J'écoutais le son de sa voix ; j'épiais un sourire,
je la regardais marcher. Que vous dirai-je ? C'était mon idole, la Madone
que je m'étais choisie.
ALPHONSE Bror.
Jucundum cùm ætas iorida ver ageret.
Catull. Epig. 67.
Few people pass through life without having experienced
the rapture of convalescence. Socrates has described the
delicious itching of the human flesh on the removal of
manacles, as worthy the endurance of bondage to appre-
ciate ; and it is quite as well worth while to be ill, for the
satisfaction of finding oneself well again. The transition
from the stagnant atmosphere of a sick room, from lugu-
brious faces and presages of evil, to the blessed and revivi-
fying light of day, with its snatches of fragrant breezes,
its “ lapse of streams and tune of birds,” is like a foretaste
of heaven.
Above all, I had every plea for exultation on finding
myself for the first time transported beyond the confines
of that fair-looking and foul-smelling capital of the land of
oranges and lemons. I, who had come so far,— who had
defied my father and his solicitors, — my creditors and
their accounts,- for the sole object of looking once more
upon the most angelic of human faces, had indeed cause
to murmur against the captivity which beset me on my
arrival, and to triumph in my enfranchisement.
To attempt an excursion to Cintra on the first day, or
on every one of the early days of returning health, was of

course impossible. Mais tout vient à point pour qui sait
attendre. In a week, I might push my excursions as far
as the Richmond of Lisbon. Cintra was not about to
move from its pedestal. In a week, I might hold the
hand of Emily in mine!
I am ashamed to say how many days that week ap-
peared to contain ! - From the moment I felt sure of our
approaching re-union, my impatience was redoubled. I
felt as if the yearning of my heart must kill me, unless
speedily gratified. All the wild imaginings of my dreams
had only stimulated my ardour. I began to appreciate
the excellence of Emily as I had never understood it be-
fore. The earnestness of her character, - its truthfulness
- its cordiality ; — the total absence of pretension or pre-
tence, were merits which my familiar acquaintance with
the artificialities of the world rendered doubly attractive.
I cannot understand how men of sense and feeling become
enthralled by women whom they never see betray a natural
emotion, or hear avow an honest sentiment. To me, no
charm so irresistible as the society of persons in whose faces
are reflected the mutations of their minds, and whose re-
marks and replies arise out of the genuine impulses of the
heart. I felt sure, for instance, that on entering Emily's
presence, I should learn at once, either from her expansive
smiles or cold severity, whether she resented my conduct;
or whether her sudden departure from England had been
equally a source of grief to her and to myself.
For I could not disguise to myself that, though an un-
avowed lover, I had spared no pains to recommend myself
to her regard ; that my attentions were such as should
never have existed or never ceased to exist ; and was re-
solved that, should I discover her regrets to have been as
poignant as my own, I would not again sacrifice to worldly
ambition, a treasure which the hand of Providence seemed
to have placed expressly in my path. She should be mine,
or — I had not yet exactly fixed upon the alternative.
While placing her before me in the character of an
affianced bride, I retouched in my memory the picture of
her bright and beaming beauty; a picture that might have
served as the image of youth or the type of sprirg, — so

163
unrivalled was its freshness — so pure its colouring — SO
rounded its contours — so vivid its brilliancy! I often sat
dwelling on the recollection of Emily, till I could have
sworn that she was visibly present-my idol,- my love,
my wife! How I had wronged her, how wronged myself,
not to have snatched her to my heart, long, weary months
ago under that endearing designation, instead of leaving
her exposed to the animadversions of the world! –
Spring was breaking ere my convalescence was suffi-
ciently advanced to admit of extending my drives. For
some time, indeed, the physicians insisted on my not ven-
turing out unaccompanied. Either the nature of my ex-
citement or the suddenness of my former attack, rendered
them cautious. At length, I was sufficiently strong to
defy them.
“ You may burn your books, my dear doctor !” said I
to my kind attendant, on the day of my purposed expedi-
tion to Cintra. “I have better remedies in store than the
forests of cascarilla you are inflicting on me. Within a
week, I premise you I shall be no longer the same man.
You will not know me. At all events, I shall disdain to
know you, and pass you by as the summer wind, which
you regard not.”
“ So much the better,” cried Dr. A- , “so much
the better! But I had rather you did not threaten me
with so bright an eye, or so hurried a pulse. I have been
writing a flourishing account of your amendment to-day,
by Sir Charles's desire, to Lord Ormington. Unless you
lower your tone, sir, I will recal my bulletin till the next
packet.”
I did not think it necessary to inquire of the official
Esculapius whether he had addressed his intelligence to his
lordship through the medium of Southampton Buildings;
in short, I was too happy at that moment to trouble my-
self about kith or kin. I had done like the gods invoked
by Nat. Lee in his tragedy, — “annihilated both time
and space to make two lovers happy.” I had even over-
come something more indomitable than time or space, —
my own listless nature, - my own coxcombry! I had
braved the perils of earth and sea, the displeasure of Ha- /

nover Square, and the fury of the bay of Biscay, in order
to enjoy once more the intercourse of that brightest of
human beings, — refined gold amid the baser metals of
society!
Beautiful Cintra ! — how I rejoiced to recognize in its
rocky pinnacles all that Emily had so often described !-
Two images seemed before me as we slowly ascended the
calcada of that region of quintas; - the sunny reality,
with its white walls dotted amid glossy verdure, and the
picture imprinted on my imagination by the gentle voice
so dear to me. Twofold enjoyment seemed to surround
me.
Oh! that odoriferous breath of gardens ! — that vitality
in the air, as of the young-eyed spring bursting into life
and joy through a thousand blossoms ! -I bore the bur-
then of life too lightly as I reached the first shrubby steep
of Cintra, and looked up to the rocky heights crowned by
the convent towers of Nossa Senhora da Penha ! My heart
was blithe as) a bird. I was something better than Cecil
Danby at that moment. I was a human being created to
be happy and confer happiness ; on the point of sharing
my joyous thoughts and feelings with a being still more
nobly constituted.
I inquired — that is, my Portuguese attendant inquired
of a young vinhateiro, whom we met trudging down the
hill with a pole slung across his shoulder, and a modinha
upon his lips, in strict accordance with the season and the
scene, whether he could direct us to the quinta of an Eng-
lish gentleman at Cintra.
“Inglese?” cried he, after the usual courteous “ Viva !”
of his country. - There are so many English. There is
the general, — there is the commissary general, — there is
the surgeon general, — there are twenty others who have
quintas on the hill.”
“No - it was not a gentleman connected with the
army."
“A fidalgo, then?”
“ No! not a fidalgo, — an old settler, — a merchant.”

gladsome countenance, as if the name had a cheering in-

fluence, as connected with goodness and beneficence.
“ Nossa Senhora! Who does not know the quinta of
Sans José !” —
And he seemed to take pleasure in directing the coach-
man the number of turns to the right and left which were
to convey us to the spot. Our progress was between stone
walls, overtopped by the verdure of the ilex and the bay,
and intersected here and there by the gates of different
quintas, enabling the eye to penetrate into the interior of
their trimly gardens and orange orchards. But to me,
every foot of earth we traversed was holy ground. I
thought of her surprise, — her welcome, — her eyes vary-
ing perhaps from the flash of joy to softening tears, her
grateful recognition of all I had braved, all I had forsaken,
to prove myself worthy her regard. As we gradually ac-
complished the number of turns and twistings pointed out
by the vinhateiro, my breath came so short, my heart
beat so painfully, that I felt, if my expedition were of
much greater extent, I could not support the excess of my
emotion. A sad admission for a coxcomb, to be shaken
thus ! — But I was recovering from an illness of two
month's duration, and the inflictions of three physicians.
At length, we approached a gate of somewhat statelier
appearance than the preceding ones,—which I recognized at
once as that of San José by the peculiarity of a level grove
of evergreens surmounted by a single ancient cypress of
prodigious height, which constituted a landmark for the
neighbourhood. Emily had described this to me as the
first object that, a distance, would speak to her of home.
We were at the gate. The house, a modest mansion
of white stone, two stories in height, differed in no respect
from the neighbouring quintas, save in lying more exposed
to the road, — the whole façade being visible from the gates.
But of all the human abodes I ever beheld, it presented,
at that moment, the brighest aspect. The house was
surrounded with almond trees, in all their effulgence of
bloom. The air seemed actually brightened by the shower
of pink and white blossoms, thrown out into stronger
relief by the dark background of evergreens formed by a
lofty pine-grove to the rear of the quinta.

The white mansion on which the sun was pouring its
brightness, as if delighting to salute so fairy-like a scene,
encompassed by a wilderness of blossoms, looked like a fair
girl arrayed for her bridal. It was afternoon. The
nightingales, nowhere more mellifluous than on the shores
of the Tagus, were commencing their song in those glad.
some thickets. Just in such a sunshiny place could I
have desired to feast my eyes, once more, upon the smiling
face of Emily,
The gates were thrown open, but I would not let the
carriage drive in. I did not feel sufficiently authorized
in acquaintanceship to demand admittance. Two gentle-
men were sauntering on the broad gravel-walk under the
almond trees ; — elderly men,- one of them, probably,
the proprietor of the quinta.
Alighting from the carriage, I inquired of the porter
whether that were Mr. Barnet, — pointing towards the
gentlemen, one of whom had stopped short in his walk,
attracted by the jarring of the gates, and was looking
earnestly towards me; so earnestly, that on his answering
in the affirmative, I thought it better to hasten at once
towards him, and explain the object of my visit. Luckily
for my nervous tremours, he came forwards to meet
me.
" I have taken the liberty, sir,” said I, addressing the
old gentleman, hat in hand, with the most deprecating
politeness, “ to intrude upon you, in the hope that —”
" Is she coming ? —” demanded he, interrupting me,
in a whisper, as if apprehensive of being overheard by his
companion.
“ My name is Danby. I have not the honour of being
personally known to you,” said I, concluding that he
mistook me for some other person.
“ Is she coming ? —” he repeated, in precisely the
same tone, and keeping the same intense look of inquiry
fixed upon my face.
“You are under some mistake, I fear, sir," I replied,
beginning to fancy that I, too, must be in error. “ I had
the honour of being acquainted in England with your
daughter; and —”

s Is she coming ?”- again repeated the old man, in
precisely the same tone, and with a fixedness of aspect
that began to excite vague uneasiness in my mind. I
could scarcely doubt that I was addressing a person of
disturbed intellect: even before I perceived that the in-
dividual by whom he was accompanied on my entrance,
and who had now rejoined him, was making signs of
intelligence to me to desist from the conversation. All
the notice vouchsafed by Mr. Barnet to this interruption,
consisted in turning towards him with the same sort of
glaring scrutiny he had previously bestowed upon me,
and the reiteration of the same simple question, uttered
in the same stern whisper, — “ Is she coming ?”-
“ Presently, presently !” — replied his companion, in
the coaxing tone used to deceive children and maniacs.
“ But you have had a long walk, sir. Supposing we go
in and rest ourselves ? - This gentleman has promised that
he will come and visit you another time!”
“ Another time?”-muttered the old man, folding his
hands, and in a tone of deep despair. “It is always
another time!”-
Nevertheless he quietly took the arm extended towards
him by his companion, (who made signs to me to await
his return in the garden,) and submissively attempted a
few steps towards the house. In a moment, however, he
stopped, as if some new idea had entered his mind, and
returned suddenly towards me. “At least, before I go,
let him tell me whether she is coming ? ” — said he, in
precisely his former tone and manner. Then approaching
me and laying his hand familiarly on my arm, he inclined
his white face closer towards my ear to falter in a lower
whisper. " I will tell none of them, if you will let me
hear the truth.— You said you knew Emily. Is she -
is she coming ?-_”.
“ I had thought to find her here, sir,” said I, painfully
agitated, but not daring to refuse him an answer. “It is
many months since we met. I learned with satisfaction
her safe arrival in Portugal; the hope of meeting her,
indeed, was one of my inducements to visit Lisbon.'

search of her for me!” cried he suddenly, giving way
to a burst of passionate feeling. “You knew Emily, —
you valued her, .- perhaps, you loved her ? - But no 1 you
were not her father.—You would not love her as I loved
her.—You could not have found the cruel courage to send
her away from you, that she might be safe in happy
England, - safe from the terrors of war, - safe from the
ruin which is overwhelming Portugal and all belonging
to her. - Do you know how it fared with my girl, in
England ? — my beautiful girl, - my pride – my glory,
— the comfort of my old age !— They persecuted her,
- they vilified her, -- they killed her for me, sir! - The
curse of God light upon them in everlasting fire, for the
deed ! — They — they — but is she coming ?”- said he
suddenly dropping his infuriated accents into his former
tone, with a mild earnestness that made my flesh creep !-
« If you agitate yourself in this manner, Mr. Barnet,”
interposed his companion in a tone of authority betraying
the keeper, “ I shall not be able to allow you a walk in
the garden again to-morrow. You are distressing this
gentleman, a stranger to you.”
“ No! not a stranger!”– interrupted poor Barnet,
again laying his hand upon my arm. “I can see by his
face that he is no stranger. He is grieving for me, — he
is grieving for Emily !- He knows that it will be a long
time before they let my child come back to me again. -
You see he dares not answer me when I ask for her ! -
The way with you all !- No one, no one will say whe-
ther she is coming !-You told me your name just
now?”- cried he, stopping short, and again intently
regarding me.
“ Danby,- Cecil Danby! "
« I should know it, - I seem to know it, ” he ex-
claimed, shrugging his shoulders impatiently. “Somehow
or other, I forget everything now. Nothing seems to stay
with me. My girl would not stay with me. — Poor
Emily would not remain at San José. — They tell me I
shall see her again.-- But when !- Can you, tell me
when ? — you, sir !- Mr. Danby, - Englishman, — what
are you? Is she coming, I say !-- is she coming ?-"

- You had better retire, he is always thus excited in
the presence of strangers,” observed his companion, with
the insensibility of a person habituated to such scenes. " I
will rejoin you at the lodge, as soon as I have succeeded
in restoring him to composure.”
6 How dare you call any one a stranger who comes to
San José to demand hospitality in the name of my daugh-
ter? —” cried the old man, turning fiercely upon him.
“ Don't you know that Emily is still mistress here?
Don't you know that, when she comes back to me, her
first care will be to drive out of the house the brute who
has presumed to tyrannize over her poor old father, - to
beat me like a child, - me, a grey-headed man ! - She
loved me very dearly, sir," he continued, abruptly address-
ing me. “ Though she left me, she loved me very dearly.
-- Come with me into the house, and you shall see the
picture she drew of me. It is not finished, they say.-
There was not time to finish it, ere they took her from
me. But she is coming back to finish it; -- she ought to
have been here by this time. The flowers are come, you
see,” said he, pointing to the almond trees around us,
" and the birds are singing, - and the sun shining,
just as if Emily were here again. - Bright, bright !- it
is all so bright and beaming, that my poor head and my
heart ache with it. It is a very sad time the spring !-Is
she coming, sir, that you are here to meet her? — Ha!
ha! ha! We shall disappoint them yet. — They think
they have buried her. -- But I know better !- I know,-
I know that she is coming !”
He had now locked his arm fast in mine, and a
request was whispered to me, by his attendant, that
I would lend my assistance towards restoring him to
tranquillity, by accompanying him into the quinta. The
proposal was a welcome one, for my own strength was
failing me.
As we approached the house, the hall-door was thrown
open by two servants, who preceded us into a large
saloon, the jalousies of which were closed; so that, enter-
ing it from the dazzling sunshine, I could not, at first, dis-
tinguish the objects it contained. My first impulse was to

stagger to a seat. If the dreadful surmises excited by the
ravings of the poor maniac before me should be grounded
in truth! - If Emily should be really gone, – gone for
ever ! -
One word adressed to the keeper, who was standing at
only a few paces distance, would have determined the
matter. But I had not courage to give it utterance. I
had not courage to know the worst. A deathly faintness
came over me. I seemed to distinguish in the chamber
that peculiar perfume of vanille, so indicative of her pre-
sence. Like old Barnet, I could scarcely refrain from
exclaiming, in a frantic whisper, — "Is she coming ? -"
A few minutes afterwards, (I conclude that minutes only
had elapsed,) I found myself reclining in the same chair,
with a chilly sensation creeping over me; on one side, the
lunatic, with his unmeaning eyes peering into my face ;-
on the other the keeper, who was holding my hand in his,
as if feeling my pulse. — Great God! was he going to
exercise his horrible functions upon me? -
" He is recovering. I told you, Mr. Barnet, sir, that
you would harass him by your wild questions,” said the
man, addressing, in a surly tone, his unfortunate charge.
“ How can you expect that your friends will continue to
visit you, if you flurry and vex them in this manner ?”
“ He is not my friend. He is her friend. Her friends
will always be indulgent with me!” ejaculated the poor
old man ; and he leaned over me, with a look so piteous
that I struggled doubly hard to recover strength and
extricate myself from my dreadful position.
By degrees, my eyes accustomed themselves to the
gloom of the darkened chamber ; I could now perceive
that it contained a thousand indications of female habita-
tion. There were musical instruments,- books, — flowers.
There was an embroidery frame upon the table ; and a
lory chained to a stand, sidling restlessly to be noticed, as
if impatient of the darkness and stillness of the place. My
fears began to subside. Why had I listened to the inco-
herences of a madman ? - Emily was probably in the
house. - It was all I could do to refrain from demanding,
in my turn, of the keeper whether she were coming. -

The contagion seemed to have touched my brain. - At
length I rose feebly from my chair.“
“ These are Emily's books, — Emily's work,” – whis-
pered the poor old gentleman, leading me courteously to
the table. “ If she were here, sir, she would show them
to you, and sing to you, and bid you welcome. See !
there is the mark left in her favourite volume,” he
continued, showing me a sprig of withered myrtle placed
between the pages of Burns, a writer we had often, very
often, discussed and praised together. “It is so strange
that she does not come and finish all these things! People do
not leave their work incomplete, and their mark in a book,
week after week, in this way. I can't tell you how many
days have passed, sir, since I heard the sound of music in
this room. You know how she used to sing! Never was
there heard such a voice on earth! 'Nel silenzio !'-
did you ever hear her sing 'Nel silenzio ?' – Banti never
attempted it after she had heard my Emily. --- And now,
not a note ! — not a single note! — nothing, - nothing !
- So still that you may hear all day the clinking of poor
Yilko's chain. — I should send it away, but that it was
hers. The poor bird seems watching for her with me. -
Every one is watching for her. -"
I shuddered. I was beginning to feel an instinctive
horror of the concluding phrase so indicative of his be-
wilderment. — This time, he spared me. -
“ Supposing we go and look for her ? ” — cried he.
with a vacant smile, as if struck with a bright idea. “I
know where they took her, when she was carried away
from San José ; and if we were to go and call her, toge-
ther, very likely she might come back to us. Ask the
gentleman to accompany me. He will not, unless you ask
him. No one does anything here that you do not bid
them,” said he, addressing his keeper, with a significant
look.
- Will you promise me, sir, if we humour you, to
return quietly home, and take a few hours rest?” — was
the man's prudent reply : “ you know you have not closed
your eyes these two nights.”
“ Would you have had me sleep, when Emily had pro-

mised me a visitor ? ” — demanded poor Barnet, with one
of those cunning smiles peculiar to madmen. “But I
have welcomed him, you see, in spite of you. I have
shown him her books, — her flowers, — her bird; — and
now I will take him to her,- that is, if you will allow
me.”
“If you would so far indulge him, it would be an act
of charity,” said the keeper, drawing me aside. “ For
several days past, Mr. Barnet's paroxysms have been
dreadful. To-day he is more subdued ; and if I could
only bring him to shed tears, as he usually does after that
favourite walk, it would ensure him the comfort of a
night's sleep.”
“ I am myself, as you perceive, in so feeble a condi-
tion, — " I was beginning.
“ Feeble!” – interrupted the lunatic, who was eagerly
listening. “No matter ! - You shall lean on my arm. -
I will support you. — We will go together and visit
Emily. — It is but a step. — Allan, the key ! - You are
a good fellow, though brutal. You shall come with us.
There, — softly! — don't hurry yourself, Mr. - What
did you say was your name ? — Danby? Don't hurry
yourself. She will wait for us. — She was always so
good, — so patient. I never heard her chide so much as
a dog! She will wait — she will wait. -".
And continuing to mutter praises of his daughter, he
led me through a suite of rooms, the keeper closely follow-
ing; one of which, from various articles of female attire
lying about, as well as from a peculiar look of neatness and
elegance, I concluded to be the chamber of Miss Barnet.
“ She is not here, you see !” said the old man, pausing
a moment, opposite to the cold white bed. “ She loved
this room, though. — Look!- there is her father's picture
hanging to the wall, - opposite to the spot where, when
she was a little, little child, she used to kneel down night
and morning, and pray to God to bless him. — No one
ever prays here for me now. - God has forsaken the
house ! - Ichabod! My glory has departed !-".
" You promised, sir, to take this gentleman to visit
her," interposed the keeper, discerning symptoms of grow-

173
ing excitement, connected, I suppose, with the spot. —
« You must not break your word.”
" Who talked of breaking my word ? - Am I not a
gentleman still ? - My daughter has forsaken me. — The
French have burned my stores, — have ravaged my vine-
yards, — have ruined me, - have devastated Portugal. —
But I am a gentleman, I hope, for all that. — Don't hurry
me, Allan ; — you know I cannot bear being hurried ! -
I- I am a gentleman. I never thought of breaking my
word.” —
And with stealthy footsteps, he made his way out of
the room, and attempted to open the glass-doors of a small
adjoining vestibule that seemed to communicate with the
garden. Allan immediately took a key from his pocket,
and enabled us to pass ; then, after traversing a long
gravel walk, skirted on either side by wall-like espaliers of
closely shaven myrtle, cut into fanciful arcades, we reached
the extremity of the garden ; and again, the keeper pro-
duced his pass key, and unlocked the postern door of a
boundary wall.
We were now in an orange grove; a spot of little
interest in the eyes of any inhabitant of Portugal, to whom
the aspect of the glossy verdure, golden fruit, or snowy
and richly scented blossoms of that Hesperian tree, are as
uninteresting as an apple-orchard to ourselves.
But it happened to be the first realization to my eyes of
a scene so often and so vividly described by Emily, in
association with the scenes and sports of her childhood.
« This was her play-ground, sir," — said old Barnet,
pointing among the smooth stems of the venerable trees,
proud with the burthen of their golden treasures, -" and
yonder ”
At that moment, Allan unlocked a third door in the
exterior wall, and I found myself in a small green enclosure,
the turf of which, rising here and there into mounds of a
peculiar form. — But why describe all this? —
The old man led me slowly, reverently, and silently, to
the remotest corner of the little enclosure ; over which, the
boughs of a fine bay-tree, overhanging from the gardens of
the quinta, extended their shade.—There was a stone slab

of
on the ground ;—placed there very recently, — for the
rough clay around it had not yet attained a vestige of
verdure, and a few displaced sods still lay withering
around.
“ This, as you are probably aware, sir, is the English
burying-ground,” said Allan, breathing his hateful whisper
confidentially into my ear. “I am not often able to
indulge him with a visit.—I dare not bring him here alone.
Look !"
The poor old man was down on his knees, with his
head bowed upon the stone, — tracing with his trembling
finger the letters engraven there :-
Pray for the Soul
EMILY BARNET,
Aged eighteen years.
Died on the 17th of February, 1811.
Ora pro me.
Only three weeks in the grave !—The earth scarcely
closed over that beloved face !-Oh! misery- misery ! -
Had I hastened to San José on my disembarkation, I had
been in time to save her,—to spare the shattered reason of
her wretched father !— Why — why thus tardy in my
atonement ?
For she had died of a broken heart.-—That which the
keeper, Allan, called a rapid decline, was the anguish of a
broken heart. I heard all, soon afterwards, from the
worthy man whose aid was now once more called in to
rescue me from the grave. He had attended her. He
had been her friend,- her confidant. Having detected a
moral influence as the origin of her disorder, she had
owned to him on her death-bed, that her sudden return to
Lisbon was caused by the infamous rumours spread con-
cerning her in England, by a noble family, who, resenting
the attentions she had received from one of its members,
had sacrificed her reputation without remorse,
« The spiritless man whom my father had appointed
my guardian," murmured the dying girl, - forsook his
charge in the dread of these people’s displeasure. He sent
me from his house ;—he even dared to accuse me of
levity,—of duplicity,- of shame !—But that was not all.

He - he for whose sake I bore all this, - he, by whose
unmanly boasts I was exposed to such indignity,-he, too,
shunned me in my disgrace.-He deigned not so much as
make one inquiry after her whom he had thus ungratefully
injured ! – But no matter ! - May God forgive him, as
I do!” —
When this was told me, I felt that not even the prayers
of that sinless being could procure me the pardon of
Heaven! Tears flowed from the eyes of my kindly
attendant, as he adverted to her touching death-bed. All
human skill had been unavailing.–She refused to be com-
forted— she disdained to live ;- but expired in peace and
charity with all men — a saint - a martyr! -
By a strange coincidence, he had closed her eyes on the
very night he was first summoned to attend me. Two
hours after witnessing the departure of that tortured spirit,
he had hastened to my bedside. He had scarcely resigned
her clay-cold hand, when my burning one claimed his
ministry in its place !-
And I had known nothing of all this !--I, who had
come so far but for the delight of beholding her again, had
heard the passing bell toll for Emily,- had seen mourning
worn for her, -had- But no matter -
From that day,

scribbler may have to add a single gloomy shade to the
direful dolefuls with which nature has encompassed poor
human nature.
Most writers seem to have a predilection for the dismal
side of things. Historians are sure to dismiss a golden
age in half a dozen lines; yet when they come to a bloody
war and a sickly season, to sieges, battles, a drought, a
famine, the plague, the cholera, — see how they run on !
- What flowing periods !—what high-sounding epithets !
— Decidedly the author-itative classes have a leaning to-
wards the unsunny side of events.
For myself, be it plainly understood, my only motive
for alluding to this melancholy episode at all, is to excuse
to the world what might otherwise appear an unpardonable
act of folly ; - my having volunteered to join the brigade
of Beresford ; and having fought through the remaining
three years of the Peninsula war, as ferociously as if born
the seventh son of a Welsh curate, with an ensigncy in a
marching regiment.
I have no ambition to pass for a fighting-man. I do
not want to impose myself on the world as a hero. It is
necessary, therefore, to explain, not only that I came, saw,
and conquered — but why I came at all. — Vain were the
remonstrances of my brethren of the corps diplomatique ;
vain the indignant letters of Lord Ormington, calling upon
me to return instantly to England, on pain of disinheri-
tance. Though on that occasion, and for once, he ad-
dressed me with his own hand, I was steadfast in my
purpose. I cared nothing for his threats. I cared no-
thing for my future fortunes. To have confronted Lon-
don, - cold heatless London, - London, to whose scan-
dals Emily had laid down the sacrifice of her life,– would
have been greater torture to me than condemnation to the
gallies.
My object was to die, - speedily, - bravely; and so
escape the guilt of the suicide, or the degradation of in-
sanity. I will not attempt to describe the self-reproaches
called forth by the unwitting revelations of my good doctor.
When that heavy blow overtook me, I was in no condition
to wrestle with affliction. The only wonder is, that I pre-

served sufficient strength and reason to seek out an honour-
able career as the termination of my sorrows.
More people, however, expect to die of grief than fall
victims to the poignancy of their sensibility. I was not
an Emily Barnet. I was only Cecil Danby, the coxcomb!
- After a few months' desperate service, after volunteering
in every rash attempt, – leading a forlorn hope or two, -
and fording a river or so under the enemy's fire, - new
desires presented themselves. I still wished to die ; but
to die the death of the glorious. I hoped that a laurel
might wave over my tomb, as a bay-tree over that of
Emily. I trusted that, though my days were not be long
in the land, the fame of them might survive me
The man who cherishes a strong ambition, of whatever
nature, is in no immediate danger of dying of a broken
heart. At the close of the year, instead of having accom-
plished my promises to myself or to the memory of the
dead, I was alive, strong, vigorous, - a good soldier, —
almost a good man !
Not a fellow at Watier's would have owned my ac-
quaintance. All that coat, hat, or boots could do to dis-
grace a gentleman I was undergoing at the hands of mine.
Ragged, - patched,—wayworn, — sunburnt,— who would
have guessed in me the creature of the cockade, — the
fribble of the convolvulus hangings, — the pet of Lady
Harriet Vandeleur, — the darling of the Right Hon. Lady
Ormington ? -
Be pleased, dear public, on arriving at the conclusion of
the last paragraph, to conceive me, placing my pen behind
my ear and my considering cap on my head, to determine
whether or not I shall fight my battles in Spain or Por-
tugal o'er again for your amusement. I am conscious that
I could tell you a thing or two you have never heard be-
fore. I have got some terrible winter fireside stories,
concerning sackings of convents and burnings of churches,
the desecration of my lord abbot's cellar, and my lady ab-
bess's oratorium ; but, in my opinion, the pipeclay novel-
ists have taken the shine out of all that sort of thing.
Since people took to writing about the Peninsula cam-
paigns, nobody believes a word one says, when one begins

to twaddle about one's conquests. When Gleig opened
the trenches with his “ Subaltern,” indeed, the ground
was unbroken and smelt wooingly, like all freshly turned
earth. But now, it is the disturbed mould of a church-
yard.
Besides, when one wants to embroider a little in one's
narrative, as heroes and autobiographers are apt to do, one
gets so abominably brought to book by those confounded
military periodicals, — United Service Journals and Naval
and Military Magazines, — that there is no standing it!
Were I to attempt a sketch of the storming of St. Sebas-
tian's, for instance, or the hateful business at Bayonne, I
should be having platoons of letters fired at me and my
publisher, from “Fair Play,” or “ An old Soldier,” for
the next six months ; and, perhaps, have to fight some
fire-eating Irish major at the end of the correspondence.
All things considered, therefore, (and having come to
this determination, I take the pen from behind my ear
again,) permit me to parenthesize my years of heroism.
I beg you to believe me valiant as Lieutenant-general
Sir Hurlothrumbo Pipeclay, K. C. B., or the God of war
or Tom Thumb, or any other great commander, or knight-
commander ; and release me from the task of playing
commentator on my own Cæsarianisms.
Joking apart, there have been worse soldiers than I was,
for a man born without any natural genius for fighting.
Recollect that I was enlisted in the cause only by the
accidental twirling of the wheel of fortune !— At Eton,
the regimentals of the Guards, as they amused themselves
at cricket in the Windsor Park, had determined my juvenile
inclinations towards the army, in its least martial form ; and
then, the negative of the governor and the governor's lady
had sufficed to defeat my intentions. Now, when I had
literally enlisted for fighting's sake, without heed of a uni-
form, or thought of promotion, not even the threat of dis-
inheritance could turn me from my purpose. There must
have been a fate in all this ; or I, the slave of Southamp-
ton Buildings and drudge of Downing Street, should never
have found myself thanked for my services after the action
of Toulouse ; which, according to competent authorities,

had the singular fortune to be gained by the English
under Wellington, the French under Soult, and the Por-
tuguese under the Hon. Cecil Danby. But this last little
piece of bragging, is an interchange of especial confidence
betwixt myself and my readers.
Three years, — three years of peril and privation, —
elapsed between my landing at Belem and our triumphal
hoisting of the drapeau blanc in the good city of Bour-
deaux. I cared little for the restoration of the Bourbons ;
- who did, — of all those who devoted their blood and
breath in the peninsula to that memorable cause ? - My
feeling was the general feeling of the army, — to put
down the French, -- to drive the French back again into
their territories, — to bind them down, – to confine their
ambition to the country wherein it was their pleasure to
decapitate a king and queen one day, as a punishment for
the crime of being a king and queen, and create new sove-
reigns the next, to be dethroned on the third ; just as if,
after destroying a nest of serpents, one were to thrust their
eggs into the sunshine, for the perpetuation of the race.
Nevertheless, in common with some fifty thousand other
blockheads, no sooner was the White flag flying, than I
chose to fancy we had been fighting solely for the purpose
of placing a fat, greedy, infirm old gentleman upon the
throne, in place of an active, temperate, and enterprising
one; and, satisfied with having laid Napoleon on the shelf
at Elba, began to fraternize with the French nation, en
gros et en détail. During the week spent at Bourdeaux,
previous to my embarkation for England, I had swallowed
more oysters, perpetrated more conquests among the gri-
settes of the Allée de Tournon, and converted more Napo-
leons into Breguet watches, dozens of gloves, boxes of eau
de Cologne, and extrait de millefleurs, than any other
numskull in the British army, or its auxiliaries.
La Rochefoucault has had the audacity to say that there
are “ peu d'honnêtes femmes qui ne soient lasses de leur
métier ;” a sentence which has caused the prudes of suc-
cessive centuries to bristle up their quills. I shall, perhaps,
provoke a similar porcupinism on the parts of the heroes
of my native country, by avowing my belief that few

soldiers, in war time, but are equally sick of their calling.
It is not danger and death by which they are disgusted,
but privation and fatigue; and, above all, the caprices of
those « drest in a litttle brief authority," upon whose
tempers, harassed by privation and fatigue, depend the
minor grievances of the march or the garrison.
I am free to confess that never was I better pleased than
on throwing aside the harness of war. My pride had
yoked me to its endurance, so long as the bubble reputation
floated before the cannon's mouth ; but I quite agreed with
the allied armies that it was time for those brazen rascals
to close their mouths; and, early in the month of May,
one of his Majesty's transports landed me at Portsmouth,
twenty times more eager for home and its enjoyments,
than when released from Eton and all its birch.
How completely the ways and habits of Hanover Square
were razed from the tablets of my brain, was sufficiently
proved by the fact that I rattled up to the door, in my
postchaise, no whit ashamed either of my plebeian vehicle,
my ill-cut coat, my execrable Bourdeaux hat with its
voluted brim, or the bronze face it pretended to shade.
After three years' absence, I felt privileged to be as un-
couth and ill-favoured as I pleased.
Some months had elapsed since I had communicated
with home. There was nothing to encourage me to
punctual correspondence. My mother's letters, which
were short without being sweet, rarely contained more than
a bulletin of her own and Bibiche's ailings; and every now
and then, a fresh outburst of reproaches at my having
flung aside all consideration for my name and condition,
and embarked in a branch of service in which I was never
likely to be heard of. She even persisted in addressing her
letters to the Honourable Cecil Danby, after I had
attained the brevet rank of a field officer.
Other correspondents I had none. The bitterness of
misanthropy into which I had fallen, after the painful
event which seemed to divide me from social life as com-
pletely as though I had taken the vows of a Trappist, left
me no inclination to hear more of the London world than
was to be gleaned from the newspapers which occasionally

reached us. Nay, it had actually been news to me to read
in one of those polite intelligencers, at Bourdeaux, an
account of the festivities at Ormington Hall, in honour of
the christening of my brother's son and heir. My brother
officers jested with me upon what they called my crest-
fallen face, on discovering that I no longer figured as second
in heirship to the title and estates. Yet Heaven knows
that no slighter thread could exist, than the tie which
united me with any member of the Danby family!
Nevertheless, on re-approaching the old mansion in
Hanover Square, some natural emotions came choking to
my throat. I had quitted it so suddenly, - so unadvisedly,
- so like a thief in the night, and had since experienced
such bitter resentment against its inmates, that I dreaded
the moment of our meeting. I almost wished I had
written from Bourdeaux, or even Portsmouth, to announce
my coming. But I had been deterred by the apprehension
of seeming to bespeak the killing of the fatted calf, in
honour of one who formed such slender pretensions to the
tenderness of the family.
When the chaise rattled up to the door, a disagreeable
presentiment forewarned me that something was amiss.
But it was not for me to trust to presentiments. Had I
not entered the quinta of San José with my heart fluttering
with joy, — like a bridegroom - like an enfranchised
slave – like all that is most exulting among the children
of clay!
At all events, there was no achievment over the door ;
no emblazonment intermingling the monsters of heraldry
with skulls and cross-bones, to proclaim to the passing
mechanic that an ennobled corpse was gone down to the
worms. But since my father and mother were still alive,
for whom was worn the black array that met my eyes as
the hall door was thrown open ? In whose honour
gloomed those sable liveries with their black aiguillettes,
- a lugubrious contrast with the well powdered-heads of
Lady Ormington's standard footmen.
Neither the butler nor his delegates were known to
me by sight; for Lady Ormington, like most ladies
curious in lapdogs, was hard to please in the article

of her slaveys. They were always too slow or too fast; or
they snorted, or snuffled, or were guilty of some other
human infirmity. The three fellows who stood staring
at my postboy, being unknown to me, I was necessarily
a stranger to them; and as there was little to command
respect in the discoloured valise and dressing-box strapped
to the dickey of that least imposing of all four-wheeled
equipages, a yellow chaise having a wooden cross on its
green glass windows, and “licensed to deal in post-
horses," on the rail, — I had no reason to be indignant
at the air of supercilious amazement with which these
well-dressed, well-disciplined varlets surveyed me, when
I bad them assist in uncording the luggage.
" I beg your pardon, sir, - but pray is my Lord
expecting you ?”- inquired the butler, while the two
standards gazed at each other for an explanation, -- which
neither was likely to afford.
“ Be so good as to pay the man and see the valise
taken off,” — said I, not altogether aware of the perplex-
ities I was exciting.
“ This is Lord Ormington's, sir, — number eighteen ;
- I fancy there is some mistake,” persisted the butler,
bowing back towards the house, and evidently about to
close the door in my face.
“I will thank you to have my luggage carried up to
my room, sir,- to Mr. Cecil Danby's room,~” said I,
by way of explanation.

tion, as I prepared to jump out, attributing his dismay to
remorse for his ungenerous reception of his master's
son returning from the perils and dangers of foreign
service.
“ Is Lady Ormington at home ? ” — said I, following
him nimbly up the steps.
« Shut the vestibule door, John.— Shut the vestibule
door!”- cried the butler in an authoritative tone, when
he found himself tête-à--tête with me in the hall. “ Shut
all the doors !”-And instead of replying to my question,
he proceeded to whisper in the ear of the said John a
message, in which I thought I could distinguish the words

Marlborough Street and Bow Street runner.— It was clear
that my identity was a matter of suspicion.
“ You seem to entertain some hesitation about admitting
me? --” said I: “excusable enough; for you are all
new since I quitted England. But there must surely be
some person left in the household who can identify my
person ? "
“ Young man," said the butler, whose mind was run-
ning upon his plate chest, “it is a massiful thing for us
all that the family happened to be in town to defeat your
nefarous pupposes. I am under the necessity of keeping
you in custody till, -"
“ Blockhead !-" cried I, out of all patience, “I tell
you again that I am Colonel Danby,— Lord Ormington's
younger son!”-
Hiş reply was an insolent laugh, echoed, of course,
by his familiars, John and Thomas. He even added
something about his eye, which would be no ornament to
these pages.
“As we happen to be in mourning, my fine fellow,
for the only son as ever my Lord had, with the 'ception
of Mr. Danby the memberoparlment, – ” John was
beginning.
“In mourning-in mourning for me? --_" cried I, in
spite of all my irritation bursting into a laugh. “And
where was I killed, pray ? - Stay, - as you appear to be
a more idiotic one than the other, beg Mrs. Ridley, the
housekeeper, 10 walk this way, or Mademoiselle Aglaé,
if still with Lady Ormington.— Even Bibiche would
recognize me, and set your minds at ease.”
Something in the decision of my tone, I suppose, con-
vinced them that I was a man having authority ; for
Mrs. Ridley was instantly summoned, and, albeit, little
in the habit of toddling out of her still-room, made her
appearance smelling of lemon-peel, cinnamon, and ratafia
cakes, as English housekeepers are wont to do when
disturbed in the afternoon, during the organization of
their second course.
I spare my readers the recapitulation of her ejaculations,
varying from horror to wonder, — delight, — ecstacy.--

At one time, her joy threatened hysterics ; and hysterics
from fourteen stone and a half, avoirdupoise, is a serious
affair. Suffice it, that under the housekeeper's authority
and a double battery of apologies from the butler and co.
I was removed into the dining-room, my valise admitted
into the hall, and the postchaise dismissed.
“ How ever we shall be able to break it to my lady,
is more nor I can take it on myself to say !”- sobbed
the fat housekeeper. “ To be sure, Mr. Cecil, how my
lady did take on when you was returned missing, and soon
a'ter’ards killed !-And now she'll take on again every bit
as bad, to learn as you be still alive and well ! - Bless your
soul, sir,” she continued, drawing aside her white apron
to display her bombazine, " we've been in mourning for
you this month or more ; my crape's a-beginning to be
a-rusty. I'm sure I don't know who'll dare speak about
it to my lady, till Miss Richardson comes in.”
“ And who the deuce is Miss Richardson ?”— cried I.
“ Lor', Mr. Cecil, sir, pray have a care, or the men
might hear you !— Nothing's done in this house now,
without Miss Richardson, sir. Miss Richardson is my
lady's companion, sir, — what Ma’mselle Aglae calls her
dam' d'honour.”
Poor Ridley pronounced the word so singularly, that
in spite of the solemnity of her bombazine, I laughed
outright.
“ And when is this dam' d'honour' likely to make her
appearance ?” said I, “for I am impatient to be admitted
to your Lady, and learn the latest particulars of my
decease.”
We were interrupted by one of the footmen bursting
into the room, with outcries for the housekeeper and sal-
volatile. The new butler, without much faith, apparently,
in her ladyship’s sensibility, having walked straight to her
dressing-room door and announced the visit of her lady-
ship’s dead son, as coolly as he would have done that of
her apothecary.
“ Since the mischief's done, sir, maybe you 'd better
come up with me at once,” said Ridley ; and scarcely
knowing whether to laugh or cry, I followed her into the

presence of my mother. The room smelt powerfully of
burnt feathers. Why they had been committed to the
flames, I can scarcely take on myself to say ; for certes I
never saw any one further from a fainting fit than Lady
Ormington. She reclined in her fauteuil, indeed, with
her arms pendent over its arms; but her two cheeks were
as red as pomegranates, or as Mademoiselle Martin's
végétal superfin.
“ Was there ever anything so shameful as the careless-
ness of the War Office, my dear Cis!”-cried she, as soon
as I had convinced her by an embrace that I was sub-
stantial flesh and blood. “ Lord Ormington saw the
return ‘KILLED,' with his own eyes, at the Horse Guards !
- This is the third instance I have known of a similar
blunder.- We have been in black ever since the returns.
How glad I shall be to throw it off! The weather is get-
ting very close for bombazine. But, gracious Heaven,
Cis ! how you are altered !-You are so brown, I might
almost say as black as a Spaniard, I hope you mean to
shave off those horrible mustachios !-You will drop the
dragoon-officer now, I trust!-By the way, do the French
women of ton wear the chimney-pot bonnets, imported by
the Duchess of Oldenburg ? I cannot persuade myself
that anything so extravagant is du bon genre ; and, after
all, the Duchess, though the Emperor's sister, can't be
called a criterion of fashion. But you don't ask after poor
Bibiche ? —”
“ I don't ask after her— because I want no news ; her
effigy yonder cries ' circumspice!’ as loud as the monu-
ment of Sir Christopher Wren in St. Paul's. The natu-
ralist has done her justice! Except at Guildhall, I never
saw a finer specimen of stuffing. Only that she looks
rather more animated than when alive."
“ Ah, Cis, you were always shamefully unjust to that
poor dog ! It is only two months since she was taken
from me!-I assure you I feel her loss sensibly.— There
are times when I am obliged to throw a handkerchief over
the glass-case.—When Miss Richardson is out of the way,
and I am sitting here alone, I often fancy I feel her
scratching my gown to be taken up.--Blane attended her

through the winter.—But he said from the first, it was a
lost case !—She was in years, poor little creature! She
would have been thirteen year old, had she survived till
Michaelmas.-In fact, she died of old age.—Blane called
it asthma, but it was old age. — They always talked about
asthma, when Zaime, her mother, grew infirm. But I
knew it was old age.”
It was painful to interrupt these important family com-
munications, with inquiries after Lord Ormington, my
brother, and sister.
“ Danby ? – oh, much as usual, I believe. I rather
think Lady Susan is going to be confined again. I wrote
you word, last year, didn't I, of the birth of his son ?-
They made a wonderful fuss about it, down at Ormington,
- roasted oxen, and made bonfires, and all that sort of
thing, as if it were the first son-and-heir ever heard of in
in the world. Lord Ormington took especial delight in
marking his triumph. Danby has a house in Connaught
Place ; just like him, (isn't it?) to go and settle at the
extremity of the world !-His father, however, does not
seem to think it far off, for he is there every day of his
life. I can tell you, Cis, that if you wish to stand well
with Lord Ormington, you must not be wanting in civility
to Danby and Lady Susan.”
“My dear mother,” said I, gravely, “ before I quitted
England, you were constantly advising deference to Lord
Ormington and my brother as a matter of policy rather
than of affection. I don't pretend that I ever found my
heart overflowing with the family tenderness I have observed
in other men. But whatever may have been exacted of
me as a boy, as a man I will never affect a particle of con-
cession towards either of them, beyond what their conduct
claims at my hands. Lord Ormington used to communi-
cate with me through his lawyers; as to my brother, he
might have conversed with me through a speaking-trumpet,
for any fraternal civilities that garnished his communi-
cation. So let it abide ; what they have made me, they
will find me. Thank Heaven, I have found friends in
my profession, whose regard enables me to dispense with
their niggardly kindness.”

“We will enter into this another time,” said Lady
Ormington, somewhat nervously ; “ but I entreat you, my
dear Cis, don't let me hear you talk about your profes-
sion.' Your profession !—Even if you had gone into the
Guards, as you wanted, I should not have liked to hear
you talk of the army as a profession ;-and—”.
“ Perhaps not,” — said I, ruthlessly interrupting her;
“ but, after fighting my way through three years' hard
· campaigns, and by my own exertions attaining an honour-
able rank in the service, ”
“ The Portuguese service !- which always sounds like
the marines, or something of that sort —”.
- I should recommend no one but your ladyship to dis-
parage it in my hearing,” said I, with becoming indignation.
- There !-exactly the dragoon tone and cut,” cried Lady
Ormington, whimpering. “It couldn't be worse if you had
been spending the last three years in country quarters !”
Luckily for my patience, Lord Ormington at that
moment entered the room ; and I can scarcely do justice
to the warmth and deep feeling of his welcome. I had
not thought “ the old man had so much blood in him ;"
for there were actual tears upon his cheek as he pressed
my hands in his. I suspect the news of my death had
produced considerable self-impeachment in the family.
More than one of them felt they had visited too harshly
upon my head, faults or crimes of which I, at least, was
innocent.
Again and again did he recount to me the particulars
which had reached Government of my having fallen at
Toulouse ; and very readily did I explain in return that,
having been taken prisoner, slightly wounded in the hand,
the exchange by which I was released, was not effected at
the period of despatching the returns.
“ No need to recur to it now, since you are safe and
among us again,” cried Lord Ormington, looking kindly
at my mother, as if sympathizing in the joy she must
experience on the occasion. But Lady Ormington was
absorbed in considering what summer dress would be in
readiness for her to put on, when she threw off her mourn-
ing on the morrow.

I could see that I had gained enormously in Lord Or-
mington's estimation by the good reports of my conduct,
as a man and an officer, which had reached the Horse
Guards, with the announcement of my death. Three
years of active service had redeemed me from the personal
obloquy under which I had previously laboured ; and the
bronzed face and shabby coat which so disgusted her lady-
ship, were in his eyes the honourable badges of a noble
calling. For my own part, I felt that no mortal had ever
undergone in three years such a transformation for the
better as Lord Ormington. I had reason to suppose the
opinion reciprocal.
It was not, however, solely to my accession of merit
that the change in his feelings was due. I had ceased to
be his heir presumptive ! - I had ceased to be an object of
jealous antipathy to him! - The early marriage of Danby
had been of his lordship's devising; and so gratified was
he in the success of his plan, that he seemed almost in-
clined to include even me in his gratitude to Providence
for having blessed my brother with increase, in direct heir-
ship to his honours.
It seemed a relief to him, moreover, when, instead of
exhibiting envy or soreness, I frankly congratulated him
on the birth of the grandson, the fame of whose sponsal
rites had reached me in lands beyond the sea.
" It is a prodigious fine boy !” — cried Lord Orming-
ton, with sparkling eyes. “ Croft assures me he never
saw a finer ! — And Lady Susan expects to be confined
again about Midsummer ! —”.
In this triumphant announcement, I saw only a promise
of the duration of my favour. He proposed to me to ac-
company him to Connaught Place, after dinner ; and was
satisfied with my excuses only when I represented that
danger might arise to Lady Susan Danby from too sudden
a presentation of the brother-in-law, for whom she was
in mourning. Meanwhile, not a word of Hanmer and
Snatch, — not a sarcasm, — not a covert sneer ! - Lord
Ormington was as companionable with me after dinner, as
though we had done nothing but doat upon each other
from the hour I was born ! -

It is true, we soldiers were just then top sawyers in the
world. We had so much to relate which, though now a
hundred and thrice told tale, was then new and startling.
All we had seen and suffered, still wore its gloss of novelty.
There was something in our uncouth raiment, and weather-
worn visages, that attested our vauntings. The self-same
anecdotes related by the soft silken Cis Danby of the F. O.
three years before, would not have assumed half the
authenticity.
Lady Ormington was doubly enchanted when she found
that the sympathy testified towards me by her Lord, was
but a faint foreshowing of the fever of fashion I excited
among the coteries of the season. I was the lion of the
day ;- that is, the lion of private life, as the Emperor and
Kings, of public. After Blucher and Platoff, in fashion-
able favour, came the Cecil Danby who had risen from
the dead. The story of my return, with variations ad
libitum, was related throughout all the coteries royal,
noble, and ignoble of the Metropolis ; how the butler
swooned and my lady shrieked, — how Lord Ormington
was forced to alter his will, and the dam' d'honour' to
change her apartment. —
The dam' d'honour,' the Toady Richardson aforesaid,
was, I believe, the only person who thought I might have
been just as well lying in the sands of Toulouse, as in the
blue convolvulus bed. No longer blue convolvulus, how-
ever. Profaned by the investiture of Toadyism, I repre-
sented to my lady-mother the necessity of complete reno-
vation ; and had now the honour of sleeping in hangings
of sea-green damask, precisely the pattern of those which,
the following year, Bullock sent out to Longwood for the
use of a still greater hero than myself.
“ I must really have you sit to Lawrence, Cis, before
your guerilla look is quite worn off! —” cried Lady Or-
mington; “ or Phillips ! I should like Phillips to paint
you in the style in which he painted Byron, in his Arnaout
dress. You would make a beautiful brigand! Lady Susan
assures me you were more run after at White's ball, the
other night, than any of the Duke of Wellington's aide-
de-camps.'

“ I was not aware of being hunted,” said I, relapsing
into one of my ineffable smiles of former days. “ Cer-
tainly the Pékins have just now a sorry time of it. The
hero fever is raging. We poor soldiers must make hay
while our sun shines.”
I appeal to those readers of my own sex who are able
to call to mind the epoch in question, (for to call upon
readers of the fairer to remember the events of seven-and-
twenty years ago, were to add insult to injury,) whether
the shabbiest and most rusty pair of mustachios might not
have taken the field against ten thousand a-year ? — My
brother had every reason to exclaim as Sir Walter Scott
did to Moore — “Ah! Tam, mon ! — it's lucky for us we
came sae soon !” — The political distinctions which had
made a demigod of him, three years before, would not
have stood their ground against a cornetcy of Cossacks.
It is true, the Emperor and King, or as the mob fa-
miliarly abbreviated them, “ Proushia and Roushia,” had
inquired for him by name, as one of the most distin-
guished speakers of the House. But what was the curiosity
of an emperor, compared with the idolatry of Almack's
lavished upon one whom the lovely creatures protested had
been the first in the breach at St. Sebastian's, and was not
only killed, but buried at Bayonne ! Women seldom trou-
ble themselves to be very accurate in such matters. — But
who would not rather be blundered about by the enthu-
siasm of a hundred handsome women, than figure legiti-
mately in the pages of Napier's History, or Gurwood's
Bulletins ? —
What a moment it was ! — Stars and garters, what a
moment it was ! - What an outbreak of public feeling
celebrated the cessation of the European panic, the great
blessing of peace ; peace that was to re-consolidate broken
fortunes, suppress taxes, and heal the wounds of so many
bleeding families ; peace that was to efface if possible
from the records of God, the damning fact that the pro-
gress of forty centuries of civilization and eighteen of
Christianity, had done no more towards humanizing man-
kind, than comported with murders by thousands and tens
of thousands, sanctioned under the name of WAR! -

I was young then, and under the dominion of the en-
thusiasm of the moment. But on looking back dispas-
sionately to my three years' apprenticeship in the art of
heroism, I shudder at the idea of the ferocious enormities
in which I acted my part. It puzzles me to guess whe-
ther the tears of good angels, or the mirth of bad ones
must exceed, while watching the progress of this whole-
sale butchery, — this crime with a premium, - arising
from disputes whether such and such districts of the earth
shall pay taxes to such or such a sovereign ! — At all
events, from the said sovereigns down to a poor colonel of
auxiliaries, like myself, all the world united to welcome
the piping times of peace; and the coteries of London, so
long given over to the twaddling of Lords and school-boys,
knelt down to kiss the print in the dust of a pair of jack-
boots.

Napoleon, — " la plus grande gloire depuis César !” — He

child blows down a pack of cards. I am not sure that

tive treason, or treason of some shape or colour. — But

Not that the people had reason to complain of their
Lords and Governors. The afflicted King was as though
numbered with the dead; and as to the Regent, who, to
beguile the Times, looked like the time, — of all modern
princes he was the man to play the host to the exotic
royalties to whom we were affording kingdom-room : grace-
ful, -- gracious, — a proficient in foreign languages, and
super-skilled in the superficial arts of life.
It is true the shapely waist of " Roushia,” and the
rough manliness of “ Proushia,” formed a disadvantageous
contrast to the unwieldiness of a prince who had not been

dieting on soup made of his own boots ; nor was the effigy
of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent the one most
calculated to win a lady's eye, of all those limned by Law-
rence for the edification of posterity. As my friend
Byron said one night at Watier's, but no ! - had he
intended the mot for publication, he would have printed it
himself.
For my part, it was neither Roushia nor Proushia, —
Lawrence nor Byron,--the Regent nor Mr. Wilberforce —
who arrested my attention. Reflect, indulgent reader,
that for three years past, my eyes had beheld nothing fairer,
in the shape of the grand-daughters of Eve, than the sut-
tlers of a camp, or the coffee-coloured beauties of the Penin-
sula. I never could abide the complexion of Spaniards or
old point. I like a woman's cheek to be as the rose, be-
fore black roses were invented by modern science. I do
not care to see the idol of my soul blush walnut-colour.
To me the transparent beauty of those English faces was
something angelic! Like the Teutons, I could make no
distinction between Englisch and Engelisch! - I am not
sure, by the way, that English women were ever before
seen to such advantage, and I doubt whether they ever will
again ; for they were themselves. No French modistes or
coëffeurs, no torturer in stays, shoes, or curling irons, were
established in unsophisticated London. Their curls,
shapes, complexions, were their own. They talked Eng-
lish, and they looked English. A French woman is as
sweet as the sweetbrier, and nearly as piquante. But an
English woman who affects the French woman, is like the
donkey in the fable, leaping spanielwise into his master's lap.
Never do our country women blunder more heinously
than in renouncing that nationality which, in 1814, caused
the Allied Sovereigns to assign them the palm over all that
the banks of the Seine had developed for their captivation.
It is true their Majesties regarded, just then, those self-
sufficient divinities with the scorn of captors, — the scorn
which prompted Bonaparte in the rampancy of success, to
deter the painter David from the completion of his picture
of Timoléon, by saying that “après tout, qu'est ce que les
Spartiates ? — Des vaincus!” —

I would give — all that is left me in this world my

BREAKING up for the holidays is a pleasant thing,
whether to soldiers or school-boys. But after sickening
themselves with plum-cake, comes the re-action. Homer
and birch cannot be laid aside for ever.
The first thing Peace had leisure to discover was that
War must be paid for ; and long before the triumphal
arches of laurels had been cleared away, or the stages for
fireworks removed from the Parks, the nation began to cry
aloud that it was about to appear in Basinghall Street;
that it was all up with Great Britain ! -- after pretending
to give the law to the universe, she was all but amenable
to the Poor Law, and strongly advised to take the benefit
of the act. — Tell it not in Gath! -- or, at all events, tell
it not in Gaul: — but so it was! -

mother to defer her departure till September, I was as
glad to go in August as if its grassy uplands had been
scrubby moors, and its partridges grouse. The rookery
disturbed me no longer. I began to feel that the place
was home; that its plantations and turnip-fields were not
as other plantations and turnip-fields. I had not yet for-
gotten how often among the scorching plains and unsightly
maize fields of the Peninsula, I had longed to flee away,
and be at rest under the shade of my ancestral oaks.
Lord Ormington was pleased with the frankness of these
admissions. He was beginning to treat me, if not as a
son, as an agreeable acquaintance. Since my resuscitation
was an inevitable evil, the whole family seemed resolved
to make the best of me. By tacit consent, not one of us
ever adverted to any event antecedent to my precipitate
expedition to Lisbon ; my mother having admitted that it
was in consequence of the remonstrances of Lord Orming-
ton, grounded upon those of Danby and the intelligence of
Lady Harriet, that old Hanmer had thrust out of his hands
the guardianship of his illstarred Portuguese ward. But she
disavowed all knowledge of the harshness of his conduct :
and was indignant when I assured her that the flight of the
d'Acunhas from England originated in the terrors with which
they were beset by the cunning old lawyer. But I was not
fully convinced ! —Experience has proved in many a well-
known instance, that no means are considered unjustifiable
to secure a family highly connected from plebeian alliance.
-Slander becomes meritorious, and falsehood virtue, rather
than that a ball of their coronet should be tarnished.
That the broken heart of Emily was attributable to the
picture of my vices and treachery towards herself, skilfully
touched by the solicitor in Southampton Buildings, proved
Messrs. Hanmer and Snatch to be my bitter enemies.
Lord Ormington, however, made no further allusion to
their name. My allowance was paid through his bankers,
and his pleasure signified by himself.
I fancied – it was probably only fancy, -- that, after
the birth of Lady Susan Danby's second child, --- a girl,
he grew a little less cordial. But I had no reason to
complain.

If reserved with me, he was mysterious with all the
world ; and we got on a wonderful deal better together,
now that I knew a bean from a pea field, and mangel
wurzel from Swedes, and condescended to potter with him
in his rides and walks.
The house was full of company for the shooting season.
Battues were not yet in fashion ; but the Ormington
preserves had lost nothing during my absence. All this
was better fun than among the guerillas. I scarcely
understood the philosophy of Danby, who had declined my
father's proposition to give up the family place to him on
his marriage. But the peculiar distinction of my brother's
character was moderation, — the highest quality, perhaps,
of the philosophy of civilization. Sabine farms are
thoroughly out of fashion. The first incentive to distinc-
tion, in modern times, is prodigality ; and we have seen
not only the richest inheritors gallop through their fortunes
into beggary, but the greatest men, who by high faculties
have achieved riches and honour, condemn themselves to
years of misery, by an attempt to rival the brilliant existence
of people richer and sillier than themselves.
I was not then able to appreciate the profound wisdom
of Danby's modest establishment. It requires a great
mind to enter into the greatness of moderation. All the
mediocrities of public life, for instance, admitted them-
selves disappointed in the honourable member for Rig-
marole. Since his splendid outburst, he had not made a
single speech deserving the honours of the press. He was
little cited for eloquence,—those who had raved about him
as an orator having given him up for showier debutants.
It was only the practical men, like Votefilch, who saw in
him the unboasting Hercules whose shoulder was ever to
the wheel of the party, — whose prognostications had been
oracularly fulfilled, — and whose greatest greatness of all,
was the modest good sense with which he contented him-
self with a subordinate place in the eyes of the public. -
For if the power of acquiring be a great thing, the
power of abstaining from acquirement is greater a thou-
sand fold.

Susan ; domestic, without nauseating others by a display
of their domesticity, and wholly free from that impertinent
egotism à deux coups, which passes for a virtue among the
exceedingly-selfish, rigidly-righteous, of Great Britain.
They neither withdrew from society, to be made more of
by each other than society was likely to make of them;
nor, in society, affected to see and feel for themselves. It
was impossible to bear their faculties more meekly, or
to fulfil their parts more discreetly on the stage of the
world.
Another, and scarcely less sober couple in our family
circle, were Mr. and Mrs. Halbert Herries, or, as the news-
papers would say,—“Halbert and the Hon. Mrs. Herries”
- Julia having been many months the wife of my former
colleague. But my former colleague was now under
secretary of state ; and his bride, in addition to her heredi.
tary ten thousand pounds, had inherited forty from her
maiden aunts. The match was consequently a prudential
one on both sides ; and Herries, originally as grave as a
judge, was now as grave as a lord chancellor.-I am not so
sure, by the way, that the illustration is a happy one ; the
chancellors I have seen on the woolsack, - including
Erskine, Eldon, Lyndhurst, Brougham, — having been
renowned for runaway marriages and convivial propensities,
rather than for the solemnity of their deportment.
My mother could not bear the marriage. She had
written word of it to me in Spain, as a job of Lord Vote-
filch's; and was constantly lamenting that her daughter
had not married Lord Riddlesworth, a Catholic Irish peer;
or Colonel Morley, who, on finding Lady Harriet Vande-
leur's jointure forfeitable by a second marriage, had looked
upon Julia's ready money as a readier payment for his
debts. Even now, though she saw Mrs. Herries perfectly
happy, and occupying a highly honourable position in life,
she was always protesting against the precariousness of
official distinctions, and the odiousness of office-men.
Her taquinerie appeared to fall innocuous on the happy
couple. They were like people living secure in a thunder-
storm, under shelter of a conductor. They were content !
So far as Herries was concerned, the boy had proved so

genuinely father to the man, that is, the clerk to the secre-
tary, that I very much doubt whether he were so much as
cognizant of any event occurring beyond the pale of the
official circle radiating from the centre in Downing Street.
Herries always looked puzzled when accosted by Lord
Ormington with domestic or country news; as if he longed
to say, “I beg your pardon, — that belongs to the Home
Department!"
As for my sister, my red-haired sister, poor contemned
Julia, I scarcely venture to speak of her, lest in making
the amende honorable, I seem to fall into the contrary
extreme of partiality. La Bruyère has said, “ si une laide
se fait aimer, ce ne peut être qu'éperdument,” since it is a
passion that must arise from the weakness of her lover, or
some inherent quality superior to beauty. Mrs. Herries
possessed a plurality of qualities superior to beauty. She
was both aimable and amiable; - both estimable and
excellent, – that is, both loveable and excellent; for there
was something in the charm of her manner and intonation
of her voice, combined with the alabaster-lamp-like trans-
parency of her countenance, which most men found irre-
sistible. Wherever she went, the place by her side was
eagerly appropriated. No one talked more agreeably; no
one possessed such general information, or said her say in
so pleasant and unpretending a manner.
We had not spent a week together at Ormington, before
I began to repent me of my former injustice. Grateful
for the gentle cordiality with which, as Herries's wife, she
accepted as a friend the man who, as Julia Danby, had
rejected her as a sister, I repaid her generosity with the
gift of my whole confidence. Julia was the only member
of my family to whom I ever named the name of Emily;
and never shall I forget my thankfulness when the tears of
my neglected sister flowed in sincere sympathy at the
recital of my troubles.
Of all confidantes, give me a woman ! - For warmth of
sympathy, — for active aid, for good faith, — for trust-
worthiness, -I say again, give me a woman !- Man (who
in the fable painted the subjugation of the lion,) has chosen
to paint, both in fable and history, the inconsistency of

womankind, - its infirmity of purpose, - its incontinence
of tongue. Away with fabulists and historians !— Rather
a thousand times confide a secret to a woman, than to a
gabbler of one's own sex; whose jealousies and envyings
are gaping to devour one; and who, instead of being a
noun substantive, is, after all, only an item of his clubs
and his freemason's lodge. A woman is herself, — that is,
kind, generous, and true. I swear I would as soon run
my head against an iceberg, as entrust my sorrows to one
of my own cold, double-breasted, double-milled sex.
Of my former friends, or associates, some had achieved
greatness, and some had greatness thrust upon them.
Chippenham had achieved it by a natural progress, on the
decease of his father, to the Upper House; and having of
course inherited with his peer's robes the graces and facul-
ties of estate, he was now an ambassador, with her Excel-
lency Lady Theresa for his Countess. The Earl and
Countess of Merepark throned it majestically at - ;
and his lordship was described in leading articles as an
able and conscientious man. How far his union with
Lady Votefilch's niece might conduce to open the eyes of
Government to his very sudden accession of abilities, it
becomes me not to determine.
Among those on whom greatness had been thrust, I con-
clude I may enumerate Sir John Harris, K. all sorts of
things, not omitting the Guelphic, and Honorary all sorts
of things at Carlton House and in the Red Book. It
would be difficult exactly to define his functions. He
was supposed to invent wigs and collect Chinese lanterns,
-give designs for yacht cabins, and cottage chimnies. —
But it was all supposition. His exits and entrances were
noted, but nothing wherefore. He was tabooed, and had
ceased to converse with the public at large; occasionally
letting fall something exceedingly piquant to an Earl or a
cabinet minister, which was picked up and arduously
repeated at the clubs. For every one was overjoyed to
quote Sir John Harris ! Even I should no more have
dared to “ Jack” him, now, than to “ George” His Royal
Highness the Prince Regent !
Many origins were assigned to this mysterious favourit-

ism ; competition for a crack teapot at Baldock's, in which
Sir John had ceded the pas with a grace and solemnity
which made it a pas grave ;-an inedited recipe for curaçoa
punch, à crême de thé;-a pattern for a gored stock, which
was said to impart to the most apoplectic throat the
lengthened stiffness “ long drawn out” of a stork. It was
no manner of consequence. Sir John was born in a cork
jacket, predestined to float, like other weeds, on the surface
of the stream ; or, rather, he was one of those of whom it
has been said, “ Aling him with a stone round his neck into
a horse-pond, and he will rise in ten minutes out of the
water, in a court suit, bag-wig, and sword.”
The first time I paid my respects at Carlton House
after my arrival, I determined to take the initiative in
cutting so great a man. But sweet Sir John knew better
than to afford me a pretext for prating of his early where-
about; and held out his finger with almost as much con-
descension as if he had been Emperor of the Celestial
Empire, and I, a mandarin of the third button. I took
him as I found him. It was not for Cis Danby to quarrel
with the pretensions of a coxcomb; and as I have always
considered success the test of merit, as Napoleon did of his
Spartans, I was bound to consider Sir John Harris, K.A.
K.B. K.C. K.D. K.E. K.F. K.G. and so forth through
the alphabet, the Admirable Crichton of modern chivalry.
There was really some excuse for the beknighting, just
then, of so many very simple citizens. The deluge of
foreign titles which had swept over the surface of society,
had created such a craving appetite for titularity, that (as
Napoleon observed of one of his sisters, who sulked with
him for withholding from her the dignities of queen,
“ Would not any one suppose I had defrauded her of her
share of the realms of the king our father ?”) the Prince
might have observed of certain animalculæ crawling about
the court, who insisted upon the honours of knighthood,-
“ Would not any one suppose that all the doctors and
apothecaries in my dominions were born in spurs !-"
There was even one clerical knight, - a crooked scion of a
noble house — who always reminded me of Sir Hugh in
the “ Merry Wives.”

As to myself, I had to run away almost on my knees,
like the Mayor of Newcastle from George the Third, from
the be-Guelphing sword of the Regent. I gave out in the
coterie of Carlton House, by way of buckler to my un-
offending innocence, that I should be disinherited by Lord
Ormington, were I to assume any other designation than
that conferred by my birthright; and secured under lock
and key the insignia of the order of the Tower and
Sword, as though it had been the badge of a hackney-
coachman.
This scrupulosity may now appear overcharged; but I
appeal to all who visited Pariş or London in the year of
grace, 1814, whether a ribbon in the button-hole were not
then the nearest approach to the letters T. F. (Travaux
Forcés) inscribed on the shoulder of a galérien ? —
What was I to attain by being Guelphed ? —- My here-
ditary distinctions placed me in the category of gentlemen,
and my professional ones had certainly done nothing to
place me in that of heroes. I had fought my way
bravely; so had thousands and thousands of others who
put in no claim to the glories of the spur. Soldiership
had done more for me than fifty knighthoods, by softening
the influence of a profound affliction, and hardening the
effeminacy of inveterate foppery. I had now attained as
much philosophy as was compatible with my four-and-
twenty years and a monstrous good-looking face; and
Byron, with whom at Watier's and elsewhere I had picked
up an acquaintanceship almost amounting to friendship,
often expressed his envy of my unaffected apathy, as the
genuine dolce far niente of the heart.
We heard the chimes at midnight together; and he
saw me stand fire without flinching. That was a strange
epoch in the history of the female society of Great
Britain! The knight who suddenly flings aside his
armour, is more defenceless than the simple clown, habi-
tually in cuerpo ; and the English women, who, during the
visit of the Allied Sovereigns, laid aside their prudery to
make a virtue of hero-hunting, certainly went lengths in
the excitement of the hour, which it would be difficult
to match in the histoire galante of less highly reputed

countries. Had Byron lived to complete Don Juan, he
would have put anecdotes on record, in some of which
I was an actor ; in some, himself, such as might have
made the tales of the Queen of Navarre blush or turn
pale with envy.
This it was that rendered Ormington Hall such a
relief to me! Those frantic three months in London,
with their orgies including all that was ruinous to health
or fortune, had so thoroughly disgusted me, that I was
too happy in sauntering with Lord Ormington over his
farms; still happier when chatting by the fireside of
Danby and Lady Susan, at Forest Lodge, a pretty place
they had hired on the Bracknell side of Windsor Forest.
They saw little or no company; for my brother was
as studious and almost as silent as ever. But when he
did converse, people held their breath to listen. Like
the flowering of the aloe or the gestation of the lion, the
product was proportionate to the delay.
I suppose it was on account of Danby's taciturnity
and Lady Susan's extreme gentleness, that their boy, now
nearly two years old, took so decided a fancy for his
soldier-uncle.
I dissuaded him from crawling on the carpet, by insti-
tuting a school of discipline; and with my cane and
word of command got him through his exercise ; till
Lord Ormington, albeit little addicted to mirth, used to
burst into fits of laughing at his martial airs.
Lady Susan was engrossed by her girl ; - Danby in
compiling an edition of the works of Bolingbroke. Little
Arthur consequently fell to my share as a companion.
While enjoying the last gleams of autumnal sunshine
under the magnificent beech-trees overshading the lawn,
originally a part of the royal forest, Lord Ormington and
I seemed to enjoy ourselves more in that little domestic
snuggery, than at his own princely domain. For him, I
suspect, there were disagreeable reminiscences attached to
the old hall; for myself, I do not scruple to own that the
growing friendship of Danby was the great embellishment
of my existence.
Yes !—I, Cis Danby of the cockade, was actually

proud of him, as a brother and as an Englishman ; -
proud of frightful John ;- proud of the urchin exiled to
the nursery that I might play the peacock unmolested.
Through him, I seemed to feel as if the Danby family
were grappled not only to the passing time but to future
ages; and though celebrity has been defined by a clever
French writer as “ le tout petit avantage d'être connu de
ceux qui ne nous connaissent point," it is an advantage
which greater men than myself are far from despising.
I had commenced life by a false step. At the insti-
gation of a passionate impulse, I had abandoned a pro-
mising vocation; and though the military career thus
wildly embraced had spared me life and limb for new
adventures, I never yet saw an existence prosper, which
commenced by a blunder. Sailors have a superstition
against voyages that begin with putting back. I confess I
share the prejudice.
Lord Ormington probably discerned, after I had been
some six months resident in England, that I was giving
myself up to listlessness; like a man whose destinies are
accomplished, when mine, in fact, could scarcely be con-
sidered begun; for he took occasion one day gravely to
inquire whether it were true that I had declined an
appointment in the household of the Regent.
66 To the letter !---" replied I. “ Sir John Harris was
commissioned to offer it me, a few weeks after my appear-
ance at the levee. But though gratified to find myself
honoured by his Royal Highness's notice, I refused the
favour designed me.'
“ You did very wrong,” replied Lord Ormington drily.
“ You must be aware, Cecil, that the peculiar circumstance
under which you threw up your appointment at Lisbon,
have closed the doors of diplomatic distinction against
you ?"
“ Not more closely than I desire !” was my reply. “I
have no yearning after the petty mysteries of the despatch-
box !”
“May I ask, then,” resumed Lord Ormington, “what
are your projects ? — It is right to apprize you, Cecil, that

command my regard and respect in a degree I had little
anticipated, it will never be in my power to do more for you
than I am now doing. By your mother's marriage settle-
ment, you are entitled to ten thousand pounds. I have no
intention of increasing the provision.”
“ Why should you, when it fulfils my utmost am-
bition ? —” said I, coolly: “ Had I remained an idler
about town (for, after all, my shallow duties as super-
numerary-sub in Downing Street, were a mere pretext for
idling about town,) there is every probability that in
process of time, the increase of my bills at Thevenot's,
and Dyde and Scribe's, would have necessitated an appeal
to parliament for the discharge of my debts. Campaigning
luckily took me out of the hands of the Philistines and the
perfumers; and I have now come to consider four hundred
a-year a fortune for a prince of the blood.”
Lord Ormington looked vexed. Perhaps he descried in
my manifesto, symptoms of a relapse into coxcombry.
“I must still presume to suggest,” said he, “that you
would do well not to trifle with the good-will of the
Regent. You are in a situation to require the support of
your friends.”
“A situation ? — " cried I, somewhat surprised, and
fearing he was about to enter into certain long-dreaded
explanations.
“In a situation as a younger son," calmly resumed
his lordship. “You want occupation, Cecil ; you want a
destination for your young energies. There is good in you,
if you would only turn it to good account !”
This was a great deal for Lord Ormington. I remem-
ber the time, in his days of mystery, when, previous to
uttering so long a sentence to any one, (to me he uttered
only monosyllables,) he would have barred the door, and
placed sentinels outside. I contented myself with inquiring
what “good” he thought would result from my holding a
place about the person of the Regent ? —
“ Are you serious, — or is this a return to your old
habits of irony ? — " demanded Lord Ormington. “Is
it nothing to be reckoned among the friends of the Heir-
apparent to the throne ? —”.

“In my opinion, less than nothing !-" I replied.
• Fortuna vitrea est: tum, quum splendet, frangitur.'
“ Who wishes to be caught up and whirled round by the
sails of a windmill ? When I quitted England, I left the
Prince of Wales surrounded by all that is ultra among the
liberals in politics, ---- his very terrier barking Whiggery.
I find the Prince Regent surrounded by all that is narrowest
in Toryism,-his very cockatoo screaming Huzza for
Castlereagh!' "
“His Royal Highness has wisely conceded to the spirit
of the times," replied Lord Ormington, gravely. “The
fable of Dame Partington and her mop is applicable to both
sides of the question. You could scarcely expect the
sovereign pro tempore of these realms —"
“ I expect nothing, — either of or from him !” was my
somewhat cavalier interruption. But from that day, I
perceived that his lordship lost no opportunity of impressing
upon me the ignominious obscurity of being a cadet de
famille, unless the position were upheld by talents or
industry. I was quite of his opinion. But ignominious
obscurity, id est, inglorious ease, was now my idol. For
the life and soul of me, I could not reunite the shattered
links of the chain of ambition !
It was the era of great achievements. Laurels were as
plentiful as hawthorn hedges; and the trumpet of Fame
was almost as familiar as the horn of a mail coach. As
Byron used to say, the only distinction was to be a little
undistinguished. Napoleon, if he had an antechamber of
kings, had also created a mob of heroes : and under such
circumstances to raise oneself above the crowd was an Her-
culean task. I felt that I had not energy for the enterprize.
I resolved, therefore, to content myself with my modest
peninsular renown, till it should be worn threadbare ; then,
trust to the chapter of accidents for its renovation. I tried
to pass off my indolence under the plausible name of con-
tent ; looked wondrous wise, and talked wondrous prosy ;
and in England, (as regards philosophy or morality,) l'habit
fait le moine.

portion of it which calls itself the fine world — was hurry-

ing to Paris. Among others, my mother took it into her
head to experience an eager longing for a glimpse of the
Louvre. She had not visited Paris since I saw the light
there, shortly after the assembling of the States General, in
the Château de Boulainvilliers at Passy, belonging to her
fair and unfortunate friend the Princesse de Lamballe.
“ They tell me all is as we left it ; – that her cypher
remains unchanged in the medallions, and that our names
are still visible carved on the bark of one of the old trees
in the orangerie,” said Lady Ormington, coaxing herself
into a fit of the sentimentals; though in fact she was only
obeying the impulsion of Toady Richardson, who wanted
to get away from my father's legislation. “I shall never
rest till I have ascertained which of my friends escaped
the guillotine, and whether any of them are still living."
To my great surprise, Lord Ormington opposed no
obstacle to the project. But having no illustrious friends
in the Faubourg St. Germain, to incur or escape the hor-
rors of beheading, he saw no necessity for including
himself in the party. As Sir Lionel Dashwood had been
her ladyship’s cavalier on the former occasion, he seemed
to consider it a matter of course that I should be so on
the present.
He did not even put it to me in a hypothetical form,
whether I should accompany Lady Ormington ; but gave
me succinct instructions concerning the mode in which
I was to draw upon his bankers in her behalf. His
liberality was excessive ; but I suspect he would have
given double the money for the satisfaction of getting rid
of us, to divide his time exclusively between Julia and
John. - As he pleased !- I gave him ample credit for the
two thousand pounds he placed to ours at Drummond's,
and departed.
Let it be taken for granted that we arrived safe at Paris.
My readers have, I trust, done justice to my forbearance
in the daubery or description line. If not, I give them
notice that my palette was got up with an assortment of
the finest oil-colours from Newman's, expressly to inflict
a sketch of the Convention upon them, enlivened with the
proper varieties of national costume and British or foreign
uniforms, and the particoloured brilliancy of the Lisbon

quays, crowned by a sunny sketch of high mass in the
cathedral.
It depended upon myself to develop all this in a couple
of dozen pages of historiography, emblazoned like a missal
with scarlet, cobalt, and gold, fine enough for the gorgeous
pages of the most fashionable annual going. But I for-
bore. I reflected that the florid was going out of fashion.
Scarcely a scribbler who wields a crow-quill but has got up a
bit of fine writing of this description, for the use of boudoirs
and the delight of the tallow-chandlers' wives.
For the same reason, I now refrain from embellishing
my life and times with a lively picture of Paris emerging
from the iron pressure of the tyranny of Napoleon, which
may be found in better English in the pages of Scott's
“ Visit,” or “ Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk,” besides being
married to immortal verse in the inimitable Correspondence
of “ The Fudge Family.”
It matters little that all which these or other English
authorities saw or desired to see of Paris, is comprized
within the Boulevards and the Palais Royal. They and
the public were satisfied, and so am I!-
As to Lady Ormington, whom I escorted to the banks
of the Seine, with the conviction that her elegant vale-
tudinarianism would resign itself as quietly to a bergère in
the Hôtel de Breteuil, as to an easy-chair in Hanover
Square, I was literally awed on detecting the influence of
the genius of the place, the moment she found herself once
more within view of the Tuileries. She seemed to recede
the whole twenty-four years of my existence, and become
one-and-twenty again, and a beauty! —

stop. For though her ladyship had attained her forty-

reign whose brightest reminiscences had of course attained
their majority.
To us, by the way, his rotund Majesty was singularly
gracious, affording us what was in his eyes the highest
mark of distinction,-excellent dinners.-— Worthy soul !-
I beg his Majesty's pardon — worthy body! - a course of
twenty years' roast mutton and batter pudding had de-
veloped his royal sensibilities towards the true enjoyments
of life. – Prolonged divorce from the glorious casseroles
of Paris, had taught him the eminent superiority of the
almanach des gourmands over the Almanack of Saxe Gotha;
and while hundreds of antediluvian princesses and ci-
devant duchesses were quarrelling for tabourets, and trying
to restore at the château the Holy Inquisition of ancient
Bourbon etiquette, his Majesty ate, drank, and said grace
after meat; conceiving that, in a world full of marrow
and fatness, where Providence assigns ortolans and pâtés
de foie gras for the food of man — or kings — there can be
no pretext for fretting after idle distinctions of precedence
and estate. I love a straight-forward epicurean, who makes
no compromise with his pleasant vices ; nor disfigures with
a sneer the unctuous lips, imbibing to satiety the good
things of this world !
I was surprised by the way, considering the enormous
ravages of the guillotine, and the number of unfortunate
nobles of the ancien régime said to have died in emigra-
tion in England, not of starvation, but of bad cookery, to
find the Faubourg St. Germain flourishing in all its pristine
stiffneckedness. It did not appear to me that its hotels
could have contained more dowagers or bishops, had
Robespierre never encumbered or disencumbered the earth;
and though we heard of the extinction of ancient families
effected during the Reign of Terror, I did not seem to
miss a single title “ damned to everlasting fame” by the
records of the gallant reign of Louis XV.
Among these, Lady Ormington was an idol. They had
worn her all those twenty years in their heart of hearts ;
and the old Cosway print, deepened in its tints by a quarter
of a century's smoke and dust, was still extant in more
than one hotel of the Rue de Grenelle. On visiting those

old hotels par parenthèse, I could well understand how the
tale of the Belle au bois dormant had found its origin in
the noble Faubourg; for certain of the two-and-thirty
quarterings generations seemed to rise at the restoration of
the Bourbons, from a sleep of a century's duration, cob-
webbed like a bottle of old hock out of the cellar of an
abbot. I am by no means sure that, in the attics of some
of these antiquated mansions, an old woman might not have
been found twirling her antediluvian spindle. The Fau-
bourg was a museum of fossils.
It was a great delight to these classical authorities to
turn the tables upon the parvenu duchesses and countesses
hatched under the wing of the Empire, in Madame Cam-
pan's colombier at Ecouen. The bitterness of contempt
engendered by the honours they had been forced to concede
to these pretty creatures of yesterday, is scarcely to be
imagined; more especially when engrafted upon houses de
pur sang, by a peremptory marriage. Hundreds of
romances, besides that of Madame Gay, might be concocted
out of the Mariages sous l’Empire, which I found bearing
fruit about as palatable as “the apples on the Dead Sea
shore — all ashes to the taste.”—
By such as these, the Allies were welcomed as friends,
and the English as Allies. The moral of the case was
nothing to me. I was content to be choyé and caliné in
those charming boudoirs ; to be told twenty times a day,
that any one might have guessed from my appearance the
secret of my birth; that I deserved to be né Parisien. I
made the most of that happy accident. Like the bat, I
was a bird with the bipeds, and a mouse with the quad-
rupeds ; and, after being adored as a John Bull all the
spring in London, was l'enfant chéri des dames in Paris,
whenever les dames chose me to be chéri.
My former affectations were budding anew. Like a tree
that has been cut down instead of grubbed up, the old
root sent forth a plenteous growth of underwood. The
coterie at the Tuileries was maudlin with enervation.
Everything vigorous or manly seemed to have retreated
from public life ; and the recent vicissitudes of royalty
inspired such a dread of the instability of human enjoy-

ments, that “dum vivimus, vivamus” was the motto of
many wise men besides the pious Dr. Doddridge.
I will not pretend to exculpate myself from the epicu-
reanism of the hour. No one enjoyed more exquisitely the
dinners of Bouvilliers,the gleanings of Corcellet's stores,
the Feen Welt of the ballet, — the pleasantries of the Opera
Comique, — and so on to the end of the catalogue of
Parisian enjoyments. Above all, I was enchanted with
the French women! --I do not blush for my taste. It
is well known that when John Clare, the Northamptonshire
poet, was transplanted for a month into the midst of the
sorceries of London, the thing that charmed him most was
the bewitchment of the French actresses at the Tottenham
Street Theatre.
As to me, I had never before seen a Frenchwoman.
The peevish emigrées, who used to waste their time fretting
over their fall, at Ormington Hall or in Hanover Square,
scarcely deserved the name. As well call an oyster-shell
an oyster, – as well consider the wooden puppet in a
showman's box, the Punchinello, whose squeaking witticisms
convulse the mob with merriment ! - A Frenchwoman,
properly so called, means not only a Parisian, but a
Parisian in Paris. A Parisian must have her appropriate
atmosphere, like the tender tropical plants, to refresh whose
roots the watering-pot is warmed over a slow fire. Her
leaves do not expand, or her flower-buds effloresce, unless sure
of a quantum suff. of sunshine. Il lui faut son Paris ! -
But in her Paris, what a bewitching creature, — what a
brilliant butterfly, — what a richly-scented blossom ! —
Nothing real about her, it is true — but the pretence, how
delightful ! -- One would put up with deception for ever,
when so charmingly bamboozled ! —
A Parisienne, properly so called, is a creature full of
intelligence and grace ; – for her own enjoyment-sake,
incapable of the yea-nay, dawdling, unmeaning nonentityism
of London fashion.--Her countenance is bright with pur-
pose. She wills resolutely, and, lo ! her will is accom-
plished ; - her rapid and strongly accented utterance
imparting irresistible energy to her decrees.
Perhaps I was the more sensible to the agrément of this

vivacity, because recent experience had put me somewhat
out of conceit with my countrywomen. The very good
ones, I had begun to consider fine, — and the very bad
ones, coarse. The society of Byron had not improved my
morality on such points. Lady Harriet Vandeleur (whom
I found established in Paris, not exactly la veuve de la
grande armée, but the idol of the new court,) used to revile
me with sacrilege against the sacred claims of my exceed-
ingly loving countrywomen. No need to inform her
ladyship that she was precisely one of those who had
rendered me so hypercritical ! -
Had I followed the bent of my inclinations, which
nobody does in this world, least of all in the matter of
falling in love, I verily believe I should have dedicated my
affections to some choice specimen of the antique ;-one of
those charming little bits of the Régence still extant au
fond du Faubourg. My early education seemed to have
created me for a passion à talons rouges. I adored the
high polish of those Sèvres-like marquises, transfixed in
their fauteuils, and scarcely more alive than the effigies of
their grandmothers from the pencils of Mignard or Rigaud.
Yet though thus anti-locomotive, what inimitable talkers !
- A new chapter of Grammont's Memoirs seemed un-
folded, when they narrated their incomparable little anec-
dotes of the incongruities of the court of Joséphine, —
that make-believe Versailles, where, like children on a
holiday, l'on jouait à la Madame!
Of one or two of these classics, I was the pet and
favourite; better pleased to share their regard with their
griffon and their abbé, and be called “mon enfant” by
their colourless lips, than “mon cæur” by the unrefined
and vociferous fashionables of the Chaussée d'Antin.
But homme propose, femme dispose. ~I was not to be
my own master, that is, master of who should be my

de Trémont, of whom Boufflers had been the lover, fifteen
years before I was born ! — What causeries we should

obtained into the philosophy of life. — Instead of this,
(dare I confess it? — but I vow I had no more to do with
the matter than one of the Chinese bonzes on her chimney-
piece,) instead of this, I was doomed to be excruciated out
of all patience by the caprices and exactions of the young
and fashionable Comtesse Anacharsis de la Vrillière ! -
Thérèse-(I thought myself a wonderfully happy man
the first day I was permitted to call her Thérèse !) – was
the daughter of one of my mother's most favourite friends.
One of Lady Ormington's first cares on arriving in Paris,
was to inquire for the progeny of her darling Duchesse de
St. Barthélemy, who had fallen a victim to the revolution ;
and great was her indignation on hearing that the young
Duke was wearing away his unpopularity in foreign travel,
having actually figured at the court of Joséphine as
equerry, or grand échanson, or grand something or other in
the way of courtiership. Had it been even Marie Louise,
Lady Ormington and the Bourbons would have borne it.
But it was that one of the Emperor's wives, who had not
been an Emperor's daughter, — la veuve Beauharnais, -
the woman my mother had refused to visit, as mauvaise
compagnie, on her former visit to Paris ! -
But in addition to the said degenerate Duke, the lovely
Duchess had left a little girl, born about the same period
as myself, – at least there was some sort of romance about
a Paul and Virginia interchange of nursing. Little Thé-
rèse, my contemporary, was now of course, according to
the Parisian kalendar, an old woman, — that is, four-and-
twenty ; and pleasantry apart, a marriage at sixteen is apt
to reduce four-and-twenty to decrepitude.
But then Thérèse, if an old woman, was a woman of
transcendant fashion ; - one of those angels without wings
to whose delicate features the equally delicate pencil of
Isabey has assigned immortality.
Go to Versailles, gentle reader. - Go to the museum
dedicated to toutes les gloires de la France; and in the
great picture of the baptism of the King of Rome, you
will discover seated in the tribune, surmounted by a coronet
of diamonds, a face scarcely equalled in sweetness not only
from those days to these, but from the days when Rome

had Emperors, till those when the Eternal City was
required to acknowledge that very transitory little king.
If it do not give you the idea of Miranda, “admired
Miranda,” sunning herself in the smiles of Prospero in her
tranquil island, may you never turn a page of Shakspeare
again !-
Thérèse was not quite so pretty as that picture when I
had first the honour of making her acquaintance; but she
was a lovely creature still. To me, there was something
peculiarly interesting in her faded languor. I saw she
was what is called passée ; and not possessing a French-
man's intuitive knowledge of such matters, instead of
attributing her loss of bloom to the natural progress of
events, chose to surmise a secret sorrow, “ a worm i' the
bud."
I fancied, according to my English creed, that in
woman, four-and-twenty is the meridian of beauty; that,
should these clouds of sorrow ever pass away, the obscured
luminary would shine forth again, more effulgent and soul-
subduing than ever.
I could not have flattered the pretty Comtesse more
than by the construction with which I chose to dignify
her defects. Thérèse would rather have been thought
“ interesting," than fair as Hebe. Thérèse had carved
out her role in the world in sable drapery, or at least in
French grey. Thérèse was la femme incomprise! — The
phrase is banal now, exhausted, — effete. — Everybody
understands the femme incomprise, and a woman might as
well pretend to be an Egyptian mummy for any interest
likely to be excited among the cunning fellows of la jeune
France, by so exploded a pretension. But it was specious
enough then. Universal sympathy was enlisted in the
sorrows of a femme incomprise.
Monsieur le Comte de la Vrillière, the lord if not the
master of the unappreciated lady, was a very great man in
his way, and a very large man, and in everybody's way;
the very prototype that Bernard Léon depicts when, in
the part of an employé, he distends his capacious chest like
an air-cushion, exclaiming, “ Prenons le maintien d'un
homme en place !”

The Count's maintien, instead of being heavy and
clumsy, like most unwieldy persons of my own country,
was sinuous and graceful as one may conceive the Apollo
Belvidere fed upon oilcake, and weighing sixteen stone.
He was rotund, without being shapeless, - rubicund, with-
out being couperosé;-a rosa grandiflora,—two handsome
men rolled into one!
Impossible to be more soigné in his person. His grey
hair and whiskers were arranged with as much care as if
ambrosial curls. His coat was as scrupulously symme-
trified by Staub as though his waist were as slender as his
means were great ; his boots were as well varnished as if
the members they encased were not capable of playing
the part of the Oriental ox and treading out the corn.
Monsieur le Comte Anacharsis de la Vrillière was spruce,
lustrous, black, white, red, vivid, and got up to admiration.
But in spite of all this, (the truth must out!) he was not
the man to win a lady's eye or ear. His appetite was
“ more to bread than stone,” and more to a succulent
dish of cutlets, with an excellent sauce à la Soubise, than
bread. The consequence was, qu'il avait pris du ventre;
and a protuberance below the region of the heart is more
unsightly to the eye of woman, than the hunch of Æsop
or hump of a buffalo.— Nothing in nature so antipathetic
to an exalted imagination !-
There was nothing else that I remember particularly
odious in La Vrillière, except that he had robust health,
breathed hard after dinner, and possessed at all hours of
the day a sort of insolently prosperous air, that must cer-
tainly have exposed him more than once in his life to peril
of assassination from the brooms of street sweepers. It is
an act of great self-denial in beggars, to put up with a man
so self-assertingly well to do in the world.
But if an object of hatred to the kennel, he was one of
surpassing affection to the court — the court, tale quale. —
He was just one of the men of whose moral and physical
preponderance Napoleon knew so well to dispose ! He pos-
sessed the very length, breadth, and thickness for a Préfet.
His respectability of person and purse was the one thing
needful to fill an Hôtel de la Préfecture, in a southern de-

partment; and during the last five years of the Empire,
accordingly, Monsieur le Comte Anacharsis de la Vrillière
had eaten his truffles fresh from the sod, with a stipend
from government of eighty thousand francs a-year, and the
opportunity of dedicating his income matrimonial of cent
mille francs de rentes, towards upholding, on behalf of the
Emperor, the dignities of the state.
The match was of Napoleon's making. Anacharsis de
la Vrillière was a man of high descent, who, beggared by
the revolution, (which found him with a very good head
on his shoulders, and, strange to tell, left it there un-
molested,) had managed by dexterous appropriation of his
talents to the shifting exigencies of public life, to win back
all he had lost, like a cunning gamester, taking his revenge
on fortune. Directory, Consulate, Empire had successively
found his Ko-too at their disposal. POWER was with him
the right divine ; and like most of those,
Who, as the veering wind shifts, shift their sails,
a trade wind blew him into port. He was, in short, one
of the thousand Tartuffes of political life engendered by
the schisms and vacillations of la chose publique.
Among the numerous rewards lavished upon him by
a sovereign in no position to deal hypercritically with
the moral qualities of his partizans, was the hand of
Mademoiselle de St. Barthélemy. As a rich orphan, she
had been of course Campanized ; for as Frederick of
Prussia chose to institute a Newmarket for the improve-
ment of his race of grenadiers, by alliances between six-
feet-two of hero with six-feet nothing of heroine, Napoleon
of France, aware that the era of brute force was at an end,
chose to giganticize his adherents by uniting men of ten
thousand-a year in ambition with women of ten thousand
a-year in possession.
Hence the discrepant union between the soft, sentimental
Thérèse de St. Barthélemy, and the prize animal, Monsieur
le Comte Anacharsis de la Vrillière, - conseiller d'état -
chevalier de la légion d'honneur, &c. &c. &c. Hence, la
femme incomprise! —
For how was it possible for an individual of such

dimensions, an individual who, if fossilized, would have
afforded grounds to Cuvier for a new theory upon the
degeneration of mankind, to enter into the crises de nerfs
and migraines, hysterical affections and catalepses, of a
diaphanous creature like Thérèse, -- a sylph, an aërial
being, — liable to evaporate on the too rude touch of a
mortal so materially material as Monsieur le Préfet ?--
La Vrillière perfectly understood, on the first proposition
of the match by his friend Cambacères, the substantial ad-
vantages attached to the possession of this unsubstantial
bride ; and, to do him justice, had never ceased to de-
monstrate his consciousness d'avoir fait une excellente
affaire. In France, holy matrimony is always an affaire,–
that is, an affaire of everything but the heart. He was a
model husband. The pin money of Madame la Comtesse
was as punctual as the coupons of the Bank of France. A
new equipage every second year — diamonds reset every
third -- and annual étrennes from the glittering magazine
of Janisset, which made many an envious eye of the
Faubourg “pale its ineffectual fires," attested the ardour
of his conjugal devotion.
No one could say that the salons of Madame la
Comtesse de la Vrillière lacked a single object of fashion-
able adornment which Lesage or Ravrio stated to be
indispensable to a woman of fashion. When installed at
her Préfecture, her fêtes, her toilet, her household estab-
lishment, created all the precedents of the province. She
enjoyed, as the phrase runs, everything that money can
give. But, alas ! it too often happens that people who
enjoy everything in the power of money to give, enjoy also
a redundance of leisure, which begets an appetite for
things that money will not give.
Madame la Comtesse de la Vrillière sighed for a senti.
ment! Madame la Comtesse wanted to be “ Thérèse.”
Her indulgent husband, huge as he was, did not fill up the
vacuum in her soul. He did not love her ;- and who
would waste their affections on the unloving? - She pre-
ferred being a victim. She chose to be la femme incom-
prise !-

and Madame Cottin, its eldest daughter, had usurped pos-
session of her brain. She had never recovered “ Atala”
and “ Réné,” and had wept a Hellespont over “ Claire
d'Albe” and “ Malvine." She would rather have been
the impassioned Matilde, blistering her feet with Malek
Adhel, in the Syrian sands, than Madame la Préfette at
- , or Madame la Comtesse, in the Rue du Montblanc.
Néobstand, as her favourite writer would have said, I sus-
pect she was almost in hopes of a reverse of fortune, when
Napoleon took refuge on board the Bellerophon.
It suggested itself to her sanguine imagination that the
fat Préfet might possibly be incarcerated for life at Ham,
or Mont St. Michel, or Blaye, or la Force, or, perhaps,
driven into exile or emigration, the idea of poor Ana-
charsis being driven anywhere !) to die at Cayenne or
some other peppery colony. In that case, she determined
to become a Sæur de Charité, one of the interesting vic-
tims of romantic life whose costume is least unbecoming.
But to her surprise, almost to her indignation, the first
person to whom the thanks of His Majesty Louis XVIII.
were tendered for the promptitude of his oath of allegiance,
was M. le Comte Anacharsis de la Vrillière, now Che-
valier de St. Louis ; and, lo! the daughter of the ancient
and loyal house of St. Barthélemy was folded to the
bosom of the Duchess d’Angoulême, till she was ready to
cry for vexation and mercy.
Not the smallest opening for heroism in that direction !
- No hope of persecution — no chance of a reverse. —
On the contrary, the family diamonds were reset a year
sooner than usual ; and on establishing herself anew in the
Rue du Montblanc, a completely fresh ameublement
saluted the repining eyes, whose only quarrel with the
rumpling of the rose-leaf in her destinies was that it did
not turn out a thistle or prickly pear.
Such was the position of the Countess, when I arrived
at Paris. On the entrance of the allies into Paris, the
Count still occupied his prefectorial functions in the south;
or the femme incomprise would most likely have been appre,
ciated by some General of Cossacks, or Hessian Field-
marshal, -- Mohicanly starred and feathered. But it was

precisely at the moment my mother was beating the bushes
of Boulainvilliers and the Luxembourg gardens, in search
of such scatterlings of the covey of the ancienne noblesse
as were still extant, that Monsieur le Comte et Madame la
Comtesse Anacharsis de la Vrillière were welcomed to the
exceedingly soft bosom of the new Court.
Lady Ormington was overjoyed at the meeting. There
had always been intense sympathy between her and the
Duchesse de St. Barthélemy. They had drunk of the
same ether, and wept over the same page of the Nouvelle
Héloïse ; and on discovering that the daughter who in-
herited the Duchess's name of Thérèse, inherited also her
nature as a swooner of swoons, and sympathizer of sym-
pathies, Lady Ormington began to feel that she had
recovered a congenial soul, in this younger and fairer
moiety or rather quarter of herself.
Lady Ormington made a bad throw off, however, with
her new idol. On her first introduction to the princely
hotel in the Rue du Montblanc, with its damask hangings,
gilt-bronze arabesques, carpets of Sallandrouze, and tables
of malachite and lapis lazuli, she was naïve enough to con-
gratulate its lovely owner on being thus profusely sur-
rounded with the prosperities of life. Aware that Thérèse I.
had lost her head, she seemed to think that Thérèse II.
must be minus a heart ; actually presuming that the wife
of a man weighing eighteen stone, with an abdominal pro-
minence, a great white forehead, and a great red face,
could possibly be reconciled to her unpicturesque matri-
monial destinies by the possession of varnished rosewood
or damask of Lyons. Never was the femme incomprise
more thoroughly misapprehended than at that moment.
But Lady Ormington was open to conviction. It did
not take long to satisfy her that she looked upon one of
the most unfortunate of her sex; — that the expressive
countenance of the young Countess was indebted for its
pensive paleness to wounded sensibility ; — that her
widowed soul was pining away in all the isolation of con-
jugal mismatchment! - Her ladyship was peculiarly
qualified to enter into these delicate distinctions. She had
been enacting the same tragedy,- comedy, — farce, (what

shall I call it?) for the last quarter of a century ; only
that, not having been educated by Madame Campan, her
phraseology was by no means so Lamartinian, or her tones
so plaintive.
In point of fact, she could not make out so good a case.
Instead of being driven by a despotic Emperor, at the
point of the bayonet, into the arms of Lord Ormington,
she had very thankfully accepted him for better for worse,
three days after his presentation to her, at a country race-
ball; and was consequently sadly to seek in the epithets
and superlatives with which the Comtesse Ånacharsis de la
Vrillière was entitled to qualify her barbarous sacrifice.
In an incredibly short time my poor mother became as
convinced as her new friend could desire, that la veuve du
Malabar, on the point of ascending the funeral pyre, was
not more lonely in the world than her isolated self. If I
wanted to fill a volume, instead of merely desiring to im-
prove the minds of man and womankind by the promul-
gation of this my autobiography, I would favour the world,
in detail, with a few of the pet phrases of poor Thérèse.
But as they are precisely such as all French novelists, from
Louvet and Crébillon down to the chaste pages of George
Sand and Eugène Sue have assigned to la femme incom-
prise, whining her monotonous quail-call after the missing
moiety of her soul, I respect the common sense and un-
common decorum of Great Britain.
When Lady Ormington first acquainted me with her
treasure-trove in the Chaussée d'Antin, I turned an un-
willing ear. There was about as much sentiment in my
soul as in a jar of Jamaica pickles. “ Campaigning at the
King of Bohemy” had alloyed my double-refinement.
At Paris, I had fallen in with a knot of Peninsular
friends, excellent fellows, bon vivants, with whom it was
much more agreeable to explore the carte of Véry and the
foyer of the opera, than to sigh the perfumed sighs of a
lady's boudoir. The only parfait amour which I was
disposed to pronounce nectar, came out of the cellars of
Chevet.

tion for these Platonic heroines ; who seem to consider

the purity of their minds so much less sacred than that of
their bodies, and admit no bond of conjugal fidelity upon
the honest affections of the heart. Whenever Lady Or-
mington used to talk to me of the femme incomprise,
the chaste and lovely wife of the corpulent ex-Préfet, -I
made it a point to answer her with raphsodies about a
matelotte Normande at the Rocher, or a dish of tournedos
at the Frères Provençaux.
I was fated, however, to make acquaintance with the
Countess in a manner pretty certain to convert acquaint-
anceship into something of a tender nature.
It happened, that one day (maledetto sia 'l giorno,
e'l mese, e l'anno !) as I was trying, in the Bois de Bou-
logne, a horrible brute, such as the French horse-dealers
of those anti-jockeyan days used to call a horse, the beast
turned restive; and after seeing the leafless trees of the
Bois run away from me for five minutes or so, a despe-
rate crash seemed to bring heaven and earth together ;
and after the crash, as might be anticipated, — chaos !
I was lying insensible on a heap of flints in the road
leading to the Pavillon de Madrid.
The next sensation of which I was conscious, was that
of awaking in heaven; that is, awaking in a sort of dreamy
Elysium, surrounded by fleecy eider-down, - muslin cur-
tains, - the fragrance of frangipane, — the sobs of waiting
maids, - and by way of antidote to all this delicious
poison, the overhanging face of a doctor by whom I had
been dephlogisticated in unknown quantities, looking ex-
ceedingly like a horned owl in a Vitchoura and a pair of
spectacles. I had never heard of such bipeds in the Elysian
fields; and consequently took it for granted that I was
still in the arrondissement of the Champs Elysées.
I was not fractured ;-only miserably contused ; -
only destined to rise from my couch,—piebald as the brute
which had laid me there. To rise, however, was for the
present out of the question. I was assured so by the
gentle accents of an exceedingly plaintive voice; and to
judge from the predictions of the spectacled owl who
hooted affirmation of her intelligence, no chance of dindes
truffées, or St. Péray frappé, for full six weeks to come!

This was very agreeable intelligence for a man who had
daily dinner-engagements to the end of the Carnival.
There was however no help for it; for when I raised
myself from my pillow to remonstrate, I fell back and
fainted.
On my second recovery, the withered face of the chat-
huant à bésicles was replaced by one whose soft oval
seemed thrown into more beautiful relief by the glossy
bands of raven hair, in which it was enframed. But even
the oval face had been nothing, without the foreign aid
of two pearly tears that stood upon those pure and placid
cheeks. -- Tears! — tears of sensibility, — and shed for
me ! — From that moment, the soft touch of the slender
and feeble fingers attempting to minister to my aid, com-
municated a gentle thrill to my bosom. — I was obliged
to make haste and recover, in order to thank such a nurse
as she deserved. —
In return for my thanks, she “ gave me for my pains a
world of sighs ;" acquainting me, that as she was returning
through the Bois from her villa at Suresne, she had met a
horse without a rider, and found a rider without a horse ;
and that, howbeit her coachman addressed the former beast
in the factionnaire phrase of “ passez au large,” her good
Samaritanism had determined her to pause by the way-
side, and pick up the desolate stranger ; who being too
fine a gentleman to wear anything in his pocket save a few
loose Napoleons and small change, was still Non Nomi-
natus in the mansion where, being a stranger, they had
taken him in.
Never shall I forget the effect of the announcement by
which I thought fit to reply to this delicate note of inter-
rogation. No sooner had I declared myself to be an Eng-
lishman, (a declaration which my accent must have
rendered superfluous,) by name Cecil Danby, and by
domicile resident at the Hôtel de Breteuil in the Rue de
Rivoli, than my charming preserver uttered a sound which
I conclude was what the novelists call “ a faint scream,”
a thing I had always been particularly curious to hear,
from the moment of my acquaintance with the pages of
Monk Lewis and Mrs. Radcliffe. I have a great mind to

be poetical about it myself. Nothing would be easier
than to liken it to the subdued cry of a bird during an
eclipse of the sun ; with which, if my readers be unac-
quainted, I am sorry for them, for there is nothing so
plaintive in or out of nature. Suffice it, however (for I
have an abhorrence of stage trick) that the eider-down bed
was that of Madame la Comtesse Anacharsis de la Vril-
lière, — the soft twining fingers, those of the femme
incomprise !
Lady Ormington was instantly sent for; and said, did,
and cried all that it was necessary to say, do, and cry on
such an occasion. It was a clear case that I could not be
removed. Madame la Comtesse had not been so near the
brink of a sensation for the last five years. Even the ex-
Préfet was enchanted to render service to the offspring of
one whom he remembered a reigning belle at the Trianon,
when he was himself aide-de-camp in '89, to Monseigneur
the Comte d'Artois. In short, I seemed to have been
thrown from my horse expressly to oblige them.
What a convalescence it was ! — How different from
that struggling back to life, at Belem, when conscious –
no, not conscious — anticipative of a great joy awaiting
me, which I wanted only strength to clasp within my
arms ! — Now, I soon perceived that it was my business,
for my own sake and the sake of others, to prolong my
indisposition to the utmost verge of convalescence. « Le
mieux est l'ennemi du bien,” says the proverb. I did
not want to be better, or better off. I was as content
to be returned “ killed ” on this occasion, as on that
which had recommended me to the good-will of Lord
Ormington.
Monsieur le Comte was just then most opportunely pre-
occupied with important business at the Conseil d'état. It
was all he could do to pant into my room once in the
twenty-four hours, with inquiries after my health ; en-
treaties, very needless ones, that I would consider his
house and all that it contained my own; and assurances
that the royal family had made the most minute inquiries
of him into the condition of one in whom they were so
deeply interested as the son of their good Lady Ormington,

the brother of the great champion of European indepen-
dence.
In reply, I looked as pénétré, as grateful, and as feeble,
as I could contrive ; and would have allowed the horned
owl to exhaust the last drop in my veins, rather than
abridge my sojourn in that charming abode. It is all
nonsense when northern imaginations pretend to luxuriate
in descriptions of the gardens of Alcina, — or gardens of
Armida, —or gardens of the Hesperides, or any other gar-
dens,— poetical or prosaic. The very word “garden” has
a damp, aguish sound to an English ear,— a sound as of
water-engines and gravel rollers. If anybody wished to
paint the bower of Circe in a way to make its perils really
alluring to a son of the mist or a son of the fog, he will
make it a snug boudoir, having a patent fire-place-pon-
derous curtains — three-piled carpets - a luxurious divan;
and, by way of garde-malade,- a femme incomprise. —
I wrote word so to Byron. He and I were always
squabbling, upon paper, about the poetry of nature and
the poetry of civilization. It was a hollow pretension on
his part, (he, who could not abide Wordsworth,) to declare
in favour of
The silence that is in the starry sky,
The sleep that is between the lonely hills.
The sleep in which he really delighted, was anything but
lonely; and, as to the starry sky, like myself, he was
much fonder of the fluted damask of a luxurious tester.
Coucher à la belle etoile might be very charming for those
who, like Poussin's bergère, “ lived in Arcadia ;” but,
between ourselves, dear reader, for people who live in the
nineteenth century and pay parish rates, it makes one's
teeth chatter to think of.
I am pretty nearly sure, nay, I have a strong inclination
to prove in black and white, in Childe Harold's hand-

wrecked his hero, as a set-off to my spill, - imagined the
cave, as a contrast to my boudoir, — and devised the fried
eggs as an antithesis to my violettes pralinées. He even
sketched the skittish Zoe as an impertinent set-off to my
charming, little Manette. St. Spiridion be praised, there
was no Lambro in the case ! — for Monsieur le Comte
Anacharsis de la Vrillière, conseiller d'état, ex-Préfet in
esse, and pair de France in posse, was as little akin to the
old pirate-patriot, as I to Hercules.
Champfort has told us, and people have learned to give
some credit to his sayings, that, “ to oblige, is to attach
ourselves ; that by a noble provision of nature, a benefit
conferred rewards itself by the bliss of love :” and if it
be true that l'on s'attache par ses bienfaits, Madame de la
Vrillière had every excuse for predilection in my favour.
Her kindness and charity far exceeded that of the Sama-
ritan, whose bald-headed effigy, pouring a bottle of patent
balsam into the wounds of the distressed man by the way-
side, used aforetime to figure as a sign to the apothecary's
shops.
Youth and beauty apart, Thérèse was a kind creature;
and if incomprise, really deserved to be understood. But
it was herself to whom she was most an enigma ; for she
tried to coax herself into all sorts of absurdities and affec-
tations, when nature had designed her for the same honest
calling as the great majority of her sex.
I dare say I did my part towards confirming her error ;
for it was difficult not to wish that she might continue to
undervalue her happiness as the wife of a man with so
good an account at his banker's, and at the Château, and
a disposition to gratify the inordinate whimsies of a
Parisian wife ; for the influence of her morbid discontents
was manifested in sitting beside my sick couch, — reading
to me — talking to me “ far above singing," — yet singing,
too, whenever I expressed a wish to hear the gentle
cadences of Romagnesi, breathed by the mellifluous notes
of the favourite pupil of Garat. It was from her lips
I learned those charming stanzas addressed by Madame
de Walewska to Napoleon, - a model for all tender
reproaches ; and I could not help flattering myself that

there was what the French call intention, in the countess's
energetic manner of enunciating the concluding verse :
6 Viens, donc, essayer les douceurs
D'une passion sans orage.
Que tu sois fidèle ou volage,
Rien ne désunira nos cours !
Pour te plaire, inon âme ardente
Découvre un nouveau sentiment.
Oui ! sans t'aimer moins vivement,
Je t'aimerai mieux qu'une amante."
I, too, had discovered a new sentiment, as regarded
the beautiful creature who thus generously devoted herself
to my consolation. For, though aware of the utter
groundlessness of her repinings, though convinced of the
grievous wrong she did herself and those belonging to
her, by lavishing on a chimera the affections due to her
larger and legitimate moiety, I fell as much in love as
as if her woes were as real as those of Andromache, and I
King Pyrrhus of execrated memory.
There may be some among my readers who take the
thing au sérieux, and see nothing in all this to laugh at ;
who consider, with Lady Ormington, that it is a cruel
torture for a woman of “exquisite sensibilities," a woman
organized to “die of a rose in aromatic pain,”- a woman
for whom the moon has influences that “ cause every
nerve to vibrate to an unseen centre in the soul,"— a
woman for whom “music hath a language mystic as the
lyre of Apollo,”— a woman worthy to have been chosen
as the partner of the “ Mari Sylphe," united for better
for worse with a soulless, sordid being, whose sensibilities
were invested in the 5 per cents. and whose tenderest point
was his digestion !
Had I been ever blessed or cursed with wife or daughter,
or possessed a right to exercise the tyrannies of legitimate
proprietorship over any fraction of the gentle sex, how
careful would I have been to inspire her with enthusiasm for
some definite pursuit ! - rational, if possible ; at all events,
a pursuit. Men are to apt to sneer at the frivolities of
women's accomplishments; to find fault with daubings
of water-colours, embroiderings of tiffany, collections of
autographs, emblazonings of missals. - My brethren !

mysteries. Failing the maximum, accept the minimum,
and be thankful. Till your better or worse halves acquire,
by force of education, a taste for higher occupation,
discourage nothing that yields harmless employment to
their leisure. In a class of life where neither household
nor nursery exercise peremptory demands, beware of the
lapse of listless hours !- Beware of the peevish retrospec-
tions of reverie !— Beware of the want of excitement
arising from want of occupation !- It is in the unenclosed
waste that the thistle wings its seeds of mischief; it is in
the neglected hedgerow, the night-shade twines its deadly
fruit.
Had Thérèse been only able to conjure up an innocent
enthusiasm for any one of the busy idlenesses of life, she
would have seen in the rotund Anacharsis the indulgent
friend who cheered her occupation; sauntering into her
boudoir from the Conseil d'état, to confide his little griev.
ances of public life, and listen in return to histories of
colours that would not blend, - canvass that would not
dry, - camellias that would not bud, -- or any other of
the trivialties that become important, when prattled about
by rosy lips to willing ears.
But her play and her work were alike done for her.
Her embroideries were bought ready stitched, her camellias
ready grafted. Her very album, instead of being extracted,
drawing by drawing and sonnet by sonnet, from her
friends with pain and anguish, like so many teeth, had
been laid on her dressing-table, one new year's morning,
filled with exquisite performances by Robert, Isabey,
Lemaître, Ingres, Guérin, Lemière. En un mot, as the
French say, after wasting a whole dictionary, there was
nothing left for her to do for amusement, — but mis-
chief !-
Pretty much the same thing that made my friend Byron,
at four-and-twenty, a misanthrope, converted Thérèse at
the same age into a femme incomprise.
Be it observed that no sooner had the noble poet a real
grievance to complain of, a wife who rejected him, and
a child from whom he was divided, than he ceased to
adorn his verses with anguish and remorse ; and Childe

Harold, really aggrieved, became the laughing, joyous,
devil-may-care Don Juan. I have a shrewd notion that
had the corpulent ex-Préfet taken to beating his wife, she,
too, would have renounced her green and yellow melan-
choly; and become, what nature intended her, an open-
hearted energetic creature, full of warm feellings and
resentments. Nay, had the prosperous conseiller d'état
become a bankrupt, or a traitor, in spite of his bulbous
outlines, she would have turned out a devoted wife! But
the poor soul wanted excitement. She wanted something
to prevent her sitting over her boudoir fire all winter,
or dreaming in her conservatory at Suresne all summer,
- gathering sweet pain
About her fancy till it thrilled again.
Unluckily for her, perhaps unluckily for me, she found
that something in Cecil Danby!
How happy she was, now that we occupied the post
of danger together. In what wbims and vagaries we
used to indulge! Word by word, sigh by sigh, I trans-
lated the “ Giaour” for her ; — Byron not having as yet
undergone at the hands of the French those rinsings
in cold water, by which they have managed to extract
all colour out of his poetry without effecting its purifi-
cation.
Like Othello, I told her campaigning tales that would
have filled volumes of the Standard Novels; and by dint
of plenty of orange-groves and quintas, modinhas and
seguadillas, made her free of the Peninsula, just as poor
Emily had talked me into ecstacy about Portugal, in the
old box at the Opera. —
While recounting my
Hairbreadth 'scapes in th’imminent deadly breach,
my adventures in conflagrated convents and slaughtered
villages, her pale cheek used to become gradually suffused,
and her mournful eyes animated. My story was reflected
in her face as in a camera obscura.
She was a capital listener ; — “an excellent thing in
woman,' and rare as excellent. An intelligent counte-
nance bent upon one while telling a story is positively
colloquial. What are the vulgar ejaculations of wonder

and satisfaction with which common-place people interrupt
a narrator, compared with the speaking blush, the flushing
glance, which, though no interruption, cries, “ Bravo !”—
or “ Alas !”- in accents not to be mistaken ?-
But the thing that delighted her most in all this, or the
thing which she said delighted her most, was my appre-
ciation of her power of entering into my joys and sorrows;
- my confidence in her — my reliance upon her friend-
ship.-I understood her, she said. With me she was not
la femme incomprise. She even indulged in certain little
Goetheisms about kindred souls, and our comminglement
of mind at Boulainvilliers, four-and-twenty years before.
It was not my cue to apprize her that I did not confide
in her ; that I told her only what I would have told to
the fellows at Watier's, and the brother officers of my
brigade ; or that I had bosom secrets, (memories of a
departed love, and grievances against a nominal father,)
which I would no more entrust to her keeping than to the
hands of the marble Atalanta, skimming in cold indecent
self-exposure along the gardens of the Tuileries.
Lady Ormington was often with us, so often, that we
called it always; and it might have been always, for there
was nothing in her presence that imposed silence upon our
mutual professions. Our Cupid was one of those hum-
bugging little boys who, because sans ailes, i. e. because
heavy and stupid, chooses to call himself “ l'Amitié et non
l'Amour.”
If I may be allowed to insinuate so much in a whisper,
I suspect that, had my indisposition been prolonged
another fortnight, he would have become l'Ennui. To
keep up with the overstrained exaltation of Thérèse, was
very much like the feat accomplished of late years by
Paganini, of playing on the fourth string a fantasia better
performed on the whole instrument. I was flattered, how-
ever. It was my delight to tutoyer the femme, no longer
incomprise. She, the cold, supercilious, Comtesse de la
Vrillière, insisted on being called Thérèse by an ex-Colonel
of Portuguese dragoons ! — Had I not reason to be proud,
had I not reason for protesting that, - but I blush to
write myself down so incomparable an ass !

Passons là dessus ! - Suffice it that it was a bore to one
or other of us when the time came for removing to the
Hôtel de Breteuil. But there was no help for it, though
the tears of Thérèse pattered down like showers of April
hail. Had not the Conseiller d’état taken to roll his eyes
like an ogre when he visited our infirmary, and to breathe
as hard as a hunted rhinoceros when he sonorously sucked
in his coffee with us after dinner, I doubt whether I
should have found courage to tear myself away.
CHAPTER V.
Malo me fortunæ pæniteat, quàm victoriæ pudeat.- Quint. Curt.
Honte à celui qui, déshérité de religion, ne voit dans la sainte confiance
d'une femme, qu'une âme à dépraver.-Michel RAYMOND.
Let my readers be so obliging as to recall to their minds,
unless the remembrance be already there present, that all
this occurred the year preceding the battle of Waterloo ;
when Englishmen maintained in Paris very different
ground from the position afterwards conceded to them.
As yet, the Cossacks had the crown of the causeway; and
even Louis XVIII. would not have dared exhibit towards
us any preference over his Muscovite pioneers to the
throne, or his Parisian supporters thereupon.
It behoved me, therefore, to do nothing to enrage Ana-
charsis, the great or big, as I had no means of securing his
misunderstood wife from his displeasure. Jealousy of her
preference was not likely to disturb his peace of mind;
but he would not have put up tamely with being made
ridiculous.
Except in humble life, indeed, French husbands are as
rarely betrayed into the honest resentment of jealousy, as
into any other breach of politeness. To a great extent,
self-esteem is their protection; to a greater, that “ un-
taught innate philosophy ” which prevents them from

I suspect, however, that more than one of those whom I
saw welcoming to their houses, with the utmost cordiality,
men whom, for their honour's sake, they were bound to
lay under the sod of Montmartre or Charonne, were en-
during the agony of the Spartan, with the gnawing fox hid
under his cloak. No anguish more bitter to bear than that
arising from some capitulation of conscience ; — which, un-
suspected by the world, is ever before us, like phos-
phorescent light shining the more vividly amid that gloom.
This is a long digression ; - more particularly as the
calèche of Thérèse, with its beautiful pair of bays, is wait-
ing to convey me to the Bois de Boulogne. Every day,
after I left her house, did she insist upon administering to
my airings ; my mother's carriage being a close one, and
air expressly advised for me. Just, therefore, as the poor
Duchesse de St. Barthélemy and Lady Ormington had
driven, day after day, on that very spot, past the self-same
haha of the Muette or wall of Bagatelle, five-and-twenty-
years before, did Thérèse and Cecil, the femme incom-
prise and the malade imaginaire, enjoy every afternoon, in
addition to each other's society, the delicious fragrance of
that wood of underwood, carpeted with violets and wild
anemones, and displaying between the tall stems of the
chesnut-trees whose great resinous buds were just opening
to disclose the pale green leaflets within, — thickets of
blackthori, bright with snow-white blossoms, and afford-
ing some excuse for the exulting notes of the linnets and
chaffinches making such a deuce of a fuss about the return
of spring.
All that sort of pastorality is charming in its proper
place. - Nobody likes it better than I do, within the
fourteen lines of a sonnet, — in the prose of Sir Philip
Sidney, or the occasional poetry of the Lady Melusindas of
the Book of Beauty, who have nothing else to write about.
But I hate a woman who talks daffodils and woodbines !

and shepherdesses ; and as for Gessner, should his works
ever be republished in this country, they will be illustrated
by Cruikshank, or Phiz. The only fidèle berger extant,
(besides the famous confectioner in the Rue des Lom-
bards,) is poor old Chateaubriand, who still drivels a bit
of lambkinism, now and then, in the season of green peas.
But even the old Vicomte is beginning to forswear his
crook! -
With these vulgar prejudices, it will be believed that I
was ill prepared for the eglantinian sweetnesses budding
from the gentle soul of Thérèse, as the primroses put
forth their leaves. I dare not say how great a bore ]
thought her. Having outgrown my first childhood, and
not achieved my second, I could see no very particular
necessity for being bound to the rack of fine sentiment,
while there was so good an opera in Paris, and such a variety
of capital restaurants.
By her own will, Madame la Comtesse would have had
me Haroldize to the very brink of misanthropy. I could
not, — for the life and soul of me I could not ! - If the
memory of her whose hair I still wore as a pledge of un-
availing affection, were incapable of exalting my imagina-
tion, not all the countesses of the Chaussée d’Antin could
screw me up to concert pitch. I had now recommenced my
vie de garçon. As soon as I grew strong again, breakfasts
at Tortoni's began the day, to conclude with a gay supper
at the Mille Colonnes ; and the Montagnes Russes, the
Salon, and fifty other brilliant follies, filled up the
interval.
I had, in fact, no longer any decent pretext for loitering
away my days in the boudoir or calèche of Madame la
Comtesse Anacharsis de la Vrillière, seeing that they were.
also those of Monsieur le Comte; and though by dint of
being called a monster of ingratitude fifty times a day,
either vivá voce, or on pink satin paper, I had begun to
consider myself a charming young man; even Lady
Ormington was fain to confess that I had every excuse
for my apparent remissness, in the hint afforded to me by
my gracious friend, the Duc de Berri, that I was endan-
gering the peace of mind of the corpulent ex- Préfet, by

exposing to the disapproval of Madame d'Angoulême the
conduct of his wife.
I scarcely know whether it were prudence on the part
of her ladyship, (who, being in the confidence of the
femme incomprise, was not only a frequent witness of her
crises de nerfs, but aware that she was susceptible of being
wound up to perpetrate the most unaccountable extrava-
gances, or whether some mysterious forewarning an-
nounced to her the return of the Emperor ; but, one fine
day, I found post horses to our travelling carriage, our
affairs wound up by the united exertions of Toady Richard-
son and Lady Ormington, and our passports and every-
thing else in readiness for departure.
I burst into remonstrances. I began to plead dinner
engagements, and all sorts of engagements, as an excuse
for doing what I liked. But my mother had an argu-
ment for immediate departure, against which there was no
contending. She protested that Lord Ormington was
alarmingly ill, and had ordered us home.
It was not till we were fairly ensconced in the little
parlour of the old Ship at Dovor, –a hostelry which well
deserved its name, for its rooms were cabins, — that she
told me the plain truth, (which was about as palatable as
other plain truths,) that she had employed subterfuge to
withdraw me from a spot where my fortunes and virtues
seemed to be following the course of the courage of Bob
Acres.
I was in a most unfilial rage !— The moment was ill
chosen to acquaint me that I had been made a fool of.
In the first place, I had all the reminiscences of the
steam packet fresh upon me. Any humane individual in-
troduced fire-proof into the terrors of Tophet, must
suffer, if possible, greater anguish than the damned.
How much more the healthy man on board a steam packet,
exposed to — but why nauseate my readers ? In the next
place, I had the irritation of finding myself dipping in the
dish with the “dam' d'honour."- In the third place,
after the exquisite course of gastronomy I had recently
been following, I was reduced to the aboriginal food of the
Britons; not exactly the bips, haws, and acorns of the

Saxon Heptarchy, - but worse, far worse, the beef-
steaks and apple-pie of an inn, — the culotte de peau grillé,
- the charlotte de pommes baked in a basin !- The waiter
asked me whether I pleased to take malt liquor ; while an
agreeable vapour of sulphur issuing from the dingy fire-
place, seemed to add a local colouring to the peculiar
emphasis of my execrations. — All was as the devil would
have it!-
People prose about the influence of education upon the
human mind;- talk to me of its power over the human
stomach!- It would require an abler pencil than mine to
depict the extraordinary delicacy that may be imparted to
the digestion, the exquisite discrimination to the palate ;
but let me briefly observe, that the whole mechanism of
the organs of deglutition may be trained and tutored, till
it becomes fine as that of Breguet's watches. More than
once on returning to England after long sojourn in France,
I have sustained a serious illness from the crudity of the
tough meats and parboiled vegetables. The thick sauces,
spiced into blackness, the horrible astringency of walnut
catsup pervading every made dish, has brought on the most
cruel derangement of the epigastric functions. Were I a
fire-eater, I would make money of the faculty by showing
myself at a fair ; not by swallowing cayenne and new
port, without "s poison” labelled on either dish or
decanter.
Now-a-days, indeed, the transition is less striking'; the
best French cookery being got up, and down, in London.
The haute cuisine of Paris is en décadence. The junior
branch of the Bourbons have done nothing for the cas-
serole ; and there has been serious talk of establishing a
bureau de pompes dinatoires on the model of that of the
pompes funèbres, where official or private dinners might
be regulated according to the tariff. – What a pendant to
the truly regal glories of the museum at Versailles !
At the period of which I am writing, however, the
Empire still dominated in the national institutions of
the land. All was great, or at least, grandiose.
Posterity has rendered justice to the legislative wisdom
of Napoleon. The empire has been called the triumph

of this and the triumph of that. The soldier twists his
moustache, and talks of the victoires et conquêtes of the
Petit Caporal. - The political economist praises the or-
ganization of his financial system ; – the legist quotes his
code ; the curé his réhabilitation of the church; - the
man of science, the man of letters, the artist, his protec-
tion of the academies : – and many a great name is
dragged out of the pocket of history, in confirmation
of their praise, which would never have found its way
there save under sanction of the fosterage of the Emperor.
In point of fact, the real triumph of his reign was its
gastronomy. The, greatest exploit accomplished by the
grande armée, was its march from one end of Europe to
the other, with the almanachs des gourmands in its sabre-
tache. Let them sing of the victorious Eagle flying from
clocher to clocher! - Reality is more sublime than
romance. The real perch of the Eagle was from spit to
spit! —
This is not vague assertion. The tone of an epoch is
indelibly impressed upon its literature. Look at that of
the Empire ! Look at the sleek periods of Joüy. — Does
not perdreau truffé exude from every line ! — Look at
the songs of Desaugiers, — of Beranger. — Could any
age that did not keep a good table produce such chan-
sons à boire ? - Grimod de la Reynière is one of the
conscript fathers of literature, - the originator of a style,
as much a creator in his way, as the authors of Fleur
d'Epine, or Vathek, or Waverley, or Childe Harold. -
Even the music of the days of Napoleon has a ring of
Sèvres dishes and champagne glasses in it. The Opéra
Comique has never had any thing so joyous as Joconde,
or the Calife de Bagdad !
Half the horrors of the prevailing school of French
literature, on the other hand, are attributable to the de.
cline of the cuisine : a moral indigestion consequent upon
a physical. Old Burton assigns the engendering of
melancholy chiefly to flatulence, in terms too matter-of-
fact for these matter-of-lying days; and just as the mon-
strosities of Monk Lewis's Tales of Wonder were traced
by the acumen of the reviewers to suppers of raw pork,

the flagrancies of the Spasmodic School arise from the
gritty dinners of Véfour, or the heterogeneous suppers of
the Café de Paris.
How different these fashionable gargotes from the really
classical temples of Beauvilliers, Véry, or Gacques ! -
Scarcely a trace remains of the restaurants of the Empire.
The Pavillon d'Hanovre is a haberdasher's,- the Café de
Mille Colonnes a theatre,~Robert's, afterwards Lointier's,
a new street, — Beauvilliers, a cluster of shops. Even
Grignon's exists no longer. Those days, when the table of
the Archi-chancelier Cambacérès was a vatican that ful-
minated its bulls, (in the form of bæuf à l'Italienne,) to
the uttermost ends of Europe, when the Maréchal de
France, returning ravenous from his campaigns to the
domestic hearth where simmered the pot au feu, afforded,
like Alexander, a premium to the man who would create
a new dish, and thus created the great school of the
Udes and Carêmes, — also brought back the famished
lieutenant, content to lavish the plunder of a village, or a
monarch's ransom, upon a dish of beccaficos!
From conquered countries, too, they brought back the
booty of new ideas. From Moscow, the charlotte russe ;
from Italy, the poulet à la Marengo. What have they
brought back from Algiers ? — a taste for raw dates, or
a recipe for stewing locusts ! — Alas! all that the cartes
of the Parisian restaurants have gained of late years, has
been what they write down at the Café de Paris, “ breed
sauce," “ soup of mutton,” and “ misies paës,” (which,
being interpreted, means mince pies,) an article of food
which Cromwell, the greatest lawgiver since Moses or
Mahomet, interdicted for the health-sake of his loving
people, just as those enlightened dictators prohibited the
flesh of swine.
For my part, had it been my fate to become top-sawyer
of any possible community, (and kings and princes turn
up so oddly in these vicissitudinous times, that one is
never sure of not waking some morning Tribune of the
Argentine Republic or Cacique of Poyais, — just as a
certain Belgian student used to say, on leaving the key of
his lodgings every day with his porter, “ Si l'on m'envoie

offrir la couronne de la Belgique, vous direz que j'y serai
dans une heure !”)— had it been my fate, as I observed
before this very long, though apposite parenthesis, to
become a governor of the people, I should have issued my
ukases on the principle upon which the gentleman won his
wager of making a donkey ascend the steep staircase of an
eight-story house in Edinburgh town, i, e., by pulling it
back stoutly by the tail, every time it reached a flat; on
which signal, with a becoming sense of its duties, the
jackass pushed forwards ! —
Even such was the policy which rendered the French
eaters of potatoes ! -
There was once on a time a certain Parmentier, who,
as his tomb in Père la Chaise will duly inform you, was a
great chemist and greater philanthropist, — the first to
introduce that admirable esculent, the potato, into la belle
France. Unluckily la belle France was destitute of the
true hermit-like appetite. As regarded the earth-apple, it
had heard, perhaps, the story of Queen Elizabeth's loving
subjects, who choked themselves with the seed, instead of
applying to the root of the matter ; or, more likely still,
entertained a secret contempt for murphies, as the food of
the shoeless and shirtless population of the green island,
i. e., the island green enough to run its head into an
English halter.
The cause of their antipathy is immaterial. The result
was, that though they consented to starch their lawns and
cambrics with Monsieur Parmentier's chemical products,
not a potato would they place in the mouths of any living
thing within their gates, save the quadrupeds to which we
have recently alluded as proscribed by the Mosaic and
Mahommedan dispensations. If they throw physic to the
dogs, they threw their potatoes, like physic, to their pigs !-
The worthy soul of Parmentier was in despair. The
word famine was just then more familiar in the ears of
both French and English than it has been of late years ;
as may be gathered from the historical anecdote of Marie
Antoinette, who on hearing that the people had no bread,
inquired why they did not eat pie-crust; - a speech ex-
ceedingly mal-interpreted by the English, unaware that

French pâtés are baked in a species of coarse dough not
intended to be eaten, — like the crust which, in families
that respect themselves, protects on the spit a haunch of
venison or saddle of mutton.
Parmentier, too Catholic in his spirit to restrain his
sympathies to haunches of venison, saddles of mutton, or
pâtés de gibier, was not to be deterred from the duty of
securing half-a-dozen millions of people from the chance
of starvation. He saw the lawgivers of the nation compel
them to swallow, for their own benefit, the corvée, — the
gabelle, — the guillotine, — and was determined, for his
own part, to make them swallow the potato !
With the aid of the Directory, accordingly, he obtained
permission to plant half-a-dozen acres with it, in the
Plaine de Sablons, close to Paris; and have the plantation
watched night and day, by soldiers with fixed bayonets,
ordered to put to death any feloniously-minded citizen,
presuming to lay a finger on that precious growth! To
steal a potato was hanging matter. The consequence was,
that within a year nothing but potatoes would go down.
The silk attire interdicted by sumptuary laws, became
doubly endeared to the belles of old England ; and the
food guarded by the artillery of government from the par-
ticipation of the populace, was of course regarded as manna
from Heaven. Old Parmentier died happy in having po-
tatofied France; and I have perpetrated a long story, in

CHAPTER VI.
Memini etiam quæ nolo : oblivisci quæ volo !--Cic.
Il y a des voix qui ne mentent pas. Les âmes sont à jour dans les grandes
occasions, et le doubte tombe quand elles se montrent.-MICHEL RAYMOND.
Nothing awkwarder than the first evening spent toge-
ther by the different members of a family united after
long absence, who feel it necessary to disguise from each
other, in polite hypocrisy, the extreme relief they have ex-
perienced in living apart. Both Lord Ormington, my
mother, and my Self, had enjoyed ourselves fifty times as
much as if we had been dwelling together in domestic
infelicity, in Hanover Square. But it would not do to
say so. Instead, therefore, of amusing each other with
the mutual recountal of our adventures, we sat stupid, and
said nothing. Had it not been for Miss Richardson, who
possessed the true toady capacity for the running-pattern
conversation that forms so admirable an arpeggio accom-
paniment to the solos, the séance must have been as silent
as those of the Abbé Sicard.
Luckily, Lady Ormington had a little grievance or two
to complain of. I have already mentioned that Lady
Harriet Vandeleur was only a few years her junior. Judge
of the indignation of my poor mother on finding the gay
widow accepted in Paris as a beauty, -- almost as a girl,
- while she was consigned to dowagerhood ! — It was
vain to represent to Lady Ormington that the special plea
which obtained this verdict in her little ladyship’s favour,
was her jointure ; that in France, so long as a woman is
on her preferment she is sure of being preferred. My
mother returned to the charge with “ Yes, I know they
all wanted to marry her — that is, marry her fortune. —
Still, I must say, I think it most extraordinary for a
woman of one or two-and-forty to be surrounded with
partners in every ball-room ; and a woman of four or five-
and-forty to be as invariably surrounded with chaperons.”
“ You must have noticed, however,” said I, “how
rapidly Lady Harriet's little group of suitors diminished,

when some good-natured English friend revealed the fatal
fact that she has only a life-interest in her fortune, and
forfeits part of that by a second marriage. Admiral de la
This, immediately asked for a ship and sailed for the
Mediterranean. General de la That, repaired to his com-
mand in the south, six weeks previous to the expiration of
his leave of absence; and divers peers of France retreated
to their holes of hotels, like poisoned rats, to die and poison
others in their turn." -
Lord Ormington seemed vexed that, instead of these
pribbles and prabbles touching our own country people, we
had not brought home a word or two of authentic intelli-
gence concerning the political position of France. Living
as my mother had done at the Château, and seeing with
its eyes, she of course did not hesitate to assure him that
the nation was Bourbon to its heart's core; that the
drapeau blanc was as dear to its affections as the white
table-cloth it so closely resembled ; and that were Napoleon
to land again in France, he would be torn to pieces by the
populace.
She spoke more prophetically, poor woman, than she
knew of. At that very moment, he had landed, and
they were tearing him to pieces with the warmth and
loyalty of their affection. The arms of Talleyrand were
already round his neck; and the authorities of the Capital
at his feet! -
All that his lordship had to offer in return for her
accurate political intelligence, was the information that
Danby's “ Life and Times of Bolingbroke” was pro-
nounced by the “Quarterly Review” as good as if written
by Bolingbroke himself; and those who were fawned upon
by the “ Quarterly Review” of those days, – the Q. R. of
Gifford, whose sarcasms were arsenic, and whose praise
nepenthe, — were deified by the multitude, just as of old
some slave, whose hand was licked by a lion of the arena,
to whom he had been flung as a victim.
“I must say,” observed Lady Ormington, “I think it
a vulgar thing of Danby to write a book. — What good
can it do him? — A man writes for money or distinction.
- What can be Danby's object ? - He don't want to be

made a Baronet ; he don't want to increase his income.
Where can be the use of writing ?”
Where can be the use to the aloe of its flower, - to
the mine of its gold, — would be just as reasonable an
argument. But Lady Ormington saw, heard, and felt
with the eyes, ears, and understanding of the least intel-
lectual coterie in the world ; and did not perceive that the
human mind must bring forth fruits after its kind, in due
season.
I was amused, meanwhile, to perceive how well Lord
Ormington was beginning to bear with me. He had long
given up the foolish demonstrations of enmity whereby he
had caused me to regard my elder brother as the elder
son of Adam regarded his younger. And so, to do her
justice, had Lady Ormington, who was almost as courteous
to Danby, as her lord to me. This arose, however, on her
part, from a considerable modification of her partiality
towards the boy of the cockade ; while the pride of her
lord in his future representation, remained unabated. He
was as passionately attached to Danby and his offspring,
as I to that lonely grave at Cintra !
The feeling of grand-paternity is, I sincerely believe,
(next to the love of a young child for its mother,) the
most instinctive of all human affections. It is, in fact,
the earliest indication of the simplicity of second child-
hood. One of the most difficult points to determine in
the course of our mortal career, is the exact commencement
of the decadence of our faculties. Decay of body speaks
in a language no one can misunderstand. The cane, the
crutch, the spectacle case, the wig, the set of minerals, are
too peremptory in their parts of speech to admit of turning
a deaf ear to their warning. But with respect to the de-
cline of our faculties, we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us: and we go twaddling on, - from the wool.
sack, — the pulpit, ---- the bench, – the bar, - without in
the slightest degree suspecting that we are seen to drivel.
Even I, though perfectly aware that at the Clubs I am
called “ old Danby,” and that Crockford's begin to con-
sider “ Cis" too familiar an abbreviation for one who no
longer masticates with his own grinders, am, nevertheless,

very much puzzled to know whether, in these my memoirs,
I am beginning to potter, or whether my gentle readers
are exclaiming, “ poor old soul ! how he repeats him-
self.” If I had a grandchild, I should know that it was
my cue to be in my dotage. I should find myself repeat-
ing the witticisms of little Harry or little Jane, instead of
reverting to Lord Votefilch, or la femme incomprise ! -
Independent of the use of grand-paternity as a moral
lesson, there is something peculiarly endearing in a little
creature who wears our image and superscription, without
entailing upon us those duties of reprehension and flagella-
tion, which render the office of papa and mammaship
anything but a sinecure. Grandchildren are the shadows,
or the foreshowing of the shadows, we cast before us into
future centuries ; - our link to posterity, our investment
in the future, a bark of Columbus, which we have
launched for a voyage of discovery upon the Atlantic
ocean of time.
I suspect that, independent of the favour which Lord
Ormington could not but accord to a little fellow so hand-
some and promising as my nephew, he regarded him as
a sort of page bestowed by Providence for the duty of
upholding his peer's robes in the eyes of a succeeding
generation ; -a telescope through which he pretended to
contemplate Ormington Hall in the twentieth century, -
a speaking trumpet, whereby he trusted to announce his
own consequence to the Britons of the days of Albert I.
It was not incumbent upon him to scold the boy when he
broke a Dresden tea-cup, as he had been forced to do poor
squinting John, to satisfy the antipathies of my mother.
He could allow the little fellow to be as wilful as other
fine children of three years old, and not feel himself ac-
countable for Arthur's sins to Solomon, Dr. Watts, or
Hannah More. - On any symptoms of nursery rebellion,
he might allow himself to say, like Herries, on being told
of a corn-riot at Hull or Truro, -" That is the affair of
the Home department.”—
It would have been difficult not to spoil that boy;
For from the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
There was not such a gracious creature born!

His deep, loving, blue eyes, — his clustering curls, - his
graceful symmetry, -- had attracted the notice of more
than one artist of eminence; and I find myself spared the
necessity of enlarging upon his graces, by the descriptive
words of one of the most pure and natural of our modern
poets.
That little one, that gentle one, that simple child of three,
I'll not declare how bright and fair his little features be,
Or how silver sweet his infant tones as he prattles on my knee.
His little heart's a fountain pure of kind and tender feeling,
And his ev'ry look's a gleam of light, rich depths of love revealing.
When he walks forth, the country folk, who pass him in the street,
Will shout for joy and bless the boy, he looks so mild and sweet.
A playfellow is he to all, and yet with cheerful tone
He sings his little song of love when he is left alone;
His presence is like sunshine sent to gladden home and hearth,
To comfort us in all our griefs and sweeten all our mirth!
On visiting Forest Lodge, where Danby and his wife
were spending the Easter holidays, I found that, now
Bolingbroke was in print, and the Honourable Member for
Rigmarole at leisure, the little fellow was becoming as
great a pet with his father as he had long been of his
uncle and grandfather. Lady Susan again promised to
become a mother. Yet with her, as with the rest of us,
Arthur was all in all.
The spring was far advanced ; and that modest home
of my brother's was, in springtime, a bower of Eden. Of
all places where the gioventù dell'anno assumes a smiling
appearance, none more propitious to its charms than a
venerable forest. The transition from the hoar antiquity
of those ancient trees, to the tender verdure suddenly en-
clothing them with shell-like leaflets or snowy blossoms, is
like a sudden bursting out of sunshine in some gloomy
valley, - a bright and auspicious rejuvenescence, --- how
exquisitely exemplified among the old oaks and beeches of
Windsor Forest.
The wild flower laying
Its fairy gem beside the giant tree,-
the wood-sorrel with its crysophrase verdure,—the ophrys,
with its balsamic odours, – the wild hyacinths, glimmering
like sapphires in the brakes
Where the snake casts its bright enamelled skin,

served to variegate the scene, whose gradually deepening
bowers seemed formed of such transparent foliage that the
light came down, scarcely subdued through the —
Reader! I most humbly ask your pardon,- I feel that
I am forgetting myself and you. I promised you, like
Plato, to banish poets from my republic. Take therefore
for granted, that, eclogues apart, the hoary moss grew as
good as new ; and that even the venerable holly-bushes,
the least life-like of all the trees of the forest, were look-
ing, as one says to some crusty old bachelor from whom
one expects a legacy, as young and fresh as a four year
old, when Danby and I sallied forth for our daily
saunter, either on foot or pony, gossiping as we went, —
ever of far countries, or far times,- for an uneasy feeling
seemed to connect us with the passing hour.
Danby was just the fellow to trouble himself about
Polynesian researches, and speculate concerning Utopias
founded upon our penal colonies, — to dream of noble
cities established at Swan River on the principle of that
scapegoat from the gallies and the marshes, Havre de
Grace; or to foresee a future nation, great as that push-
on-keep-moving-people, the Go-a-heads, — rising like the
Go-a-heads, out of the excrement of the mother country,
-- Jonah's gourd generated by a dunghill.-
I, on the contrary, had my pretty little anecdotes to
relate of the frivolities of the Tuileries; which saw in the
great kingdom it was recalled to govern, only a country
which grew its own truffles, and bottled its own Clos de
Vougeot; or of the vexation of the nation which had be-
trayed an Emperor in the hope of establishing a republic,
only to crown a King !-
Danby philosophized in good set terms upon these data.
I forget what he said about it; one always forgets things
that are said in good set terms. The wisdom that is let
fall, is always surest to be picked up; as the gorgeous
Buckingham at the court of Anne of Austria, gained more
credit by the jewels he wore ill set, that they might be
scattered to attract notice, than by the finer brilliants
ostentatiously displayed in his cap. I remember thinking,
whenever Danby was conversing with me, that it was a

243
pity so much good prose should be wasted. His well-
turned periods would have filled a capital page in his
History of the Life and Times of Bolingbroke, - neither
out of date nor out of place. - For the natural history of
kings and countries is the same in all ages, like the natural
history of fleas or lions, — garden bugs or buffaloes.-
I scarcely know whether Danby derived most satis-
faction from his success in public, or in domestic life.
The two feelings were so consolidated in his heart, - the
popular author of the Quarterly and the happy husband
and father of Forest Lodge, were so inextricably Siamese
Twinified into homogeneity,- that an injury sustained by
either had been death to the sensibilities of the other.
Scarcely possible for a man to enjoy a happier frame of
existence than Danby's; not only solaced by “ the con-
cealed comforts of a man locked up in woman's love," or
the self-sufficient triumph of floating double, like “ the
swan on still St. Mary's lake," upon the placid stream of
life; but because tranquil in body and mind, with the
mighty repose of the Farnesian Hercules, secure in his
tranquil strength because holding in his hand the golden
fruit of the tree of knowledge. A very great mind is
seldom restless. It is into the depths of still water that
the divers plunge fearlessly, certain of bringing up pearls
such as Cleopatra might have matched with her “ pendants
worth a province ;" while the roaring ocean throws up only
tatters of weed, or fragments of wreck.
My eyes were still dazzled with the gorgeousness of the
Parisian ball-rooms, when I took refuge in his calm, holy,
philosophical retreat “on the skirts of the forest ;” with
the sensation of relief one finds in a soft, grey, mild,
autumnal day, after the scorching radiance of summer.
The spring was not so forward but that we were glad to
gather round the fire of an evening, after Arthur had held
up his pomegranate-bud of a mouth to be kissed, before
he was marched off to bed. The lounging-chairs were
drawn round. Danby's great white dogs (resembling
those we see in the frescoes of Paul Veronese), instead of
stretching their lazy length on the hearth-rug, used to
plant themselves among us, gazing upon the glowing logs,

as if listening through their canine reverie to my brother's
reasoning upon the last new topic of the half-cut periodical
or half-digested evening paper. There we used to sit and
gossip. It was impossible to feel envious of the supe-
riority of such a mind, which, like the sun, shone only to
cheer and fertilize. I saw, without humiliation, that I,
who had roamed the world, and beheld man in his various
patterns and mouldings, — who had visited the galleries of
art and majestic institutions of foreign countries, knew less
of what I had seen, than Danby, upon hearsay, or print-
say. While apparently bounded by the narrowness of
his monotonous domesticity, his intellectual horizon was
illimitable; while I, carrying with me wherever I wan-
dered, the littleness of my own soul, had scarcely elbow-
room for thought, so bounded was the compass of my
views.
There is something, to be sure, in the consciousness of
stability. It is only when the vessel is lying at anchor,
that her appointments are smartened up and rendered
ship-shape. Danby was not only at anchor, but in a
harbour fair as those of Naples, or the Golden Horn ; and
the flowers had no choice but to expand in the sunshine,
where not an angry breath had leave to blow. I, on the
contrary, was a scatterling on the mountain side, blown
about by the tempests, —- Snowed upon, rained upon. -
Like one of those floating webs of gossamer one sees upon
the evening air, as if evermore in search of the setting
sun, I lived in a state of vague expectation of being caught
by some bush, and endowed with a local habitation. I
trusted to Destiny, — the blind goddess compared with
whom the blind god is a lynx, — to accomplish something
for me worthy my imperceptible deserts.
Like many more people than choose to own it, I have
passed through life waiting for some one, — watching for
something, - I scarcely knew what; like the letters by
the post,” – those “ airy creatures” which a man who
wants an excuse for staying at a place he ought to leave,
is sure to be expecting. — My post, alas ! has brought me
no letters. — Day after day, month after month, year after
year, I have still been waiting, still been watching: -

my aimless destiny unaccomplished, - eternity flowing
through my hand like the limpid waters of a fountain
through the unconscious, unenjoying lips of some marble
Triton ? — The tuneful Nine again! The curse of Crom-
well on them and all their metaphors ! I must certainly
have been bitten by a mad sonneteer, at one of my friend
Lydia White's cerulean soirées ! But since from the ridicu-
lous to the sublime there is but a step, let us return from
my prosaic poetry to the poetical prose of Forest Lodge.
I swear I never felt more joyous than when rising every
morning from the breakfast-table presided over by Lady
Susan, — cheerful, elegant, fair, kindly, - participating
with intimate cordiality in our anticipations of the sport
or business of the day, — disdaining nothing that we
enjoyed, enjoying nothing that we disdained ! - What an
embellishment is such a woman to the wilderness of life!
- Even I, who in the strife and turmoil of the world's
vices had almost lost the power of distinguishing good
from evil, whose conscience was deaf and dumb, impassive
amid the fret and seething of human passion as a rock
planted in the bed of a river, causing the waves to boil
and eddy but remaining scornfully immovable, - even I
was deeply touched by the holy and hallowing influence of
this gentlest of wives and mothers ! -
There was an old cedar-tree on the lawn at Forest
Lodge, under whose drooping branches I have seen her sit
on sunny afternoons, with her youngest child sleeping on
her knee ; – the babe, the mother, the massive shadows of
the venerable tree, all so still and motionless, that it
required no great stretch of imagination to fancy oneself
looking at the Riposo in Egypt, painted by some great
master. All the truth of Parmigiano, all the grace of
Correggio, were concentrated in the little group !
Why is it I dwell thus loiteringly upon the picture of
their domestic happiness ? — or why did I enter so fer-
vently into the refined simplicity of their existence, that
not even the enthusiasm with which it was pointed out to
my admiration by Lord Ormington, sufficed to disgust me
with them and theirs ? — One evening, after I had spent
half-a-dozen happy days among them, and was beginning

to be as much at home as the sturdy hounds maintaining
their chartered place within our circle, the boy was come
to toy away among us those last few minutes before bed-
time, so endeared to all children by the inherent frailty of
human nature, rebellion against the constituted authority
of the nurse, and ambition of conquering a few moments
more of interdicted enjoyment. There he was, --- little
joyous fellow, - passed lovingly from knee to knee, -
questioned by each of us in succession, with the view of
eliciting the treasures of a spirit bright as the souls of
children, whereupon still lingers the effulgence of the
eternal Dayspring from whence they have so lately
emanated.
His father's hand lingered among the clustering curls of
that little head, as if striving to develope in the happy face
he drew down towards him as the boy clambered upon his
bosom, unnoted indications of the faculties brightening its
fairness. Lady Susan kept calling to her husband to be
careful of Arthur's footing, as the father and child sported
thus lovingly with each other. Lord Ormington said
nothing; but sat watching them, proud of the beauty of
the boy, — the distinctions of the man ; – and prouder of
both that they were so closely and manifestly his own.
“ And so, sir,” said Danby, with his eyes fixed on the
boy, as though to devour every movement and gesture of
his graceful nature; “ and so, sir, you have been in the
boat to-day with uncle Cecil ? ” —
“Ay, but naughty uncle Cecil would'nt find Arthur the
nest!" said the child, hiding his little curly head in his
father's bosom. “Uncle Cecil promised Arthur to go and
find a nest among the rushes, and then he brought Arthur
home again because there was no nest! - Uncle Cecil
broke his word. — Papa and mamma never break their
words.”—
"Never mind, my boy; we will try again another
time," said I, turning to explain, in a few words to Lord
Ormington, that a day or two before I had found a reed-
tit's nest among the rushes of the reservoir ; but that not
having marked the spot, I had been unable to find it again
on my expedition with Arthur. “The sun was gone in,"

said I, “and I thought it too chilly for him to remain
longer on the water, while punting the boat among the
reeds.”
“I was not cold, though," – persisted the disappointed
child. “You know, you promised me I should see a
pretty little nest hung among the reeds, with two green
eggs in it, and a little bird flying about to take care of it. -
But there was no nest, and no bird, and no eggs. - You
broke your word !” —
“You might have caught cold,” said I, to soften his
little pouting resentments.
“ No, no, - I guess all about it. — I heard Coulson tell
my nurse the other day, that mamma was very wrong to
trust Arthur in the boat with you; and that for his part
he should'nt be surprised if harm came of it. - What did
Coulson mean, uncle ? — Nurse told Coulson to take care
how he said such things, for that I should come and tell
you again, — What did Coulson mean? ~ He said you
always pretended to be glad to see me, but that you would
be gladder still to see the last of me.”
All this time, Danby was vainly endeavouring to stop
the prattle of the child by his caresses. But like all
darlings, Arthur chose to be heard to an end. I know not
which of us looked most uncomfortable before that end was
attained ; my brother, or Lady Susan, or Lord Ormington.
For this same officious Mr. Coulson was no other than
mine ancient enemy of the pigtail, - Lord Ormington's
own man.
Danby ended where he had better have begun, by
carrying off the child in his arms to bed ; trying to drown
in the noise of a playful altercation about kissing mamma,
and grandpapa, and uncle Cecil, the extreme awkwardness
of our relative position. I thought he seemed to hesitate
as he approached me in my turn, as if doubting my
inclination to bestow upon the little fellow my usual
nightly kiss; whereupon I stretched out my arms to give
him a fervent embrace, Danby's eye met mine as I
pressed my lips to his soft white forehead; and I could
detect a glance of grateful feeling towards me for not
resenting the boy's innocent offence. - How often the

sensation of pressing my lips to that round, smooth, warm,
and glossy brow, recurred afterwards to my recollection !
When Danby and the boy aad quitted the room,
(Lady Susan following them with some parting charge to
be delivered to the nurse about the little girl,) a dead
silence ensued between Lord Ormington and myself.
Those few witless words of Arthur's had sufficed to sum-
mon up betwixt us the ghost of old times, — the spectre of
our mutual antipathy! – I verily believe that both of us
counted the minutes till my brother's return. But when
once Danby got into the nursery, so many endearments
were bestowed upon him to cajole him into staying, that
one was never sure of seeing him again.
It was not till summoned by the announcement of
dinner, that he and Lady Susan made their appearance ;
and then their manner was so constrained that I plainly
saw they had been talking over the best mode of covering
the impertinence of the servants and the indiscretion of
the little fellow. — I had never felt their kindness oppressive
before ; for it was disagreeably evident that they were
labouring to efface any painful impression that might have
been made upon my feelings.
Next morning, matters were worse. Our pursuits had
been hitherto so simultaneous, our plans so unstudied, that
I felt more at home in Danby's house than in Hanover
Square. But now Lady Susan was so earnestly attentive,
that I determined to return to town that very afternoon.
Lord Ormington was off already; not in consequence of
the little contre-temps that had occurred at Dropmore, but
because previously engaged to spend the two remaining
days of the Easter holidays.
“Stay, at all events, till to-morrow, Cecil,” remonstrated
Danby ; " for I am obliged to go to Windsor to look at a
pair of horses the coachman is plaguing me about, and
Susan will be left alone.”
This was only a kind pretext for detaining me four-
and-twenty hours longer ; but, being as eager to accept the
olive branch as he to offer it, I stayed. After luncheon,
he mounted his horse and rode off; while I offered my
arm to my sister-in-law, for a saunter in the forest, into

which there was an entrance through the shrubbery. It
was a bright spring day. The air was all astir with life
and spirits. All nature seemed in activity. The birds
were darting about with straws in their beaks; and I
fancied I could see the leaves expanding under the bright-
ness of the sunshine. Lady Susan was an unfailingly
agreeable companion. There was no effort in her conver-
sation, — nothing overstrained in the tone of her mind.
She was so simply pious and calmly wise, that one accepted
her remarks and comments without challenge. She seemed
so serenely penetrated with the truth of what she advanced,
that one felt she must be in the right.
It is a mighty pleasant thing to saunter with a gentle
intelligent woman along the mossy paths of an old forest,
on a budding spring day, with a dear child in whose im-
pulses of health and animation you take mutual delight,
bounding on before you in search of violets; or with his
little hand resting on the sturdy back of a fine old hound,
such as Snyders would have turned dogstealer to paint.
I was exceedingly happy. We talked of Danby. She had
a thousand traits to relate of the homage tendered to him
by the master-spirits of the age ; and I listened with
pleasure to the peculiar intonation of her voice, as it
recorded the praises of her husband.
Her situation did not admit of taking very long walks ;
so that we returned home much sooner than suited the
restlessness of the boy. Lady Susan was obliged to threaten
the wilful fellow with the privation of some promised
plaything, (a wheelbarrow, I think, which his father was
to order for him at Windsor,) unless he submitted. Before
we reached the garden, however, I had compromised the
business, not by a threat, but a bribe. I had previously
agreed to ride and meet Danby; and promised the boy to
take him before me on my saddle to surprise papa. No
sooner had I made the offer than I repented ; for I saw a
deep flush suffuse the cheek of my gentle companion. But
Arthur's expectations once excited, were not to be re-
pressed ; and Lady Susan gave her consent, partly, I
suspect, lest the disagreeable incident of the night before,
should seem to influence her decision.

The horse was brought round. Arthur, his little eyes
beaming with delight, was lifted up to me, after I had
taken my seat, and, though I saw that his mother, who
stood at the hall door to see us off, looked anxious and
nervous, the exultation of the spirited little fellow, whose
voice was ringing and eyes glittering with gladness, com-
municated itself to me; and I set off as joyously along the
Windsor road as though it were my own first ride, and not
my little nephew's.
“Papa, papa! — what will papa say? - How we shall
surprise dear papa !” — was all that Arthur could utter,
while enjoying the novel sensation of seeing the hedges fly
past, as we speeded along at a gentle trot.
"You see Uncle Cecil, they could trust you to take care
of me! ” said Arthur, just as we reached Sandpit Gate.
-“Coulson was a foolish old man, — wasn't he ?"
I had expected, according to Danby's arrangements, that
we should meet him before we proceeded so far; and now
proposed to return. But the boy would not hear of it.
“Let us wait here, uncle Cecil, – pray, pray let us wait
here !— Papa will not be long. — Papa never breaks his
promises !” — cried Arthur.
We waited accordingly. Five minutes elapsed, but no
signs of Danby: I began to get fidgetty, and so did the
mare. But the boy begged earnestly; and there was
something so endearingly earnest in the clasp of his little
hand, that I could not find it in my heart to say “no.”
“What, won't you stay another minute if Arthur loves
you very — very — much?” – was uttered in a tone of
infantine cajolery there was no resisting. It was the plea of
a child conscious of his hold upon the affections of many.
As the afternoon, though bright with April sunshine,
was growing chilly, I would not loiter longer at the gate,
but proceeded at once into the park. When lo ! as if the
demons themselves had ordered it, scarcely had I reached
the first clump of beech trees overshading the road, when
an orderly of the Blues, either on important duty, or run
away with by his charger, passed us at full gallop towards
the lodge.
The mare irritated by long detention at the gate, fretted

by its unusual burthen, or frightened at the clang of
military accoutrements, became suddenly restive! I was
totally unprepared for the first plunge, and the child was
nearly thrown from the saddle. Clutching his dress tightly
in one hand, I strove to restore his balance and retain my
own. But the cries of the little fellow, and the eager-
ness with which he clung to the mane, served still more
to terrify the accursed brute.
Why enter circumstantially in to details ? — I have little
fear of incriminating myself in the eyes of the reader, by
the appearance of carelessness or want of skill. — Any
human being who is really human, will readily believe
that I did my best, my earnest best, to forestal the
catastrophe.
Even after all these years, it is so bitter to my feelings
to revert to the event, that I have difficulty in tracing even
this slight description. Unspeakable was the agony of my
feelings when, at the lapse of a minute, I felt myself
losing hold of the boy, who had already received a dreadful
and crushing blow from the horse's head, as it reared and
plunged in insane fury.-- There seemed only the alterna-
tive of having the precious child dashed from my imperfect
grasp upon the road, and probably trampled under the
horse's feet; or of saving him, by flinging him carefully
upon the soft grass. —
I acted according to the suggestion of my poor judg-
ment. The next moment, I congratulated myself on what
I had done; for the beast, lightened of its unaccustomed
burthen, set off at full speed. I had not had such a race
since the business in the Bois de Boulogne ; and re-
membering the sequel of that memorable event, was pre-
pared to find a sudden crash put a term to my luckless
exploit. Two horsemen, whom I passed on the road,
made matters worse, by attempting to stop my horse just
as I had all but regained command over its mouth. It
started off, however, anew; nor was it till five minutes
afterwards, that I found myself, breathless almost as the
panting animal, attempting to explain what had happened
to Danby, whom I met scarcely a second after the brute
had given in.--I found it difficult to make him understand

me.--Arthur, little Arthur ! - on horseback — thrown -
lying on the road? — Impossible ! -
Both were in a state of agony beyond the power of
language to describe, as we returned towards the spot. No
person had passed to afford help. The two horsemen had
followed me, and were still in our rear. The child lay
where he had fallen. From a distance, we saw the white
motionless speck upon the green tur. — He was probably
too much terrified to move ! - God grant he might be too
much terrified to move !-Oh! moment of agony and
terror!
We reached the spot, and still he stirred not. — He lay
quietly on his side upon the grass, as he might have laid
himself down to sleep.- Nothing unusual in his attitude ;
- nothing to inspire further alarm. - Further alarm ?
Could there, - could there — be a greater than the panic
which congealed the whole current of my blood, as I
watched Danby, more dead than alive, bend over him,-
lift him gently from the ground - then, fling himself and
the burthen prest to his bosom, wildly together upon the
grass !-
A single glance had revealed all to him as it now did to
me. - The little fellow's arms hung down nerveless, as his
still warm body was strained to his father's heart. Drops
of blood were trickling from his lips.-His eyes were still
open, - but fixed and lustreless. — Spare me, kind reader !
- He never stirred again!
What a return home !-- What an evening !-How shall
I render justice to the noble conduct of my brother !-No
being of a higher sphere could have judged more equitably,
or borne himself more patiently, though tortured to an
indescribable degree of anguish. I would fain throw a
veil over the frenzy of the parents, as over my own. Poor
promising infant,- poor murdered boy! His blood was
on my head ; and when, after laying the body on the little
couch, I divested myself of the garments dabbled with that
innocent blood, I could scarcely have felt more guilty had
I been his assassin, instead of a mourner who would wil-
lingly have sacrificed life and limb to bring him back to
his distracted mother.

An express was instantly despatched to Dropmore. In
less than three hours Lord Ormington arrived. We were
assembled beside the bed where lay the body of the child ;
already white and rigid as marble, a sweet smile over-
spreading his little features, as though the angel were
grateful for having escaped so early and so unsullied to a
more genial sphere. Still there was horror mingled with
that touching beauty. On the white pillow where lay
that little head, was a purple streak. The fair curls were
clotted and stiffened over the forehead, whose warm touch
of the preceding night still lingered on my lips; and the
distracted nurse who stood by aggravating the despair of
poor Danby by her comments, kept pointing out, in
cruel detail, the injuries her nursing had sustained, - the
agony in which he must have rendered up his blameless
soul! -
It was well that they were able to prevent Lady Susan
from entering the chamber of death, still strewn with his
playthings. Danby had the little cold white hand pressed
within his own as he knelt beside the bed, when Lord
Ormington entered the room. Never shall I forget the
haggardness of his face as he approached us.—Never shall
I forget the piteousness of the old man's look as he cast
his eyes upon the smiling countenance of the dead. The
sobs that burst out of the depths of his heart, sounded as
if forced from a breast of iron. He did not affect to
repress his feelings. His glance towards myself when I
attempted to moderate his grief lest his mournful cries
should reach the chamber of Lady Susan, was like the
glare of a beast of prey.
I could hear imprecations muttered between his clenched
teeth. Let me not record the horrible words intermingled
with his curses! If he called me murderer,-if he called
me - no! I will not repeat them !-

Atque imploranti similis.
I throw myself on the compassion of the reader.

CHAPTER VII.
Qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus
Nunc ruit ad terras, scapulosque superjacet undam
Spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam :
Nunc rapidus retro, atque æstu revoluta resorbens
Saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relinquit.
Æneid.
Metaphysics, mountains, - lakes, - love unextinguishable, - thoughts
unutterable, and the nightmare of my own delinquencies,-
BYRON.
I HAVE no right to inflict upon others more than this
slight outline of a family affliction such as falls to the lot
of few ; — such as could have fallen to the lot of none
more capable of sustaining it with heroism, than my
brother. He was able to thank Heaven as for an act of
mercy when, the following day, Lady Susan was pro-
nounced to be safe, after giving birth to a dead son. —
Another son ! -
I will advert no further to this piteous epoch of my life.
Had it not been for the generous sympathy of my brother
and sister, I could not have survived the cruel insinuations
of Lord Ormington, or the still more agonizing reproaches
of my own mind. I saw the scowl of the ancient domes-
tics of the family directed towards me. I perceived all
the jealous hatred of Lord Ormington revive. I, the
changeling, was become his heir again; or rather, according
to his malignant suspicions, had made myself his heir
again : - I, the interloper in his family, — the exter-
minator of its dearest hopes. A tigress, bereft of its young,
could not have been more recklessly ferocious than the
bereaved grandfather of that lamented boy !
Enough ! — Be my sufferings, whether from grief or
indignation, surmised by every generous heart. I ceased
to be Lord Ormington's inmate. I could no longer sit
with patience at his board. My income was so secured
that nothing brought us of necessity into contact. I deter-
mined to quit England. Lauding the gods that one portion
of the Continent, at least, remained open, though France

was once more closed against English intrusion, I hurried
from the sound and sight of all familiar things.
I felt that the excitement of military enthusiasm, which
on a former occasion had roused my mind from the stupor
consequent on deep affliction, might perhaps renew its
beneficent influence. The talons of the Eagle of France
were matched once more against the paw of the Leopard of
England. Great armies were in the field; a great cause
was at stake. I flew to Brussels. I fought as a volunteer
at Waterloo, — unsuccessfully, — for the object of my
soldiership was release from a life of torture. In place of
the death I sought, a wound, not even dangerous, though
involving a long, tedious, and painful recovery, served only
to increase the measure of my sufferings.
My name was mentioned with honour in the despatches ;
and even at one's last gasp one is never sorry to see oneself
in print. I had often expected to obtain less honourable
mention in that Alpha and Omega of public life, — the?
Gazette.
Indupedita suis fatalibus omnia vinclis.
Fortune seemed determined to make a hero of me.
I may permit myself to observe, by the way, that we
Waterloo men had not the least idea, at the time, of the
eminence of our heroism. We did not foresee that our
valiant deeds were stereotyped for the use of posterity.
As regarded myself, my soul was too embittered for
even the soothings of vanity. The surgeons who watched
over my recovery, noting the feverish variations of my
temperament, often went away desponding; so completely
was their skill neutralized by the workings of my mind.
They even fairly apprized me, — SO soon as I gained
strength enough to be entrusted with the ordering of my
destinies, – that nothing but the absence of excitement,
moral or physical, would perfect my convalescence. They
recommended change of air and scene, — interdicted my
project of rejoining the army in Paris, — and advised
me either to return to my natal air, or take up my abode,
during the autumn, in some tranquil spot in one of the
Rhenish principalities.

The project was a tempting one, even to my then
untemptable nature. The Rhine was not the vulgarized
and Charing Cross-like thoroughfare it has since become.
It was not desecrated by steamboats. — It was not infested
by the plague of frogs and flies, the hopping, buzzing
English, who have caused the savour of beefsteaks to reek
from all its post-houses. There was not so much as a
Guide-book to rob one of the pleasant uncertainties of
travel. The wanderer took his chance, the very chance
which renders a wandering life agreeable. If he chose to
go and eat a bad dinner at the Golden Lamb, when the
Wine Bush was the best inn in the place, no need to revile
himself for obstinacy; no need to know better. He
could plead ignorance. The good or evil renown of
either had never reached him at his dinner-table at the
Alfred.
It is one of the curses of the times I have been fated to
survive to, that Europe, Asia, Africa, and America have
become itinerarized. From the banks of the Wye to the
shores of the Hudson or Bosphorus, we know every-thing
we are to see in foreign parts, as distinctly as if we had
viewed the scene in one of Burford's panoramas. Not a
dark point in the landscape, - not a suspicious lane, -- not
an inn of dubious reputation, John Murray, - confound
him ! — has much to answer for, beside the burning of
Byron's journal. He has not left us one mysterious nook
in which to niche a romance; and, were poor Mrs. Rad-
cliffe to revive, she might as well attempt to conjure up
horrors about Islington Hill as about the Appenines,
- the Pyrenean or the river Po.
- No doubt we shall soon have folding maps of the moon,
Mogged or Tegged for the touring season ; that is, pro-
vided Sir Francis Head, or Miss Costello, or some other
lively traveller will undertake the writing it up,—or Heath
select the Lunar Regions for his next year's Picturesque
Annual.
Unprepared for the beauty of the scenery awaiting me,

breitstein, — now, alas ! as trim and smooth as Woolwich
barracks. I resolved to pass a week or two at Coblentz ;
chiefly for the purpose of contemplating its sublimity of
desolation reflected on the blue serenity of the Rhine.
An inexplicable sympathy attracted me towards everything
on which the breath of adversity had seemed to blow.
Coblentz was one of those unhappy frontier towns, —
half frog, half tadpole, — half French, half German, —
which Napoleon Gallicized, — which the triumph of the
Allies re-Germanized, the re-appearance of the Emperor
re-Frenchified; — and which was consequently now ex-
piating by the infliction of a Prussian garrison, the sin of
having thrown up its hat a second time in honour of the
Emperor. As a counterbalance to this misfortune, Co-
blentz may boast of being one of the favoured cities, (I call
it city for civility's sake, for, in truth, it has no pretensions
beyond those of a substantial town,) to which nature has
assigned a prepossessing countenance ; – the features being
comely rather than sublime, and, above all, the complexion
wholesome,
A confluence of streams is pretty sure to embellish a
landscape ; and between the majestic cliffs on one shore,
and the spreading pastures and feathery poplars of the
other,- betwixt the grandeur of the Rhine and the sweet-
ness of the Moselle, the scenery is agreeably diversified.
We catch a glimpse of the noble scenery of Nassau, to
which Coblentz officiates as a sort of park lodge, embow-
ered amid evergreens and flower knots; while to the oppo-
site shore, the green hills come sloping down, as if to find
in the Rhine the natural boundary of the plaisant pays
de France.”
As the Prussians then occupied, as victors, the city
which now pays its modest taxes to the Black Eagle as its
true and lawful sovereign, they had of course possession of
the best quarters in the place. I had, however, the luck
to find quiet lodgings in a narrow street almost adjoining
the Benedictine suburb; and still more fortunately, (as a
particularly hot dogstar was raging,) it was on the shady
side of the way."
Lieber Gott! - On what trifles are our destinies

balanced! Had it been on the sunny side, I should never
have had occasion to include the Rhine in these my remi-
niscences; or should have remembered Coblentz only for
the cool rush of its waters, the rustle of its poplars, and
the pure whiteness of the frosted silver from the mines of
the neighbouring Duchy, which it manufactures with such
tasteful adroitness.
But as it was a fierce July, and my sitting-room window
secure from a ray of sunshine, I placed as near to it as
possible the table whereon were deposited my desk and
books, and the easy chair in which I used to enjoy my
meerschaum and my reveries; in order to afford myself
the utmost advantage of the fresh air recommended to
perfect my recovery. There, my arm in a sling, and my
spirits almost equally infirm, I used to sit from morning
till evening twilight; studying the German language in
the pages of Goethe and Kotzebue, till I grew as blue and
sentimental as a Forget-me-not and began to Kant most
abominably.
After having cudgelled my brains sợ successfully with
conjugations and declensions that, without much recourse
to the dictionary, I could make out Wilhelm Meister or
Werther, I began to notice, in the lucid intervals of my
wool-gatherings, that the opposite windows, which were
closed all the morning for the same reason that caused
mine to be left open, namely, the aspect of the house,
were adorned with flowers, the fragrance of which was
distinctly perceptible from my chamber; mignionette,
heliotrope, verbena, geraniums, — besides various plants
less grateful to the smell, but to the eye more beautiful, as
well as to the pocket more costly.
There were five windows ; the ledges of all which,
protected by an old fashioned grillage, were filled with
flowers.
I had every reason to be satisfied with my opposite
neighbours ; for in addition to the sweetness and beauty of
their hanging gardens, there hung in one of the windows
a piping bulfinch, whose performance of one of Mozart's
prettiest waltzes was a constant source of amusement.
After enjoying the sweetness of its song and the helio-

tropes, for a day or two, it suddenly occurred to me, that
birds and flowers afford a pretty strong indication of female
habitation ; and I decided that the handsome solid hotel,
straight into whose face I was compelled to look sixteen
hours of the twenty-four, must contain at least one
charming specimen of the sex, addicted to the poetry of
nature as developed in bulfinches and rose-bushes.
As soon as I had taken this for granted, I became
anxious for the hour when, on the disappearance of the
sun, the blinds were thrown open, and the apartments,
whose cooller morning aspect was towards the court-yard,
became partially disclosed to view. My dinner-time in-
terfered once or twice, I fancy, with the happiness I
ambitioned of discovering by what fair hand the flowers
were watered and the bird-cage supplied with fresh
groundsel. But after three days' watching, I contrived to
jump up from dessert just as the snow-white dress of a
retreating figure was apparent, vanishing from the windows.
That night, I scarcely slept ; so great was my disappoint-
ment at having missed a sight of the charming unknown
intermingled in my dreams with the fragrance of delicious
flowers, and the supernatural music which, to my thinking,
is the very realization of fairy song.
If I died of hunger next day, I was determined not to
quit the window till I had seen the face of the proprietress
of the piping bulfinch! – I was convinced that she must
be beautiful, — I felt that she must be beautiful ;— and it
is a delightful incident, at four-and-twenty, to be the
opposite neighbour of a beautiful woman, who waters her
own mignionette and blows the chaff from the seed trough
of her own bird-cage. Particularly in Germany. Such
situations are made for Germany. I turned over the
leaves of nearly the whole edition of Goethe and Kotzebue,
for a quotation germane to the matter, and found more
than enough to fill half-a-dozen common-place books.
At length, after several days of irritating anxiety, my
wish was accomplished. — And what an accomplishment !
-What an ethereal creature, - what a pure and gracious
being met my view !- Fair, not as daylight, which is not
fair; – but fair as moonlight, - and like moonlight,

serene and touching. – I never saw a skin that so com-
pletely justified the old and hacknied comparison of the
lily; I never saw eyes that so thoroughly exemplified the
s equally worn-out simile of blue as heaven. The beau-
teous vision might be compared rather to one of Ossian's
shadowy heroines than to mere flesh and blood. She was
attired in a floating filmy dress of muslin; and between
its silvery whiteness, the aërial form of the wearer, and
the profusion of flaxen hair accompanying that seraphic
face, I could have persuaded myself, when she vanished
from the window, that I had been gazing on an angel !
- I began to think it strange that the people who had
offered so many vulgar pretexts as an excuse for the
high price of my lodgings, should never have thought of
naming the advantage of living opposite to the Herr Bau-
Berg-und-Weg-Inspector von Schwanenfeldt, and his
beauteous Wilhelmina.
My dear reader is by this time sufficiently familiar -
with me, to know that I am afflicted with no propensity
for falling in love; and that I could have waltzed through
half-a-dozen seasons at Almack's, or played billiards
through an indefinite number of frosts at country houses
in the Christmas holidays, without endangering my own
peace of mind and heart, whatever I might do to those of
other people.
But one cannot always resist the force of situation.
The propinquities of that snug apartment in the Rue du
Montblanc, for instance, and the charm of lodging opposite
the flower-beds of the wife or daughter of a Prussian
Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector, afforded a juxta-position of
the most dangerous nature. I own I felt myself in con-
siderable danger of a fit of the sentimentals.
I fancy there must have been infection in the air ; for
the following day, the flowers were watered a quarter of
an hour earlier than usual, and the bulfinch was allowed
to perch on her finger and chirruped to, with a degree of
innocent tenderness that might have undeviled Mephis-
tophiles. A sweet girlish smile irradiated the heavenliest
of human faces, as she kissed the beak of the happy bird,
previous to replacing it in its cage. Bewitching being !

How I thanked the lucky accident which had directed me
to pause at Coblentz, previous to repairing to the baths of
Ems and Schlangenbad. I even invented a new beatitude
in « Blessed are the wounded at Waterloo, for they may
sit all the day long in bay windows, adoring their opposite
neighbours ! -"
It is twice as pleasant to fall in love in summer-time,
when earth and air seem also inspired by the tender
passion. The birds sing, and the roses blow; and one
does not feel quite so ridiculous when inditing one's first
stanza to the moon.
Blessed moon ! - how grateful was I to its auspicious
brightness, when, at the close of half-a-dozen anxious
days and feverish nights, my eagerness to obtain an un-
constrained view of my lovely neighbour was rewarded by
an hour's unintermitting contemplation of her angelic
countenance, upturned towards the effulgent lamp of night!
- Unconscious that she was watched from behind the
curtain of the opposite window, die Unbegreifliche sat
wrapt in her dressing-gown and pensive meditation beside
her own. The street was narrow, the summer night
tranquil, - not a breath astir. I fancied I could detect
the sighs that heaved her gentle bosom, nay, I could
almost have sworn that I saw a tear glitter in her eyes, as
she gazed on the unsullied brightness of that glorious orb.
But that my right arm was still in a sling, methinks I
should have rushed to my writing-table and hazarded
a rash declaration of the feelings generating like a summer
storm in my overcharged bosom.
But I forbore. Conscience, or prudence, or some other
highly commendable scruple, reminded me that there was
a tenth commandment ; and that the fair being on whose
alabaster forehead the moon was shining so serenely,
while the flowers mingled their ambient odours with her
breath and mine, was not the daughter but the wife of
the worshipful Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector von
Schwanenfeldt. I had no more right to covet that aërial
creature, than the man-servant, or maid-servant, or post-
wagon horse wherewith the Inspector jolted off, evening
after evening, to booze away his hours with the Comman-

dant of the garrison, old general Maximilian Schlachen-
wachenhausen, at his head quarters at Thal.
Wilhelmina was only a few years my junior, yet in
aspect still a child. Something in the secluded domesticity
of the German women seems to secure them from the
touch of time. They are invariably the youngest of their
years of all the daughters of Eve. There was an almost
Scriptural purity in the looks and gestures of the Inspec.
tor's wife. I said to myself that night, after the moonlight
scene, when I had held my breath and Wilhelmina her
peace for two hours by the clock of the Rath Haus, —
Heaven send that this singular adventure end not like the
fatal passion of the Junge Werthers, for his Lottchen. I
began to curse myself for the levity with which, only two
years before, I had allowed myself to jest with Byron over
the Hoffmannisms and weinerlichen Romane recited for us
by Schlegel and Madame de Staël. I had laid un hallowed
hands upon the ark, and atonement might be demanded
of me.
I had taken up my rest at Coblentz for the enjoyment
of its smiling landscape, and the contemplation of the
desolated fortress frowning upon those tranquil waters.
It was for the contemplation of a different object from the
shattered wall
Auf des Berges Felſen-ſtirn erhöht,
that I tarried on. Why should one feel ashamed of
remaining in a place, to look upon the face of an exceeding
fair woman, any more than to admire Mont Blanc, or
Vesuvius, or the Rheingau, or any other surpassing work
of nature ? —
I hazarded no attempt to present myself to the acquaint-
ance of the lovely Wilhelmina. I was content to breathe
the same air with her, to inhale the fragrance of the same
flowers, to worship the brightness of the same delicious
planet. My heart was too withered with its sorrows to
aspire to a dream of greater happiness. — I had no right
to refresh my blighted feelings, blighted by affliction,
blighted by remorse, in the dews of a spirit so young, so
pure, so heavenly, as that of the gentle one whose happi-

ness was now as innocent as that of our hapless foremother
in Paradise.
I could not but flatter myself, that the peculiar nature
of my sympathy had not wholly escaped her notice. She
could not but have noticed me transfixed beside the open
window, hour after hour, day after day; with my eyes
riveted upon her own, as a Persian gazes on the sun, or
as Leander may have watched the light emanating from the
torch of Sestos' daughter. For she lingered longer and
longer with her bird and flowers. I almost fancied tears
of sensibility trembling in her large blue eyes, as she bent
them towards my window, whenever, in the wantonness of
vanity, I delayed to make my appearance simultaneously
with her own.
Though I still swore to myself almost on affidavit to
respect the virtuous home of the Herr von Schwanenfeldt,
there was nothing to forbid my enjoying the visionary
pleasure of lending a soul to that beauteous form, - of
supposing all that was passing in that gentle bosom, -
of dwelling upon the perfections manifested to me as those
of some heavenly visitant to the sons of clay. I might,
at least, permit myself to dream of Wilhelmina. —And
dream of her I did, till my sleep was happier than my
hours of waking adoration.
One day, as I sat musing beside my window with a
volume of Schiller in my hand, I suddenly descried, -oh,
joy!- oh, triumph !- the door of the bird-cage slightly
ajar !--- I do not mean to reflect upon any one. - Heaven
forbid I should insinuate that Wilhelmina had any share
in such inadvertency. But I say again, that the door of
the cage was slightly ajar. If the little flutterer would but
take advantage of this negligence to pay me a visit !- On
this hint of my ardent imagination, I instantly began to
chirrup in a tone as nearly similar to that I had heard
emitted by Frau von Schwanenfeldt, as was in the power
of my manly voice. I saw Master Bully duck his little
black poll, and wink his cunning little eyes, as if medita-
ting a flight. I chirruped again ;- he sidled on his
perch. I chirruped again ; – he hopped down. I chir-
ruped again ;- he reached the threshold of the cage door.

Again !- he lighted on the bough of an hibiscus, — then
on the window-ledge. Again !- and, lo! he flitted across
the street and lighted on my own ! —
Magna Dii curant, parva negligunt.
I could scarcely breathe ;— the slightest movement and
the little startled truant might make his way back again,
and defeat my projects. Again I chirruped invitingly,
though preserving the most rigid, the almost unearthly
immobility; and this time, Bully piped up his waltz,
as if to acknowledge the commencement of our visiting
acquaintance.
From the days of the Fox and the Crow, this species
of vanity has been fatal to the perpetrator. He was
taking too much pains with his song to perceive the
Bandana I flung over him, till fairly taken in the toil
of its silken folds. I was not bound to know whose bird
it was ; and, having possessed myself of a Berlin basket
that stood by way of ornament on one of the consoles,
incarcerated the little anonymous runaway, till further
notice.
That day, instead of waiting at the window the moment
when the gradual retreat of the evening sun enabled the
major domo of the Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector
von Schwanenfeldt to open the blinds of his master's state
apartments, and the Frau Bau-Berg-und Weg-Inspectorinn
to sprinkle her heliotropes and mignionette, I kept quietly
in the back-ground ;- my ear on the alert to catch the
first exclamation of horror, proclaiming her discovery of
the departure of her faithless favourite.
Exclamation of horror ? —Ah! Wilhelmina ! I swear
her shriek might have brought down the tottering remnants
of the shattered wall of Ehrenbreitstein !- Instead of a faint
scream, this fragile sylph-like being exhibited the impas-
sioned energy of Siddons, when, as Elvira, she struck
terror into the brazen soul of Pizarro, impersonated by
that man of mettle, Blue Beard Barrymore. I was
paralyzed !- I trembled to think on what I had done. -
Bully, in his basket, doubtless trembled too!

that vier Stronthaler would be given in reward to whosoever
should bring to the residence of the Excellent Bau-Berg-und
Weg-Inspector von Schwanenfeldt, a bulfinch, answering
to the name of “ Schatzchen,” and no questions asked.
This did not exactly suit my views. My object was
to be asked questions. By and by, came the town printer,
with a copy of the Steck-brief that was to come flying all
abroad and make the walls of Coblentz eloquent with the
loss of “ Schatzchen.”
I seriously recommend novices in the prigging line to
be cautious of entrapping a piping bulfinch. You may
leave a watch unwound, so that its ticking betray you
not; a pocket-handkerchief has not a word to say for
itself. But the fright I was in, lest that infernal waltz
of Bully's should prematurely pipe up, is beyond descrip-
tion. I was afraid of closing the windows, lest so
unusual a movement in July might beget suspicion. I
was still more apprehensive of closing the basket too
hermetically, lest I should stifle suspicion and the bulfinch
together ; being desirous that Schatzchen should pipe in
the land of the living, at least till the post-wagon carried
off the Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector to Thal. It
was then I purposed to deposit my hidden treasure once
more in the possession of its beloved and loving mistress.
There must be something peculiarly emollient in the
atmosphere of Germany. Here was I, Cis Danby,
blackened by the smoke of Waterloo, after years of pre-
vious defacement by the smoke of London, grown tender
as a pheasant poult, — maidenly as a snowdrop, — simple
as a cowslip, — and about to make my débớt with a
flaxen-haired divinity in white muslin, with a piping bul-
finch on my finger ! — I would not have had Watier's
catch sight of me at that moment, for the rent-roll of Or-
mington Hall.
Thut nichts ! — As soon as dusk and the post-wagon
arrived, (but the post-wagon arrived first, for a July twi-
light is eternal as the youth of the lovely matrons of Teu-
tonia,) I arrayed myself as though I had just stepped out
of the pages of one of Auguste la Fontaine's novels, or
Kotzebue's comedies, -- dishevelled my hair, and inserted

my wounded arm into a sling as black as midnight ; —
then, after a glance or two at the mirror, and a glance or
two at Schatzchen, who was beginning to cower pensively
in a corner of his basket as if grievously in want of hemp-
seed or Wilhelmina,—tottered down stairs leaning on the
arm of O'Brien my valet; — rang at the bell of the In-
spector's mansion, — and requested an audience of the
Frau Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspectorinn Wilhelmina von
Schwanenfeldt.
If there exist in this nether sphere the slightest hint of
those sympathies which I had recently read of in the pages
of Goethe and Wieland, as familiarly as though disem-
bodied spirits were as common as town-criers or Prussian
sergeants in the imaginative country wherein I was a
sojourner; if, I say, there exist such spiritual influences
in these our times, of a certainty the lights must have
burned blue at that moment in the chamber where the
worshipful Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector von
Schwanenfeldt was engaged in a game of dominos with the
redoubtable General Maximilian von Schlachenwachen-
hausen, knight of the second class of the Black Eagle.
I never knew what sensibility was till I witnessed the
meeting between Wilhelmina and her bulfinch ! - Fami.
liarized from my infancy with the passion of Lady Or-
mington for lap-dogs, I had looked upon such penchants
as the bran, or sawdust, or shavings, or any other soft
material, filling up the interstices between harder and
larger objects commingled in the great packing-case of life.
But I had not conjectured the intensity of love that might
exist between five feet six of human nature, and a feathered
favourite to whom a patch-box would serve for coffin ! —
Yet I swear the attachment was as mutual as it was mar-
vellous. — I doubt whether an affection half so true ever
existed between five feet six of heroine, and six feet
nothing of hero. Scarcely had I opened the basket in
Wilhelmina's presence, when the bird roused itself as by
enchantment, — shook its plumes, — noddled its jetty
crest, — and at the merest accent of her accustomed chirp,
flew to her finger, trying by a thousand little cries and
flutterings to render her sensible of its joy in seeing her

again, and its shame at having been decoyed from her
protection ! — Kisses, --- real kisses, were interchanged
between them; and when, at length, Bully attempted a
slight carol of his waltz, tears fell from the large blue
eyes of his lovely mistress, like summer rain from the
azure skies of June.
I leave it to a reader of even moderate humanity to
conceive my sensations when, approaching me in a pa-
roxysm of bewilderment, she seized my hand and pressed
it fervently between her own. Wild with the joy of
receiving her lost treasure, the Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-
Inspector's wife knew not how to express with sufficient
fervency the excess of her gratitude.
What a woman !- what a gem of sensibility !- What
treasures must exist undeveloped in that gentle bosom !
Such hei !- If a bulfinch could thus excite the fervour
of her emotions, what would be her tenderness, what her
truth, what her elegant elevation of soul, when roused by the
influence of a sympathetic passion! I would not, I could
not bring myself to believe that the Herr Bau-Berg-und-
Weg-Inspector von Schwanenfeldt had touched the chord
of her finer sentiments !– He was a hard, square, bony,
rectangular man, highly respected by his tribunal and his
tobacconist, but making too much use of his nose both to
talk through and feed with rappee, to render him a fitting
partner in life for a fleecy cloud, inspired by a soul so
finely organized as to expand into ecstacies at the song of
a bulfinch. — I had, in short, very little doubt of finding
a second femme incomprise.
After Schatzchen had been reinstated in his cage, with
fresh groundsel, sugar, seed, and sand, à discrétion, on
a much higher system of philosophy than causes the
pedagogue to brandish his birch over a returned truant, it
followed of course that as four rix dollars could not be
proposed as my recompense, I must be civilly entreated.
So as Wilhelmina could offer me nothing else, she offered
me a seat.
Her bosom still heaved with emotion, and tears glittered
in her large blue eyes, like dew upon a gentian. The
moment seemed propitious for the avowal of my long and

ardent desire to make the acquaintance of my charming
opposite neighbour ; and I accordingly commenced a re-
capitulation of certain phrases indispensable to the occa-
sion, - Siegwartig-isms which I retained as part of the
shibboleth of Madame la Comtesse Anacharsis de la
Vrillière, I beg her pardon — of Thérèse! — I flatter
myself that my enunciation was perlé as that of Made-
moiselle Mars, and my delivery such as Fleury or the
Chaussée d’Antin might have approved ; but I was careful
not to mount at once too high into the clouds, remember.
ing that “ Chi troppo sassotiglia si scavezza."
Never shall I forget my disappointment at the blank
look of wonder accompanying Madame von Schwanenfeldt's
avowal of comprehending neither my French nor my
explanations.
I was beginning to read German indifferently well; but
to ask for my breakfast, was the utmost I could accom-
plish. As to clothing fine sentiments in appropriate lan-
guage, I might as well have attempted to dress a wax doll
in the wrap-rascal of a Connaught cadger. I had nothing
that would fit the occasion. My best German was worthy
only to order an omelette for myself or corn for my horse.
I should barely have known how to pronounce
Empfüll davon dein Herz,
or any other bit of tender eloquence.
Gott ſteh' mir bei ! - What the deuce was to be-
come of me! Was I to find my way to the affections
of Wilhelmina by piping a waltz, like Schatzchen ? —
for sighing and looking, sighing and looking, might do
very well for Philip's warlike son, under the influence of
a bottle and a half of Cyprus wine; but would scarcely
serve the turn of Cecil Danby, dieted on chicken panada.
Though incapable of talking, I was not incompetent to
listen ; and listen I did, with exquisite delight, to the
expressions of exaggerated joy and gratitude poured forth
by Wilhelmina, bright and sparkling as the waters of
Selters leaping from their rock. She tried to impress
upon my mind by the united force of diction and panto-
mime, her agony at the first discovery of the cage-door

269
being open and the bird departed ; - her hopes that it
might still return to one who loved it so dearly ; - her
fears lest it should have fallen into the hands of cold or
careless persons ;- and all this was uttered so fluently,
yet so energetically, with so much aid from sighs and
tears, eyes uplifted to Heaven, and white hands clasped
with impassioned fervour, that I felt as if a page of the
choicest poetry were unfolded for my delight. My soul
was kindled to enthusiasm by the bright rays of inspiration
emitted by the countenance of that celestial creature.
At last, came the moment for leave-taking. I had
delivered myself of my errand ; and was as destitute of
means of allusion to heliotropes or moonbeams, as if just
landed from the Sandwich islands. All I could do was
to heave an enormous sigh ; place my right hand em-
phatically on that portion of the left side supposed to
be consecrated to the tender affections, — look as cruelly
charming as I could, — and go about my business; all
which I executed with proper emphasis and discretion.
I do not think even the drowsiest of Kotzebue's comedies
would have secured me a night's rest, that night. -- I
tossed and turned on my pillow as restlessly as the narrow
dimensions of a German bed would admit; and thought
myself greatly to be pitied for rising with as severe a
headach the following morning, as if I had swallowed
a flask of Kirschwasser at the Herr von Schwanenfeldt's
instead of deep draughts of that Elysian nectar, which
converts men and women into divinities, just as of old
it brought down gods and goddesses from their high
Olympus !
Now that I am stricken in years, I can appreciate the
ecstacy of a restless night of that description ; a sort of
delirious imbroglio of flowers, moonlight, perfumes, blue
eyes, pearly teeth, lily hands, bulfinches, Goethe, the devil
and Dr. Faustus. Now that not even the paradise of
Mahomet in perspective would keep open my eyes after
my whist and supper at Crockey's, methinks one hour
of boyish infatuation were worth whole ages of my present
grovelling materialism.
A worse infliction than the headach, however, awaited me

on the morrow of that fantastic night. O'Brien my valet
de chambre made his appearance with much such a
sinile as he used to wear some years before as Tim my
tiger, when undrawing the convolvulus curtains on especial
occasions. The boy was father to the man, — the tiger to
the valet ; -and his eyes were twinkling with inward
laughter as he laid a billet of considerable promise on my
rumpled pillow. Could not one swear to the letter of a
pretty woman by shape and scent, as one does to those
which have passed through quarantine ? —
Need I say that I tore 'it open as became the petulance
of Cecil Danby !-- Perhaps I need not even add, to a
public so intelligent as that I am addressing, that not one
syllable it contained could I make out! Written German
was more incomprehensible to me than German spoken;
and Wilhelmina's billet looked something between one of
my Greek exercises and the hieroglyphics of a doctor's
prescription. What it prescribed to me, I knew no more
than William the Conqueror !-.
What was to be done ? — It was a dreadful exigency !
The servant waited for an answer. To call up my landlord
and consult him about the contents of a billet from the
Frau Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspectorinn was out of the
question. Promising to send an answer, therefore, I sent
for a carriage and made the best of my way to my
librarian's ; with whom abided an intelligent young French-
man, to whom I had already had recourse in several
dilemmas; and to him, tearing off the signature at the
bottom, and with a face blushing celestial rosy red, as
mine had seldom blushed since Eton, I exhibited my billet-
doux. Like Pharaoh, I requested an interpretation.
“I congratulate you, sir !” – said he, in a tone that
left me little doubt of my great good fortune. “Consider-
ing the briefness of your sojourn in this city, you have
achieved more than many of my countrymen who have re-
sided ten years at Coblentz !”
I trust he did not perceive the self-complacent air with
which I ran my eye along my own graceful outline, till it
rested on the point of my boot.
“ You are invited,” he continued, “ to dinner to-day

at two o'clock, by one of the most respectable magistrates
of the city; the Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector von
Schwanenfeldt, who resides in _”
« Yes, yes, I know !” — cried I, interrupting him.
“I was aware that it was an invitation to dinner ; but
could not exactly make out the hour. - At two, you
say?”–
" At two, the usual dinner-hour in Germany. You
will find charming people, sir, in Monsieur de Schwanen-
feldt and his wife. The lady is one of the loveliest women
in the Rhenish provinces,—d'une réputation intacte, though
exceedingly admired.”
Again, I might have interrupted him with “ I know,
I know.” But I preferred asking for the last edition of
Jean Paul, by way of pretext for my intrusion; and
hurried home to answer the invitation by polite verbal
acceptance.
I was about to behold her then ! — to behold her sur-
rounded with the duties and joys of her innocent life; -
not only with the bulfinch and the heliotropes, but with
husband and children ! - Alas! alas ! - I could scarcely
bear to connect the idea of Wilhelmina with the model
magistrate of Coblentz!
I did not much better fancy the idea of dining at two
o'clock, or rather of going out to dinner at two o'clock.
How was I to make myself irresistible in the broiling
middle of a July day? — There was nothing for it, of
course, but boots and half dress. I must trust to nature
to accomplish her own miracles. Schatzchen would be
there to plead for me; if indeed there needed any other
voice with Wilhelmina, than that of her gentle heart.
It required some courage to confront the Herr Bau-
Berg-und-Weg-Inspector and his Teutonic croaking. But
had I surmised that, intead of German, he would accost
me in Germanized French, such as would have convulsed
any audience of the Boulevart with laughter if delivered
by Brunet or Potier, I should scarcely have found courage
to attempt my self-introduction to the solemn middle-aged
gentleman who, with the pedantic solemnity of a retired

schoolmaster, thanked me for having - rabborté lé bétit
why so, te Matame zon ébouze.”
Wilhelmina was charming, and attired as angels ought
to be dressed on gala days: i. e. in a clean white muslin
dress, with a sash of dark-coloured riband that displayed
to admiration the turn of her delicate waist. — No orna-
ments ; — nothing but a single rose, fresh from the garden,
which looked as if it had caught among her ringlets, as
she made her way through the entangled branches of a
shrubbery.— I could have indited quires of hexameters to
that happy rose ! -
Conceiving that it may be as disagreeable to my reader
to peruse, as it was to me to listen, to the “ bladidudes” of
the Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector, I shall briefly
state that he was not much more boring and disagreeable,
- nor much more of a Schlaf-mutze — than privileged by
matrimonial patent; and that we sat down with a dog-day
sun flaming into the room, to a dinner that smelt very
much like the quarters of the Royal Irish, when cam-
paigning among the renowned onion fields of Portugal.
Our soup consisted of snippings of cabbage served in the
water in which they were boiled, with little suet dumplings
floating on the top ; our fish was a cold pike, with vinegar
sauce garnished with rings of onions. To these, (washed
down by a gargle of Rhenish ordinaire, which, like the
famous Nauemburger, served to indicate where vinegar
grows wild,) succeeded a dish of exceedingly fat bouilli,
accompanied, Germanwise, by four sauce-boats, containing
pickled cherries, a purée of onions, another of meer-rettig,
and a black nameless compound that looked and smelt
marvellously like senna-tea.
My nerves were somewhat shaken on perceiving with
what heroic fortitude Wilhelmina not only divided her
fish with her knife, but afterwards, immersing the clumsy
blade in the vinegar so as to blacken the surface, insinuated
it fearlessly into her mouth! For a moment, I was
apprehensive of the worst consequences. But as she sur-
vived it, so did I. Of the fat bouilli and senna-sauce, she
ate with voracity; and when the third dish was placed on

table, consisting of a stew of wild boar swimming in
stewed apricots, and looking like everything that was
nastiest in nature, I literally shuddered at the unctuosity
of lip with which this etherial being justified her carni-
vorous propensities.
Next came an eierspeise, which she imbibed with equal
satisfaction, accompanied by an ill-roasted joint of veal,
well basted with butter; and two or three-soup plates of
leguminous compound, that looked as if ladled out of a
weedy ditch. Then wafers, then salad, — then leveret,
that must have forgotten the date of its killing ; — then
cheese, that must have forgotten the date of its pressing ;
- then fruit, then zucker-brod, — then sugar-plums, -
then coffee, — then kirsch; to say nothing of half-a-dozen
hors-d'ouvres, such as pickled herring, Brunswick sausage,
slices of raw ham, pumpernickel, caviar, and other creature-
comforts of equal delicacy.
Gott in Himmel ! - to see the idol of one's soul fill
the lips that Leonardo would have delighted to paint, —
lips like the half-open bud of a Boursault rose, - lips that
seemed formed only to emit a murmur of tenderness and
joy, — the plaint of Margaret, — the song of Thekla, - to
see those lips dilate to receive a vile, circumferential slice
of Braunsweiger Bratwurst. — Oh! Tommy Moore, -
oh! Johannes Secundus, - oh! Lord Strangford ! - oh!
Camoens ! — oh, everybody else who has ever versified
upon those ruby portals of the Temple of Beauty, - feel
for me!- Es rührt mich der Schlag auf der Stelle !
The horror of the Arabian husband who beheld his
wife Amina steal to the churchyard and indulge in her
foul repast of human flesh, could not have exceeded mine.
I should as soon have expected the Venus de Medicis or
Belvidere Apollo to sup on cheese and onions, as that
etherial creature. My only consolation was the belief that
this sylph, this Undine, this fay, this sprite, might perhaps
be trifling with my sensibilities, and trying the force of
my attachment by the perpetration of enormities.
We repaired together to the drawing-room; the per-
siennes of which were closed to exclude the afternoon sun,
so that I had no pretext for alluding to the flowers.—The

flowers, nevertheless, would have been a most agreeable
accessory; for the Herr Inspector entered the room with
a flavour of second-rate tobacco reeking from his garments,
which might have been advantageously dispensed with.
But though my faith in Madame von Schwanenfeldt's
divinity was somewhat staggered by a prodigious plate of
sauer-kraut, which I saw her devour at dinner as though
it were ambrosia, she looked so lovely, there was such a
glance of deprecation in those heavenly eyes, even when
eating sauer-kraut, that I began to revile myself for my
want of amplitude of soul, that could make no allowance
for national customs, or the force of early habit ; more
particularly when, on Schatzchen's striking up his ac-
customed song, Madame von Schwanenfeldt turned towards
me with a smile of tender intelligence that might have
“ woke a soul under the ribs of death,” or the rock of
Ehrenbreitstein.
The Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector, a little boozy
with wine and tobacco, perceiving that I made no move-
ment to take my leave, proposed that, later in the day,
when the sun becarne less fervid, we should proceed
together to a garden of Eden, on the Nassau road, (which
after-experience proved to be some abominable tea-gardens,
sacred to the Scheibene Schiessen,) and that in the mean-
time Wilhelmina should favour us with some music,
Music executed by the object of our affections, has
always struck me as the acme of human felicity, — “ the
food of love,” as well as its glorious emanation. To listen
to some chef-d'æuvre of Mozart or Cimarosa, or even
some touching romance from the lips of Wilhelmina, would,
I felt, transport me above this visible diurnal sphere. In
London the Demoiselles de Lihu, and in Paris, Thérèse,
had attuned my ear to all the elegance of this captivating
species of composition, — the dragée of the musical feast.
After the much-approved fashion of performers and inn-
keepers, of asking you what you will please to have,
though pre-determined to inflict the pig and pruin sauce
which your soul abhorreth, Wilhelmina, on seating herself
at the piano, inquired what she should give me! where-
upon I ventured to propose, “Non so più cosa son,”-

“ Voi che sapete," — or some other of the accomplishable
master-pieces of Mozart. When lo ! to my utter horror,
die Unbegreifliche suddenly burst into a crashing, thun-
dering sonata, of the high-pressure instrumental school
just then, for the curse of pianofortes and society, beginning
to bring heaven and earth and the two extremities of the
instrument together! -
Wilhelmina's piano was execrable, to an ear accustomed
to the full-bodied tones of Broadwood and Kirkman ; and
she had not skirmished up and down the keys five minutes,
before my nerves were demi-semi-quavered and chro-
maticized into a state of anguish. — I felt as if I had
swallowed a glass of vitriol. —
Not so the Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector ! -
Exalted to the seventh heaven by this astounding rattling
of keys and chaotic confusion of sharps, flats, and naturals,
he saw fit not to beat, but to stamp time to the music till
the flooring seemed giving way under the horrible iteration
of his blows. The measured tramp of the commendatore's
ghost in Don Giovanni, is not half so appalling.
I felt myself in considerable danger of committing
Inspectoricide. My evil spirit was roused by all this
banging: -
Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
Nigræ feraci frondis in Algido,
Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso,
Ducit opes animumque ferro.
I do not affect to be an amiable man.--I know myself.-
As Byron sings, -
I had been ill brought up, and was born bilious ;
and beg my readers to take into consideration that the
thermometer was at 84°, my frame undergoing the diges-
tive process of dumpling soup, raw veal, and divers other
equally hard matters ; - the room full of buzzing flies, --
my head of the fumes of Asmannhausen ; when I admit
that I felt fully capable of the manslaughter of the Herr
Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector who was so hospitably enter-
taining me. But for Wilhelmina's azure eyes and floating
ringlets, methinks I could have found it in my soul to
include her in the massacre !--

Before the close of the stormy sonata, however, Schwan-
enfeldt was called away mysteriously to a client; where-
upon, after receiving my thanks for the extraordinary
exertions she had made in my favour, Wilhelmina quitted
the piano, evidently satisfied that she had accomplished
a miracle.
Having gazed earnestly and circumstantially round the
room, to ascertain that the thumper who had kept time
for her elaborate performance, had no longer any time at
her disposal, she seated herself on a sofa near the window,
which I bad often seen her occupy, and with smiling
serenity took out her work.
I trust the reader does me the justice to conclude that
I assumed a place by her side.

GOETHE.
My poetry is the dream of the sleeping passions. When they are awake,
I cannot speak their language - only in their somnambulism.
BYRON.
DEAR reader!- wert thou ever in Germany? I do not
mean, didst thou ever steamboat it up or down the Rhine,
or swallow the natural physic of the waters of Baden or
Aix-la-Chapelle ; — for who hath not? — I mean, didst
(thou ever abide in the soft bosom of a recht herzliche Ger-
man family, — drink of their beer, — smoke of their to-
bacco, — and chaw metaphysics with them ; – the extra-
ordinary exaltation of their minds justifying itself to yours
by anxiety to lose sight of degradation of body, so prepos-
terously gross and nasty. By Jupiter ! if the spitting-box
and beer-bottle do not incline a man to refine with hair-
breadth casuistry upon some psychological theory capable
of propelling the soul into the clouds at the rate of the
Nassau-balloon, the devil himself would not make a meta-
physician of him!
But I say again, dear reader, wert thou ever in cordial,
kind-hearted, boozy, foozy, Deutschland ? — Stennst du
das Land; not where the Citronen bluhn; but where the
lindens shed their summer bloom ? — where the round-
polled acacia, like a green mop, or a sham orange-tree,
adorns the beer-garden ?- where weeping-willows, hanging
over a pond enlivened by fancy ducks, wring poesy out of

the soul of the pale student? — where learning hath run
herself to earth, — where poetry hovereth in the air, —
where the drama, as the Transcendental School would say,
“ kindleth eternally her terrible energies, like the Destinies
spinning a thread of asbestos ; — where classical lore hath
found an inner temple, in which the law to lay down -
the divinities re-enshrining, wherewith he hath run away
charged, like some old Corinthian, from the sack of his
city, with his household gods upon his back, — and where
all that is coarse, uncivilised, and matter-of-fact in human
existence, with all that is heroic, sublime, creative, soul-
refining, purpose-exalting, hope-exciting, for evermore
united is?”
If not, trust me thou art incapable of appreciating -
guess what? — I give it thee in ten - I give it thee in
twenty — as Madame de Sévigné wrote to her daughter.
It is neither Goethe, Jean Paul, Beethoven, the Sonnets
or Glyptotheca of Ludwig I., nor the policy of Metternich,
nor the mysteries of the Burschenschaft, — nor any other
of the grand or glorious incomprehensibilities that “ with
the moral hieroglyphics of the land of spiritual influences
interwoven or co-existent are.” If not, I say — for thou
art so slow of surmise that I must fain disclose my mystery
- if not, thou canst little appreciate the influence of the
knitting-needle, in the history of domestic life!
A casual observer might spend six months in Germany,
particularly in Rhenish Germany, and carry away an im-
pression that the men were never without pipes in their
mouths, or the women without knitting-needles in their
hands. I once saw the body of a drowned woman taken
out of the Rhine, round which five anxious individuals
were clustered, labouring to minister to its resuscitation.
Not one of them dreamed of removing his pipe from his
mouth, while the work of life and death was proceeding
under his hands. Nay, 1 once saw a fair Tedescan ex-
posed to the soliciting of a lover, eloquent as Mephisto-
pheles, impassioned as St. Preux, tender as Romeo, enter-
prising as Lovelace, and handsome as Antonin de Noailles,
who proceeded the while with her lambswool-stocking as
industriously as the witch of the Caucasus !

I do not say who it was; the name of the parties is
nothing to the purpose; but she plied those two long,
black, whalebone knitting-needles as if the fate of the uni-
verse hung upon her stitches !
But lest any unkind person — and the world to which
I write is as bitter as Rochefoucault's maxims or the elder
daughters of Lear — should ascribe the imperturbability
of the heroine to lack of merit in the hero, I beg to add,
that I have seen in the Hof Theater of Vienna (the cen-
tral heart of German civilisation) a gentle creature weep
Danubes of tears over the sorrows of Thekla, or the woes of
Amalia ; then, almost ere the curtain fell, certainly before
the bodies were cleared from the stage, quietly re-assume
her confounded knitting-needles, as though they contained
balm for her wounded feelings!
As to me, I swear that if Cleopatra had invited me to
sail with her on the Cydnus, and under her purple canopy
chosen to amuse herself with knitting, even though the
stocking or brace were destined to Cecil Danby in lieu of
Mark Antony, I should have dropped asleep while watch-
ing the hitching of her fair hands and jerking of her
elbows.
By all this, my public will be induced to conjecture that
I had some difficulty in keeping my eyes open under the
influence of the evening sun, the buzzing flies, the two
o'clock dinner, the Rhenish wine, and the detestable stitchery
upon which the blue eyes of Wilhelmina von Schwanenfeldt
were riveted, while I tried to make it intelligible to her that
the individual seated by her side on the sofa, and usually
divided from her by the width of a street, was nearer akin
to her in all the brighter sensibilities of the soul than the
stamping Herr Bau-Berg-und-Weg-Inspector, or any other
native of the land which wrote Werter, and luxuriates in
sausages and small beer.
I poured out my soul in a happy mixture of French,
English, German, Latin, and gibberish; and as she had
sufficiently comprehended the same when I tried to make
her understand that I did not eat apricot-sauce with my
foie gras, I thought she might prove equally intelligent
when I talked about the stars and the flowers — Schatz-

chen — heliotropiums — kindred souls - the music of the
spheres -- the immortality of love — and all the other little
nothings-at-all with which the Cupids of the banks of the
Rhine tip their arrows, as Camdeo, on those of the Ganges
tippeth his with bees.
At every fresh outbreak of sentiment, Wilhelmina gently
raised her eyes from her knitting, and fixed them upon
me — large, dilated, and blue as one of Wedgewood's
saucers — then letting them fall again upon her quilt, like
a wax doll at the instigation of the wire wherewith its little
lady silently governs its glassy eyes.
The imagination is a shocking gad-about — the “ folle
de la maison.”—There are moments when, like Ariel, she
puts a girdle round about the earth; and there are others
when, on the contrary, she causeth the said earth to whiz
round like a knife-grinder's wheel. When she chooses,
she can make eleven thousand angels dance on the point of
a needle; or concentrate all the events of a life, all the
heroisms of an Alexander or a Wellington, into the mil-
lionth part of a second. But I question whether the powers
of the Imagination were ever more put to the test than by
myself, when supplying an interpretation to those silent
looks of Wilhelmina !
Every time the Unbegreifliche raised her heavenly eyes,
I strove to read her thoughts in their azure heaven. Like
an astrologer, star-struck and bewildered, I sent forth my
soul, as it were, in quest of hers; and at moments fancied
I had overtaken the bright fugitive, and was intermingling
my thoughts with its aspirings. I grew more and more
eloquent — more and more impassioned. I began to feel
that I was making an impression — I had got the ear of
the house - I warmed with my subject and my situation
- I grew emphatic as Clavigo - my very German flowed
clearer, nearly as intelligible as Lady — 's English. It
was impossible that even the serenest of knitters could
stand it long.
I saw that I was reaching a crisis. Provided the tri-
bunal, or particular business, or particular friend, or small
account which had carried off the Herr Bau-Berg-und-
Weg-Inspector, detained him half an hour longer, I felt

persuaded that my next visit to the garden of Eden on the
Nassau road would be paid tête-à-tête, and on the express
proposition of the gentle creature, still a world of affection
in my debt, for having stolen Schatzchen in order to bring
it back again, endangering my precious neck and precious
soul as a purloiner of piping bulfinches.
I fixed my eyes graspingly upon her heavenly face. —
She grew restless — her colour came and went -- the knit-
ting seemed a moment to vibrate in her hands. I was
about to imprison them within my own (which would have
been easy enough, for I was sitting much closer to her
than etiquette could justify), when, lo!- suddenly fling-
ing down the knitting-needle contained in her left hand,
she placed it before her mouth; and within an inch of my
beating heart executed a sonorous expectoration, as loud as
the report of a culverin. The product she deposited at
my feet!
Und damit holla! - Let us draw a veil over the
crimes of Beauty! — The sequel of this accursed climax
of my disenchantment would be described by a dramatist
in three words, appended to the part of Cecil Danby -
“ Exit in distraction.” I trust my public is too indignant
and disgusted to wish for more. I should, in fact, have
passed over Coblentz in solemn silence, but for the consci.
ousness that, every summer, an enormous proportion of the
academic youth of the three kingdoms enjoys its vacation
between Rotterdam and Strasburg, in danger of being
deluded into bad English and bad logic by the study of
the turgid bombast of modern Almaine; and still greater,
of falling into adventures with blue-saucer-eyed heroines,
who exchange kisses at the window with a favourite bird,
and roses and forget-me-nots by moonlight with a favourite
swain.
Such a conclusion to such a love-passage as mine would,
I am convinced, drive the ethereal spirit of Love as effi-
ciently from their bosoms, as fumigation and bad Latin
ever exorcised Sathanas from a man possessed; and to avoid
such a disruption of the soul (for Love once forcibly ex-
pelled from the breast of youth, leaves, like the gigantic
ghost which expanded from the Castle of Otranto, the

whole structure in ruins), I am in conscience bound to
admit that, not choosing to be spat upon like a Jewish
gaberdine, I ordered post-horses that night, and took myself
off into Switzerland the following morning.
The land of the mountain and flood was indispensable
to re-romanticise my spirit to the pitch from which it had
been precipitated by — ; but enough of her!- I will
not defile my golden Bramah by writing her name again!
If a spark of latent poetry exist within the breast of
man or woman, it must be called forth by collision with
the rocks and stones wherein, instead of finding sermons,
Byron found his third canto of Childe Harold, and I re-
generation after being Wilhelminefied. Torrents and
precipices — the lonely lake — the silent glacier — en-
chanted my soul, so soon as my health enabled me to share
the allotted pains and pleasures of the tourist ; and
finally, I took up my quarters at Vevay, resolved for one
short winter to see what I could make out of the society
of a man universally cited as the pleasantest in London
and Paris, but with whom, at present, I kept up a very
slight acquaintance to wit, the Honourable Cecil Danby.
The spring found me still loitering near the lovely shores
of Lake Leman, still spell-bound at Clarens,
Sweet Clarens, birth-place of deep love !
It was to join me at Geneva that, the following year,
Byron betook himself in the same direction. One of the
wicked wits of the wickedest and wittiest of times has
said that “ there is something in the misfortunes of our
dearest friends not altogether displeasing to us." I trust
there was nothing in the mortifications which just then
overtook poor Byron, from which I was capable of ex-
tracting comfort. But if they did not afford me pleasure,
I own they excited my amazement !- I had left him the
spoiled child of London — the poet and lion of the day
- the bridegroom of an heiress, who was also a beauty
and a bel esprit—and the idol of the whole residue of her
sex. He rejoined me, at the close of little more than a
year's separation, a pariah, a banished man, a monster re-
jected by the caprices of Great Britain !. In his case, the

a
re-action was as sudden as absurd. So extraordinary a
man as my noble friend could not expect to be treated in
an ordinary manner. But the pit and gallery of society,
- the : vulgar groundlings — had exceeded permission in
flinging rotten apples in the face of their favourite actor!
Lord Byron afforded one among a thousand proofs that
the most fatal charge you can make against a man is an
indefinite one. It might be very inconvenient to Jupiter
to embrace a cloud, but it is quite as unsatisfactory to
have to fight one. People looked unutterable things when
they alluded to the sufferings of Lady Byron. A horrid
mystery overhung the separation of the unhappy couple ;
and such of the survivors of that period as remember
the ostracism of one of the finest fellows breathing, will
scarcely recal to mind without indignation, that the put-
ting asunder of those whom God had joined is now ad-
mitted to have arisen from the mere estrangement so often
engendered by pecuniary embarrassments!
To Byron himself, such a result of his duns and bailiffs
seemed so utterly incredible, that he could not believe him-
self to labour under the stigma of having married an
heiress to pay his debts, and maltreated her as a punish-
ment for their non-payment; but seemed to fancy he
must have attempted assassination in his sleep, or com-
mitted forgery without knowing it. It is some comfort to
those who cherish his memory, that “ the late remorse of
love,” though late, has not been wanting.
The two men of my times to whom alone I concede the
title of sublime, Napoleon and Byron, were both deserted
by their wives ! It is a fault for which, I fear, them-
selves must stand accountant. Both were men who would
have been good, had they not chosen to be great. But the
thirst of distinction, if indulged to excess, becomes fiendish
as the thirst for blood. The defence of Napoleon's kindly
nature, so warmly appreciated by all who approached him
neariy, I leave to the eloquence of his biographers. On
that of Byron, which manifested itself without remission
towards me and my distresses, I must be permitted to ex-
patiate.
I do not pretend that in many things he may not have

proved mean, selfish, savage ; but I know, that of all
my acquaintance there is not one who, if reared by such
a mother, rejected by such a wife, and coaxed into egotism
by the flatteries of such a host of toadies, would not have
come forth from the furnace fifty times as hard, as hot,
and deteriorated with fifty times as much alloy, as he with
whom I spent so many hours of pleasing sadness upon the
banks of Lake Leman — the man who devoted his blood
to the cause of Greece, and who was finally bled to death
at Missolonghi.
Both of us were in the feverish frame of mind arising
from a sense of injury. Byron's exaltation of spirit showed
itself in unnatural mirth — mine in profound despondency.
But his frantic laughter and my frantic tears sprang from
à common source. Would that the bitterness of Cecil
Danby could have qualified the waters of Helicon to ferti-
lise so fair a field as that which overshadows with laurels
the name and grave of my noble friend! But while Byron
was plucking the stars from their spheres to form a circlet
that might supersede his crown of thorns, a wreath of
nettles was the utmost I could hope to accomplish. His
ardent soul soared into the majestic altitudes of heaven,
while the sublunary eyes of Cis Danby were evermore
riveted upon the waste places of this world.
As I said just now, in speaking of my poor lost Arthur,
we bring with us into this shabby little planet, a reflection
of the heavenly light from which our souls are emitted ;
but the longer we live the more the earthly particles obtain
the ascendancy over its brightness, and blot out the spark
divine. Our clay becomes mud, and the effulgence of our
spirit,
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light,
That's fed by stinking tallow!
I crave pardon for the homeliness of the simile ; but
Shakspeare and Molière are privileged. Like the long-
eared gentleman of antiquity, who converted everything he
touched into gold, those immortal hards have rendered
classical even tallow-candles and tartes à la crême!
Metaphors apart, as I recovered from my grief, I found
myself growing a vile materialist. The brute was begin-

ning to predominate in my nature. Nor was there any-
thing in the society of Byron and his “ co-mates and
brothers in exile” calculated to sweeten my imagination.
Most persons of very refined minds with whom I ever came
in contact, are coarse in their enjoyments as a country
squire; and the only transcendental Platonists of my ac-
quaintance are beer-bibbing German students, at the mere
recollection of whose habits of life one's gorge rises.

tation, which the Dean and Chapter of Westminster would
reprint in golden capitals, as an apology to posterity for
the decanatorial prudery which excluded his ashes from a
church where Buckingham hath a grave and Dryden a
monumental inscription.
But Byron has suffered enough at the hands of his
friends! I was near coming it Heraclitus over the world,
when those Conversations saw the light! To see the pub-
lic accept such a portraiture as that of Byron-embracing
sa lubberly postmaster's boy,” and fancying it “ sweet
Anne Page;" to see the flashing, dashing, irritable Byron
set up as a plastron to be lectured and documented —
pearls and diamonds snatched from his mouth, and toads
and frogs substituted in their stead; to find him play the
part in the dialogue, which dunce does in the Tutor's As-
sistant of modern tuition, where the little boy inquires with
much naïveté — " Mamma, does the sun go round the
earth ? ” and mamma replies, “No, Georgy! — the earth
goes round the sun ! — Georgy will be a good boy, and
know better another time.” Grant me patience or wit to
indite a new edition of the fable of the Fly on the Wheel !
Byron himself, instead of “ turning out his silver lining
on the night,” delighted to expose his blackest lining to the
day — nay, to adopt a temporary sable lining for the ex-
press purpose of making a boast of. But this is no excuse
for the perfidy of his associates.

the total deficiency of elegance of mind characterising the
women who obtained an ascendancy over him. The Bea-

butler, old Fletcher, has immortalised for the edification of
posterity his lordship’s extreme susceptibility to female do-
mination ; but after-times will discern the surpassing vul-
garity of the Betty Finnikin school to which he fell a prey
—the Miss Carolina-Wilhelmina-Amelia-Skeggs-like pre-
tensions of their refinement. The Guiccioli — Margarita —
Marianna — and others even more lavishly endowed with
what Gay, in his Newgate Pastoral, calls “the ogle of the
rattle-snake,” successively fascinated the brightest and weak-
est of mankind. But my business is to narrate my own
adventures — not those of George Gordon, Lord Byron.
For my part, I never could persuade myself to descend
to a Venus, Muse, or Grace, disfigured by a camlet petticoat.
Hy notions of beauty are essentially aristocratic. I adore
the women of Vandyke. Within the shrine of my imagi-
nation, woman stands upon a foot-cloth of velvet, lest her re-
dundant satin robes should touch this nether earth. Though
drawn up perhaps by a string of orient pearl, or a still
whiter hand — a hand of alabaster, laced by azure veins
– those garments of glistening sheen must evermore rustle
around her, as if to impart a double charm to the graceful,
trimly waist, developed by the gorgeous stomacher. I must
have her hair dishevelled into slender ringlets, to float upon
her swan-like throat and shoulders. I must have her
shapely arm, such as should enfold an emperor in its coil.
All this may be an indication of my corrupt and mere-
tricious taste. But so it is, that the fancy of Cecil Danby
must be enthralled, ere his heart submit to bondage.
The nut-brown maid is to me a homely creature; and
your neat-handed Phillis," with her “ savoury messes,"
a kitchen-girl peeling onions. I have no taste for the rural
in animated nature. Its nails are dirty — it wears black
stockings — it eschews the tooth-brush — it scratches its
head — it does a thousand revolting things. Such soul-
less, green-sward charmers should never be viewed nearer
than in one of Gainsborough’s pictures, feeding pigs or
rabbits.
At the villa Diodati, during that delicious autumn, we
indulged in a thousand chimeras, theories, and fantastical-
ities of this description. We rowed and we rode — we

sighed, or were sighed to — we learnt Italian or taught
English, with all the ardour incidental to the most intel-
lectual companionship enjoyed amid the most exquisite
scenery. After despatching to Geneva evening after even
ing poor Polidori, (who was of an age and features to
trouble his head concerning the suffrage of any two or three
that might be gathered together anywhere, and to fancy
that well-dressed people assembled in a well-lighted room,
tale quale, constituted society,) Byron and I used to go and
enjoy ourselves under the canopy of heaven when there
was moonlight, or remain ensconced in a comfortable room
when there was not, enjoying our reminiscences and com-
parative notes of the London world.
Gad ! how we talked them over — the young women
who had wanted to marry us, and the old ones we had
wanted to unmarry! — the suppers at Watier's — the
dinners at Holland House — the breakfasts in St. James's
Place ! I cannot conceive how Byron, conscious as he
was of the deep sympathy of the few, could trouble himself
about the antipathy of the many. All the master-spirits of
the age went hand-in-hand with him. All the first-rate
women and first-rate men despised the absurd calumnies
which encircled him, innocuous as serpents hissing round
the pedestal of a statue. It was only the very silly people
whom we paraded for our diversion in the glasses of our
magic lantern, who fancied themselves elevated above his
head by distinctions about as honourable as the exaltation
of a chimney-sweep on a gate-post.
Shelley, who was essentially a poet, a man who had kept
aloof from the deteriorating vulgarisms of conventional life, Shis
was sometimes amazed at the platitudes which derived pi-
quancy in our imaginations from associations of which he
knew nothing. He would have been shocked, perhaps, but
that his mind was endued with the indulgence of true
greatness. He was not, however, long an inmate under
the same roof ; and it was chiefly during his absence that
we burnt in effigy the bores and blues of London fashion ;
for it happened that during the last season we had enjoyed
there together, the greatest bores were blue, and the greatest
blues, bores — beginning with Madame de Stael, who, out

of a book, was as insupportable as others within one. She
was however so civil to us when we visited her at Copet,
that we had not courage to apply the tar-barrel to Corinne;
more especially as the mild and intelligent Albertine (the
Duchesse de Broglie) was just then her inmate, to urge the
plea of “ Grace pour maman!”
Madame de Stael, by the way, made a first and last at-
tempt to reconcile Byron to his wife ; and it was after an
interview with her upon the subject, that he flung into the
fire the MS. of a brighter piece of prose than had been
penned in Switzerland since the desolation of Ferney,
though bright with a livid brightness, savouring of the
reflection of the flames of eternal punishment. But it is
useless for a man to attempt to extinguish the spark within
him ; and the spirit which had suggested the tale, called
66 The Wife of Belphegor,” soon afterwards burst forth in
the scarcely less vivid stanzas of Don Juan !
On quitting Diodati, we travelled together to Venice.
It is something to have visited Verona, the birth and burial-
place of Juliet, with the creator of Zuleika, Leila, Medora,
Gulnare! Everybody knows, who knows a great poet, that
poets are the least poetical of God's or the devil's creatures,
unless when hanging over a sheet of wirewove, crowquill in
hand. However, we really were struck by the splendour of
the amphitheatre ; and if I did not quite sympathise in
Byron's interest in the stone horse-trough, which passes
as the tomb of the daughter of the Montecchi, or rather
of the daughter of Bandello and Shakspeare, our hearts
melted together at dinner that day over a flask of Monte
Pulciano and a dish of ortolons, “ that might have pleased
a dean.”
That autumn witnessed the brightest efflorescence of
Lord Byron's genius—" the third canto of Childe Harold,”
“ The Prisoner of Chillon,” « Darkness,' “ The Dream"
—each a chef-d'æuvre, sprung to light during his sojourn at
Diodati, as if evoked out of the surrounding glories of
nature, like the mighty Afrits conjured by Maugraby out
of the recesses of the Caucasus. Manfred was now fer-
menting in his soul — immortal Manfred !- No wonder
if he became sometimes uncognisant of Cecil Danby.

Once settled at Venice, matters grew worse. The too
celebrated Marianna shared his attentions with the Witch
of the Alps ; and I consequently released myself from the
duties of Dumbmy. Leaving him to the undisputed en-
joyment of his lodgings in the Spezieria, I took up my
abode in a grand gloomy apartment of the Palazzo Gritti,
on the Canal Grande, surrendering myself a prisoner at dis-
cretion to the enchantments, animate and inanimate, of that
city of poetical illusions.
Dear reader, -I perceive your consternation. Do me)
justice !- Did I bore you with Mont Blanc on the shores
of Leman, or the Drachenfels on those of the Rhine, that
you should suspect me of an intention to crush you under
the weight of the Rialto, during my sojourn on those of the
Canalaccio ? With Beppo on your shelf, and (unless you
wear a surplice or a muslin frock) Don Juan hidden be-
hind an edition of Chesterfield's works, Heaven forbid I
should inflict upon you so much as the description of a
gondola! Everybody worth speaking of, or speaking to, la
who ever dipped pen in ink, has had a daub at Venice ; 1
Shakspeare and Schiller — Byron and Beckford Lewis
and Cooper - Lady Morgan and George Sand, have pro-
jected their shadows on the lagune - or at least images
that came like shadows, but have not so departed.
I may therefore very well hold myself exempt from
dwelling upon mildewed palaces. Canaletti has shown
you all you need to know of the aspect of the spot -
Where Venice sits in state, throned on her hundred isles ;
and Prout and. Stanfield have added an appendix and list
of errata to his pages.
Fancy yourself, therefore, in Venice. After all the
painting and printing of the last three centuries, this is
surely no great stretch of imagination.
But you must fancy me also in Venice-a good-looking
misanthrope, as black in hat, coat, and countenance as a
gondola ; while Byron was polishing his periods or lisping
Venetian-blue Venetian—with Countess Albrizzi, and
Venetian couleur de rose with Marianna -

I went sauntering about, fancying myself into a Pagan in
the mosque of St. Mark, and more than a Christian in the
church of San Giorgio Maggiore ; a pigmy on the scala dei
giganti-- a giant amid the solitudes of the Lido. I even
breathed the sighs exacted of every traveller who respects
himself, on the Ponte dei Sospiri ; and had serious thoughts
of inditing a sonnet to Liberty, after viewing the pozzi and
piombi, but that, conceiving Byron would not let slip so
golden an opportunity, I judged it more convenient to say
“ ditto to Mr. Burke.”
The tranquillity by day, the vivid animation by night,
consequent on the opening carnival, were however anything
but favourable to those same metre ballad-mongers, who
require a night as silent and solemn as the frost-bound
stillness of some northern city, disturbed only by the
hoarse denunciations of the town clock, telling the time
austerely as that which, in the unfathomable abyss, pro-
claimeth to the souls in torment that Eternity rules the
hour!
I don't know how Childe Harold managed to get on
with his stanzas; but, as far as I am concerned, I swear I
never felt less romantic than in the city of romance. The
lights of the coffee-houses dazzled my eyes, whenever I
tried to grow pathetic with Jaffier on the Rialto; and I
had not been a month in the place before I saw as clearly
as that Byron was making an ass of himself for love of a
linendraper's wife, that I should quit Venice myself with-
out so much as the shadow of an adventure. When lo!
one evening, of all the days of the year the festival of
St. Stephen-being that which immediately succeeds the
feast of the Nativity, and nearly of as much account
among the minions and dominions of the Austrian house
of bondage, I was gondola-ing it lazily home to the Pa-
lazzo Gritti, when, on nearing the platform of St. Mark,
my ears were startled by the tumultuous joy of the mul.
titude assembled in honour of this popular holiday. The
strumming of guitars, the explosion of petards, the shouts

of the merry populace, seemed to send their demonstrations
gladsomely into the sky—a far more cheering evidence of
affection to the dilapidated saint in his honour, than all
the penances and flagellations borne by poor, foolish, hum-
bugged human nature.
Startled by the vivacities of the hour, I determined to
alight for a nearer survey of the Venetian commonalty. A
crowd in England (as I have some thought of standing for
Finsbury, let me beware of calling it a mob!)—a popular
assemblage in England is the dullest looking thing in
nature. Its dinginess seems arrayed in sackcloth and
ashes, diversified here and there by the diabolism of a
chimney-sweep, black with the sins and soot of a sea-coal-
fire-warmed generation, too selfish to sweep its flues with
machinery. In gazing on a mass of this description, one
might fancy, indeed, that the House of Hanover ruled
over a nation of dustmen.
In Italy, on the contrary, a rainbow in the sky has fewer
hues and gradations of hues than a crowd upon the earth.
Nothing of the monotonous dreariness of vesture of the
pallid north. Blue, bright as the skies — scarlet, glaring
as their suns - match with the vividness of the bronzed
cheek, coal-black hair, and pearl-white teeth of the abo-
rigines. All is gay and brilliant as a parterre of tulips.
The aristocracy of Venice probably assumed its black array
to distinguish itself from the parti-coloured garments of the
Scaramuccian ol molloi.
As I stood at the foot of the Campanile, wrapt in my
cloak, and fancying I could discern in the frosty air a lin-
gering trace of the incense dispensed by the processions of
the day, or emitted from the great portal of St. Mark,
where vespers were at that moment in course of solemni-
sation, I perceived that the crowd, thicker in my vicinity
than at the further extremity of the platform, was attracted
by a company of jugglers or posture-masters, who were
exhibiting their feats, “supported,” as we say on the en-
tablatures of our hospitals, “ by voluntary contributions.”
I don't happen to care about posture masters or jug-
glers, or any other privileged distortionists of the human
frame. I hate learned animals, or unlearned tumblers,

just as I hate conversation-men at a dinner party, because
they pretend to achieve more than was chalked out for
them by nature. I consequently did not so much as raise
my eyes over the shoulders of the crowd, to see what sort
of feats these wonder-workers were perpetrating. I heard
the people shout, as if Cæser were before them, putting
aside the crown. But, Lord ! what will not the people
shout for?-
While I waited there, contemplating for the hundredth
time the beauties of the Loggetta, which seemed to gather
a new and more romantic charm from the softening shades
of evening, like a fair woman peeping through a veil —
musing upon the fall of the winged lion, and other casual-
ties of Venice, and repeating between my teeth the flight
of the French rhapsodist —
Voyageur, à qui Venise
Se dévoile après le jour,
Si ton âme ailleurs est prise,
Que je plains ton autre amour !
Des Princesses de l'Italie,
C'est Venise, chaque matin,
Qui s'éveille la plus jolie
Dans les fleurs et le satin !
for, having resolved on making my début the following
night at the ridotto, I was beginning to form surmises
concerning Venice in her masque and brocade, even while
contemplating the pastimes of the Piazza.
In the midst of my meditations my ear was startled by
an altercation in a harsh jargon, differing strangely from
the bird-like sibillation of the Venetian patois.
Few things attract my attention sooner than an unfami-
liar dialect. To me there is something as mysterious in
its influence on the ear, as in that of hieroglyphics on the
eye. I fancy hidden treasures of knowledge concealed in
its perplexities, and new developments of sentiment or
passion encoiled within its phrases ; and though the
promise is usually fulfilled, like most of the promises
I make my Self, by the discovery that all human
tongues serve to convey the same trivialities, and that the
words which sounded supernatural as the soliciting of the
Weird Sisters only enabled Jack to exclaim, that he was

hungry, or inquire after the health of Jill, the same feeling
would be renewed, were I at this moment in the centre of
a circle of Tschusans, hearing them and asking them
questions.
I was roused from my reverie to wonder what these two
squabblers on the Piazza were quarrelling about. One of
the voices was rough as the coating of a pine ; the other,
sweet and unctuous as its kernel ; for I speak Zecca-larly
of the pines in the forest, not Bond-street-wise, of those
of the succession-house. The contra-basso was that of a
“salvage man,” a hard-looking, masculine fellow of forty,
Saracenic in beard and proportions, arrayed in a pale-blue
jerkin, with white trowsers, and a shaggy sash of red silk
twisted round his middle ; while the girl he was addressing,
a fragile-looking thing, light as an antelope and flexile as a
cane, was attired in a yet more fanciful costume-a span-
gled, close-fitting bodice of green velvet, her black hair
braided Albanian-wise, and falling upon her naked shoul-
ders; while muslin shoes and trowsers of ample fold
formed her sole defence against the nipping air of a
Christmas evening. The case was clear ; these people
were part of the company of funambulists.
The dispute ran high. The girl kept retreating towards
the foot of the Campanile ; and the man, evidently the
master, following her with what sounded most barbarously
like menaces and imprecations. If mistaken in the mean-
ing of his spoken accents, I could not be in the expressive
idiom of the foot that stamped on the pavement, or the
swarthy fist that clenched itself in her face. Still less
could I misinterpret the gasping sounds, half sob, half
groan, that burst from the bosom of the damsel.
To have inquired of either the cause or purport of the
dispute, would have been much the same as to ask the ques-
tion of the granite lions of St. Mark; but I kept close at
hand, determined to interpose in favour of the girl, should
it appear advisable. She was shuddering with cold ; and
the withering effect of the atmosphere seemed to pinch her
features and dilate her large dark eyes, orbed with resent-
ments such as ought to have kept the blood circulating in
her poor blue cheeks and hands.

Never did I behold so graceful a creature! Angiolini
might have borrowed attitudes from the instinctive move-
ments of her gracile frame. — Every menace, every impulse
that uplifted her arm, was a study. At length, some bit-
terer word than the rest so excited the fury of her task-
master, that a brutal blow of his fist almost felled her to
the earth. I started forward to retaliate: sure that, how-
ever faulty the girl, he was fifty-fold more condemnable ;
when, lo! with the velocity of lightning, she plucked from
her girdle a stiletto I had not before noticed among the
accompaniments of her Greek costume, and was about to
avenge herself in a manner more summary than lawful.
As her best defence, instead of laying low her antagonist,
I snatched the poniard from her grasp, and prevented the
commission of a crime which would have sentenced to the
axe of the executioner the most beauteous head I ever
looked on!
She was about to turn upon me more infuriated than
she had been against her tyrant, when a huge phlegmatic
schwab of an Austrian soldier, who had witnessed the affray
(probably on duty, lest upon St. Stephen's-day there should
be an uproar among the people), seized her by the shoulder ;
adding certain Germanic expositions of the law, somewhat
more comprehensible to me than the outcries of the two
rope-dancers.
Whenever justice takes people's business into her hands,
every human being present begins to talk at once, as if the
goddess of the scales had as many ears, as Rumour tongues.
In order to enable the animal in the white and blue uni-
form to lend one of his two exclusively to myself, I slid
into his hand as much of his emperor's particularly base
coin as it would contain ; and persuaded him, in sufficiently
bad German, that I was the only sufficient and credible
witness of what had occurred.
The girl, regarding as an enemy, drew away from me
with an intensity of scowl that must have disfigured beauty
less remarkable than hers; while I gathered from the ex-
planation of the Austrian soldier that these people were
Zigeuner belonging to a gang of Hungarian tumblers, who
had come to Venice from the fair of Trieste, to gather a few

sequins during the Carnival ere they returned to their set-
tlement in the Carpathians ; that the brute whom I con-
sidered the girl's master, was not only her master, but her
father, — and that the crime which I had contemplated as
assassination, would consequently have been parricide. —
The girl still shivered and chattered, not only with her
teeth but her tongue; and her words probably conveyed
further threats of violence, for the soldier kept assuring
her, that unless she amended her intentions, he should be
under the necessity of conveying her to the guard-house on
the Zecca, where, in consequence of the holiday, she would
be locked in for the night.
“ Do !” cried she, with clasping hands and earnest eyes.
“Do lock me in for the night. I implore,— I beseech
you!”
“Without fire or candle on St. Stephen's day, child,"
replied the soldier, “ is no such treat as you may suppose;
- to say nothing of the sentence that might perhaps await
you in the morning.”
“Better than the fate that certainly awaits me, if left at
liberty to-night !” — cried the girl, her bosom heaving with
suppressed emotion ; “ to be starved, beaten, and thrust
out here in the cold, exposed to the insults of the boatmen,
and all the other brutes who stand to see me harassed and
tormented. I am his daughter; I am bound to work for
his maintenance and my own ;-I know it! But it is
written 'Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out
the corn.' There is no law for the stripes wherewith I am
goaded. I have been toiling since sunrise. I am ex-
hausted with cold and hunger; while he, as you may plainly
see, has been drinking and carousing. I told him just
now, when he was about to place the lanterns at the corner
of our carpet (to force me to go on till midnight as I have
done throughout the day), that, like other slaves, I must
have food and rest; — above all, that he must abide by me,
lest I should be used as I was last evening on this very
spot. He derided me, - is that like a father? He struck
me,-- is that like a father? He "

side, had not the stranger yonder prevented you !” inter-

rupted the man, who perceived that the sympathy of the
standers-by was enlisting itself with the oppressed. -
“ You would have stabbed me!- Is that, I ask you, like
a daughter ?”
“ It is like your daughter, - for you murdered my
mother. - Never deny it!-You murdered her. Though
acquitted for want of evidence, did not the tribunal of
Bröny bid you go and repent?”
“ I strongly recommend you to take this girl into cus-
tody,” said I, addressing the soldier, after watching, as well
as the deepening shades of evening would permit, the fero-
cious countenance of the Zigeun. “Here is my address
at the Palazzo Gritto. I will appear as your witness to-
morrow. I am convinced that if you leave her at liberty,
there will be bloodshed before morning."
“ There will, - there shall !” added the girl in her
former sweet voice, so strangely at variance with the fright-
ful purport of her words. " I surrender myself your pri-
soner; and unless you accept me as such, this night shall
see the last of him or me!”
The fellow in the crimson sash protested, however, ve-
hemently against the arrest; promising to bestow paternal
coercion upon the damsel, if left to his care. For a mo-
ment, the soldier, whose purpose of enjoying the fiddlings
of the fête was grievously interrupted by the duties of
office, had evidently a mind to comply. But a crowd was
beginning to gather, inquiring, in a thousand Venetian lis-
pations, the meaning of the affray; and the strong good
sense of a popular assemblage, not bamboozled by what is
called eloquence, is pretty sure to decide in the right. The
Gondolieri and their feminine gender insisted that the girl
ought to be taken to the royal and imperial guard-house on
the Zecca, and thither she was accordingly conveyed. Her
father would fain have followed, but there were her two
fellow exhibitors, the learned ape, and the poodle dog who
showed tricks on the cards, to be taken care of ; – to say
nothing of the piece of faded church-tapestry which offi-
ciated as their footcloth, the lanterns belonging to its four
corners, and the chest which contained the wardrobes of all
four, and served as a stage to the performers. These de-

manded his paternal and proprietorial protection quite as
much as his refractory child.
I alone, therefore, followed the soldier and the girl. I
even insisted on her being conveyed in my gondola ; for the
populace, at the sound of the word “assassin,” was crowd-
ing fearfully upon her.
When we entered the gondola, instead of taking her seat
on the bench (no restraint being imposed on her by her
companions), she flung herself headlong on the carpet, and
sobbed audibly. It was dark. But I could feel her writh-
ing on the floor at our feet. I began to wish that I had
hit upon some less rigorous mode of extricating her from
the hands of her despot; and even offered a second handful
of coin to the soldier to let me land him on the quay of the
Canal Reggio, or anywhere else he pleased, and set free his
unhappy prisoner.
But the man told me in good set German that my pro-
position came to late ;—that the wench must be imprisoned
that night, appear before the magistrates on the morrow,
and perhaps be sent to work in the Idrian mines before the
week was over! He had no longer an election in the mat-
ter. Hundreds had seen her taken into custody,--hun-
dreds would be ready to bear witness against him, should
he fail in his duty.
On one point I was myself resolved ;--that I would not
surrender to her the dagger which I still held under my
cloak. The temptation might be too strong for that young
and impetuous creature, imprisoned in silence, solitude,
cold, and hunger, on a winter's night! Time enough to
return it to her at the tribunal the following morning.
The soldier who had refused my second gratuity as a bribe
for her escape, accepted it as an argument with the ser-
geant on duty, that she should be gently used, and provided
with food and covering in her cell; and Franszetta,- for
such I discovered from her father's imprecations to be her
name,- so far recognised my care for her preservation, as
to seize my hand and cover it with kisses.
There was something in the movement, as she lay there
crouching at my feet, so resembling the mute endearments
of one of the brute creation, that I felt towards her at that

moment as one feels towards an affectionate and grateful
hound, whose caresses are his only mode of demonstrating
attachment.
After seeing her safely deposited by my friend in the
white uniform in the hands of an Austrian bombadier, who
looked like a wooden Goliath and smelt like a tobacconist's
shop, - I dashed into my gondola again, and bad the
men make off in haste to Byron's lodgings in the Spezieria.
I knew he was to dine with the Contessa Albrizzi, and
conceived that he would meet there certain of her Venetian
acquaintance, who might put me in the way of befriending
the Signorina Franszetta, by means of more fluent Italian
and better law than I could possibly pretend to. Besides,
if the truth must out, I was not sorry to have a little ad-
venture to recount, and a heroine to boast of, in return for
the eleven thousand with which he had favoured me in the
course of our confidences.
“A tumbler - a gipsy — a stabber in the dark, — yet
pure as Lucretia, and beautiful as a houri?” cried he, pro-
ceeding with his toilet, while I, with as much embellish-
ment as prose and honesty would permit, proceeded with
my narrative. “Come, come! you are practising on my
ingenuousness; or you have been drinking healths to St.
Stephen in choice alkermès in one of the booths of the
Piazza! Assassinate her father, with half the gondoliers
in Venice as witnesses of the act? These things are not
done under the leaden mace of Austria! Even the Zigeuner
know better. Remember this is the 20th day of December,
Cis, my man,-not the 1st of April.”
Put on my mettle by these insinuations, I chose also to
be on my metal. I produced my stiletto. It was a short
blade, formed like, though smaller in dimensions, a Malay
kriss. The blade was of a lustreless complexion, and had
a peculiar musky smell, like that emitted by the rattlesnake;
and on the hilt, which was of virgin gold, was a single
rough carbuncle. Nothing could be ruder than the work.

one of the early efforts of a tasteful but unenlightened
people.

Byron was curious in arms; and he examined this cir-
cumspectly, by sight and scent, from hilt to point.
: “ Tell me in what Armenian armourer's shop you made
your purchase," said he, for I would gladly have its
fellow. I have not seen such a poniard since I left the
East. I once had one made, almost on its model, for a
fair London friend of mine, who has since, I suspect, often
longed to send me with it to assist in solving the grand
problem.”
"I have half a mind to do as much myself,” cried I,
“as a punishment for your incredulity! - Come with me,
however, to-morrow to the police-office on the Zecca, which
is closed on account of the fête to-night, and you will see
Franszetta delivered up to justice, and perhaps assist me
in extricating her therefrom.”
That night, I met him at the Fenice, whither he had
accompanied Countess Albrizzi and a party of noble Paduan
friends; and he still persisted in quizzing me upon my
adventure, as if no one but himself had ever swum in a
gondola or caught a heroine.
But even I, after spending the night in dreaming of
Franszetta, - her grace, her beauty, her arrow-like ac-
tivity, her impetuous ferocity of character, —even I woke
in the morning, almost convinced in my turn that the
whole had been the baseless fabric of a vision.
The dagger lay on my table, in refutation of the sug-
gestion. Again, I examined its serpent-smelling blade,
and cabalistic-looking carbuncle ; and as I passed my
sleeve over both, half expected to see some slave of the
dagger start up, in the form of an eastern genie, to reprove
my unbelief.
There was no time to wait for his appearance. I had
slept so long to dream of the wild-eyed Franszetta (whose
name, by the way, I beseech such of my readers as read
aloud, to pronounce Franchetta) that I had brought it
nearly to twelve o'clock, — the time for opening the
tribunal.
Byron had promised not only to bear me company, but
to assist me with the advice and authority of a grave old
gentleman in black, who wrote himself procuratore or avvo-

cato, and was recommended to him by the Armenian Fa-
thers for the care of his secular affairs. We were both in
high spirits, — he, in anticipation of a novel and perhaps
exciting scene, -1, in the expectation of a second glimpse
of the strange being in whose destiny I was interesting
myself, as well as in the hope of overcrowing my com-
panion.
I was not, however, altogether satisfied to exhibit the
charms of my gipsy beauty to so accomplished a conosciatore.
The imaginative wildness of eye and gesture of Franszetta
could not fail to enchant a man with so much music in his
soul. Still greater would be the fascination of her reckless
desperation, - of her wayward humour. Byron was at-
taining that epoch in the life of a sinful son of clay and
clubs, hlasé with the softer pleasures of the heart, when
nothing is so exciting as the turbulence of a virago. It
was not long afterwards that Margarita Cogni obtained an
ascendency over him by smashing looking-glasses in their
lover's quarrels, and pulling his raven curls till he roared
again.
I had a presentiment that Franszetta would become his
idol ; and my mien was grave in proportion to my fears,
as we ascended together the stone steps of the police-office,
to which the double-bodied eagle of Austria was affixed,
like a bird of prey to a barn, by way of warning to addle-
headed birds still on the wing.
There stood the soldier, there the sergeant. — There
sat the official in his black silk robe. There lay before
him an open book, containing his registry of committals.
In every corner of the office lurked the smell of tobacco,
and the dirty dogs of sbirri, by whose garments and head-
gear it was emitted. But in the way of female prisoner, as
the French say,- pas plus que sur ma main!
Byron laughed heartily; and, but for shame, I could
have as heartily cried. The Signor Dottore, meanwhile, whº
wore as solemn a countenance as if “ from Padua, — from
Bellario," — took the wiser course of interrogating the
wooden sergeant and his equally stolid witness, the soldier.
It appeared that on the preceding night Franszetta had
been locked into her cell, wherein was a rug-bed for the

úse of prisoners, and the provisions I had bespoken for her,
together with an iron lamp, for which irregular and illegal
enjoyment she was also indebted to my gratuities.
In the morning the lamp stood there, untrimmed, - the
supper untasted, — but the bed not untouched ; — for the
sheet was found attached to the stancheons of a window,
grated in proportion to the ordinary dimensions of prisoners
in guard-rooms, and not purporting to shut in a fairy or a
rope-dancer. The inner frame of the window was broken;
and there were ensanguined traces on the glass and sheet,
as if the enterprise had not been achieved without diffi-
culty.
But had it been achieved ? — had she escaped ? — The
chamber from which she had made her attempt was on
the third or highest floor of the old guard-house of the
Zecca, abutting against the canal. The street reached only
to the stone ledge surmounting the rustic basement; and
from this height she must have sprung into the canal, or
crept along the ledge with a degree of skill and intrepidity
worthy of Fenella !
Byron suggested that not even a cat could have done it;
while the soldiers swore as stoutly, that by dropping into
the canal in the dead of the night, at such a degree of
cold, she could not have intended escape, but suicide. One
thing was clear, – that the course of justice was defeated,
- that the prisoner was gone, and my sole consolation
lay in the fact, that before we quitted the royal and im-
perial police office, the brute with the Saracenic physiog-
nomy made his appearance, growling and blaspheming at
the announcement of his daughter's disappearance; - a
plain proof, that whatever evil had betided her, she was
not in his power.
The fear of being laughed at, which operates so dis-
gracefully upon our actions in this weakest of worlds, pre-
vented my following up my inquiries as I wished to do,
and perhaps ought to have done. I had quizzed Byron so
unmercifully about his passion for the linendraper's wife,
that I felt satisfied he would cruelly retaliate upon mine
for a mountebank, if I evinced even ordinary interest in
Franszetta's destinies.

So I went my ways home, and pondered upon these
things. I have always felt deep sympathy in the gipsy
race -
Tribe of the wandering foot and weary breast, –
that most peculiar and especial race, which, whether de-
rived of Ishmael or Cain, surviveth in all the countries of
the old world, to attest that it is not upon the Jews only
that the hand of election or reprobation hath set its seal.
Independent of the beauty and grace of this strange girl —
independent of the interest attached to her sad position - I
earnestly desired to see her again; to interrogate her, as
well as my imperfect German would admit, concerning the
usages of her people and her erratic habits of life.
I felt, therefore, like a child robbed of its toy, on dis-
covering that I was to see no more of her. But for the
stiletto, I should have almost begun to doubt whether I
had ever seen her at all. There it was, however, safe
within my vest; and the warmth of my bosom bringing
forth its musky odour, till I could almost have fancied a
nest of snakes was coiling around me.
Altogether, my mood was somewhat mystical and Hoff-
mann-ish! — I had heard the preceding night, for the
first time, Rossini's opera of “ Otello';" — in my opinion,
the only really serious opera ever produced by that beau -
tiful but essentially unspiritual composer. With the ex-
ception of a few passages in the “ Semiramide,” nothing
of his ever touched me so nearly. The scene of Desde-
mona's tapestried chamber in the second act, at the Fenice,
was a fac-simile of the one I occupied in the Palazzo Gritti;
— and albeit no one who knows Venice, where
Tasso's echoes are no more,
And silent rows the songless gondolier,
would expect to find a line from Dante conveyed to him
by a fine bass voice from the Canal Grande, I confess that
after hearing the
Nessun maggior dolor
Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
Nella miseria,
breathe so touching an interruption to the woes of Desde-
mona, I felt that I should never pace my dark and some-

what fantastic chamber after the drowsy bell had stricken
midnight, without expecting some such mournful ejacu-
lation to startle its appalling stillness.
That day, I dined with Byron at the Pellegrino; and
bore at the hands of my friend a series of whips and
stings, which he, who made no secret of his susceptibility
to quizzing, ought not to have inflicted. — Nay, he was
So wondrous witty in twitting me with Mignon, and
branding me with the name of Wilhelm Meister, that I
was obliged to silence him by declaring that, if I had
stolen my love-passage from Goethe's romance, he had pil-
fered from it his opening stanza in the Bride of Abydos;
vindicating himself with a protest of not knowing a word
of German, when every ignoramus of us was familiarised
with the verses in question, by the translation in Madame
de Stael's clever rhapsody on Germany.
He was almost angry;- for, sooth to say, we were
drinking deeper than was the practice of either; and I
was glad to divert his attention from my charge, by bring-
ing forward a favourite theory of mine concerning the said
Lehrjahr : - that in Mignon and Albertine, the poet in-
tended to typify Celestial and Terrestrial Love, just as
Shakspeare personified the two extremes of the Giesterwelt,
- the sylph and gnome,- in the Ariel and Caliban of his
Enchanted Island - a psychological antithesis of the hap-
piest kind.
“ Upon this hint he spake;" — and when Byron really
spoke, I deny any man of sense, in his senses, to do aught
but listen!
It was late when I got home from a second representation
of the thrilling “Otello," — of which, however, we heard
only a fragment; but it was a fragment that contained the .
Preghiera, the “ Sono innocente !” — the “ Perfido-in.
grato!” — and the catastrophe; and which consequently
Sent the hearers weeping to their beds.

dering, partly with cold, partly with discomfiture. My

up the fire-place with logs, to cheer me through a night
which I felt was to be sleepless. My mind seemed in a
state of somnambulism; my pillow only redoubled my
sense of restlessness. With the desperation of all nervous
persons, I left my curtains undrawn, that I might com-
mand, as I lay, the whole extent of my chamber, and ad.
mire the design of its tapestry, whereon was expressed,
with becoming sadness, the death of Adonis, exhibited in
his last agonies, giving up the ghost in the depths of a
wood gloomy as the pine-forest of Ravenna.
Right opposite to my bed, whose venerable draperies were
of dingy velvet, graced by a valance of old Venice point,
stood a huge mirror upon an old-fashioned toilet-table,
Venetian also, both in point of point and of glass ; and to
the right of the bed, at some twenty paces betwixt it and
the mirror, a table, whereon, previous to betaking myself
to rest, I deposited Franszetta's stiletto.
I was in the strangest mood of mind. All the be-
wilderments that wine, music, and romance, introduce
into the interstices of a somewhat spongy brain, were
seething and fermenting in mine. I was possessed by that
demon of Doubt which seems suddenly to subdue the
mind, and deprive all things, earthly and unearthly, of
their stability. Every object, in and out of nature, be-
came suddenly a matter of inquiry and misgiving. The
society of Byron usually operated upon me like a dose of
opium ; not as a narcotic, but the origin of a trance wherein
the body becomes transfixed while the soul acquires preter-
natural activity.
In just such a state of clairvoyance was I now !—My
spirit “o'er-informed its tenement of clay.” I began to
see or imagine those things in heaven or earth, which in
Horatio's philosophy were undreamed of. Before my
mind's eye fitted the forms of the trembling Desdemona
of the Fenice; of Mignon, out-mignoned by the busy fancy
and fervid eloquence of Byron ; and of Franszetta, as she
stood on the platform of St. Mark's, rage flashing in her
eyes, and the stiletto flashing in her hand !
The atmosphere seemed instinct with aërial beings to
my nympholeptic and delirious fancy.

The night was bitter and cutting as the Arctic Circle or
a conjugal retort, and cheerless as it was chilling. But for
the crackling of the fire upon the hearth, I could scarcely
have borne the sad wailing of the wind, driving showers
of sleet against the windows, seeming to sob at intervals,
like the moans of a soul in torment. The very tapestry
was heaved from the wall by these searching gusts. Every-
thing looked portentous. Everything sounded like an
omen. The very bell of St. Mark's, as it struck the hours,
had an appalling vibration that night, as if conscious that
evil was betiding !
I was beginning to feel that even the chirrup of a cricket
on the hearth would be a comfort to me, as token of the
presence of a living thing—when, lo! right across the
mirror, on which the brightness of the fire-light was re-
flected, flitted a shadow-the shadow of a human form,
In our conversations at Diodati the preceding autumn,
our little circle of illuminati had so often indulged in
daring speculations touching the world of spirits, (specu-
lations that gave rise to Byron's Fragment, Polidori's Vam-
pire, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,) that I own I in-
dulged a little in the superstition reproved by St. Paul.
I am not ashamed to admit my weakness. People are fond
of attributing such imaginings to scepticism, as if the re-
appearance of the dead were not an especial article of
Christian belief. For my part, I hold with the highest of
all authorities, that fear is the beginning of Wisdom ; and
that those who begin by deriding the spilling of the salt,
will end by mocking the overthrow of the altar! This is
not a pure excuse for my own frailty. I do not blush to
admit that, at sight of that passing shadow, my breath
came as short as that of the lover of Honoria, as he stood,
horror-struck, in the demon-haunted forest!
My second thought, or rather my first, for some seconds
elapsed before I had courage to think at all-was that some
person was concealed in my chamber. My next impulse,
to start up, and rush to the table where lay the stiletto of
Franszetta.
It was gone !
Though certain as I lived, that the last thing I had done

after Berto's quitting the room and my bolting it for the
night, was to place it on the table, from which I had
scarcely since withdrawn my eyes, - it was no longer
there!
I was now assured that some one was in the room, pro-
bably with a murderous purpose. Yet, instead of pro-
ceeding to an immediate examination, by beating the
curtains, the draperies, and the angles formed by one or
two ponderous cabinets, I contented myself with taking
from the latter my pocket-pistols, which, after Byron's
fashion, I kept always charged ; and laying them beside
me on the bed, to which I retreated. By lying quiet, I
might encourage the miscreant to come forth and meet his
fate.
The bed, I must tell you, dear reader, as you may never
have been a lodger in the Palazzo Gritti, stood in a recess,
with a space around it, to admit the passage of a servant.
Between me and the wall, therefore, was an ambush. The
curtains were drawn. I had perhaps only to tear them
aside, and discover the ferocious eyes of an assassin glaring
upon me. Yet I refrained! I felt as if acting under the
pressure of supernatural agency. I kept my eyes fixed
upon the glass, expecting to see the shadow traverse it as
before. But though I strained them with watching, no-
thing appeared. I fancied however, so full of fancies
does one become in situations of this kind, that I heard
the breath of a concealed person - nay, a sigh, a deep sigh,
uttered so close to me, that I was able, as it were, to feel
the invisible presence !
There was no bearing this. I was about to snatch up
the pistols that lay on the bed, and discharge one of them
by way of warning ; when, lo! on extending my hand --
they were gone also !
Great God !- what was the meaning of all this? Was
I losing my senses, or was I about to lose my life? It
was useless to affect bravado. It would only hasten my
fate, to rush forth, detect, and challenge my enemy. All
I had to do was to recommend myself to Heaven-not
tremble if I could help it, and be as still as death!
Still enough, perhaps, I was destined to be, shortly !

Some five minutes elapsed, which my agitation converted •
into twice as many hours, when I became convinced that
the respiration which I still distinctly heard, proceeded not
from behind the ponderous curtain, by which the sound
must have been stifled, but from the open side of the bed.
My immediate impulse was to thrust forth my hand.
As instantly did it encounter an object-a clay-cold cheek,
—the touch of which thrilled through my frame like a
bolt of ice!
The flickering fire-light at that moment threw up a
tongue of flame; enabling me to perceive a female figure,
seated upon the velvet hassock that lay beside my bed, to
enable me to climb into its lofty altitudes; a female figure,
of exceeding loveliness !
I beseech my reader to cry aloud, in the eager tone of
Mrs. Siddons in Lady Randolph-

The locks of youngeir sleeping eye som of Paradise..
And then she gaily wandered through the world
Wherein her fancy led her, and would stray
(The sails of her bright meteor wings unfurl'd)
Through many a populous city, and survey
The chambers of the sleeping; oft she curl'd
The locks of young chaste maidens as they lay,
And lit new lustre in their sleeping eyes,
And breathed upon their cheeks the bloom of Paradise.

of their ball of cotton. Just when we have made some
agonising discovery, or are expecting the consummation
of the event that is to complete our happiness or plunge us
into irremediable woe, in proses the bore, with a long-
winded story about nothing, causing us to send him, by
mental execration, to a spot whereunto the best railroad
going would require half a dozen ages for his conveyance !
No doubt my readers are at this moment favouring me
with some such gentle apostrophe. I therefore cut short a
very interesting article upon apparitions and spectra, which
I had intended to insert at this place, to heighten the in-
terest, and by what the Yankees call " piling up the
agony," prove that I am a tolerable dab at fine writing, a
species of composition good only “al dilettar le femine e
per la plebe."
Where was I? At the clay-cold cheek methinks, or
rather at the death-like chill which congealed the very
marrow within my bones, when I discovered the strange
motionless figure stationed at my bedside. Certes the ap-
parition had taken no very alarming shape, being that of a
fair Venetian ; not of bel sangue, not a nobil dama, not a
Mocenigo, or Gradenigo, or Albrizzi, or Benzoni, or Gri-
mani, or Balbi,—but one who would call herself " VENE-
ZIANA !”—and think it title enough, if her costume did
not sufficiently announce her to be a child of the Lagune.
I had been only a month in Venice, a month devoted to
its churches and palaces, its Titians and Giorgiones, rather
than to pursuits likely to expose me to assassination from
a female hand. I had loved nobody, and consequently no-
body had a right to hate me. But perhaps the fazziolo
might be a decoy ? The pistols and stiletto might be in
the hands of an accomplice!
This notion vanished in a moment as the figure, turning
slowly round, disclosed to me the beautiful features of
FRANSZETTA !-Franszetta domiciled in my house-cold,
sad, cheerless. The welcome I offered sufficiently ex-
pressed my sympathy.
“ No nearer, 'celenza ! ” cried she, recoiling from my
advance, and brandishing her weapon in a style almost as
resolute as she had displayed the preceding night on the

Piazza. “Should I be here, think you, but that I know
myself capable of self-defence ? Lie quietly down. The
night is cold as if man and not Providence had made it.
The Euganean hills will be white before morning. But
blessed be God, we have a good roof over our heads.
With your leave, I will throw on another log; and then
resume my place here, and say out all I have to disclose.
For I would fain retain my confidence in your goodness.
Such frankness of soul and speech as mine ought to beget
honest dealing in return.”
“Quick, quick, then, with the fire !” cried I, “for I
have a thousand questions to ask, touching your escape
last night, and the means by which you effected your en-
trance here."
“Neither exploit is much to boast of !” she replied,
obeying my behest, and after dispatching her task, resu-
ming her seat on the hassock. “ It needed only for your
domestics to keep as careless a watch as their master,
who, with his eyes fixed just now on my stiletto, suffered
me to snatch it from the table unobserved.”
She took the poniard from her bosom as she spoke, and
pressed her lips to the blade, passing it along them with
a slow and tender movement, as we caress that which is
dearest to us in the world.
“It was to claim this of you that I came," said she.
“ Before this hour to-morrow, I shall have quitted Venice.
A vessel is sailing for Fiume. From thence, I will push
my way back into our country, under the guidance of
some of our people — who, in Istria and Dalmatia, have
settlements in almost every village. But I would not de-
part without .my stiletto; no, no ! I would not go without
my stiletto. It is all I can call my own in this world.
It has been my friend in danger, my friend in desolation.
It was the dying gift of my poor, poor mother. Admit,
'celenza, that I could not leave Venice without my
stiletto ?”
“ It were more gracious if you said you would not leave
it, without seeing again one who has shown such eager dis-
positions to befriend you, Franszetta !” said I, reproach-
fully.

“Why lose our time in mutual compliments ?” replied
Franszetta, “I want you to tell me exactly what passed to-day
at the police; whether they supposed me drowned or rescued;
and what manner of threats were uttered by my father?"
I told her all. I described, with as much fluency as my
halting German would allow, the unconcealed rage, not of
the parent who had lost his child, but the juggler who had
lost his apprentice.
“ You are a shrewd guesser !” cried Franszetta, almost
with a laugh. “It were indifferent to him to leave me at
the bottom of the canal, or on the stones of the quay; for
in his heart he loathes me. No wonder. When a child
loathes its parent, there must be loathing in return. And
Heaven will forgive me the sin of hating him, — for my
mother's blood is on his hand !"-
“ Poverina ! ” — said I, directing towards her an in-
voluntary glance of pity.
“ The ape, and Grelotte, and I, between us, earned him
two hundred scudi at the fair of Trieste,” continued Frans-
zetta, resuming her usual tone, “and he expected us to
have done as much more at Verona. We were then to have
pushed on to Milan, — and so home, across the Tyrol, and
Styria. But I could stand it no longer. I have to thank
you, 'celenza, for saving me from embruing my hands in
blood; for after that, I fear, even Fridszin would not have
forgiven me.”
“ And who is Fridszin ? ” said I, prepared by her
manner of pronouncing the name, for the answer that was
to follow.
“ Fridszin is my lover,” said she; “ my husband soon,
- if I can accomplish, in safety, the long and terrible
journey before me. We are Zigeuner, 'celenza, — that
much you know already. There are many such in the
country where I saw the light. The Hungarians of the
Krapaks call us Tsigany, -- and give us a name at least,
though they allow us neither hearthstone nor rooftree! -
The hut in which I was born at Bröny, is an excavation
in the sand-cliffs, near Kremnitz, - part of a large settle-
ment, one of the largest in Hungary, — and favoured with

311
higher advantages; for our people are attached to the
Imperial mines.”
"And is Fridszin a miner? ” I inquired, eager to enjoy
again the melting intonation with which she had pro-
nounced the name she loved.
“He is not so favoured,” replied Franszetta. “To be a
labourer in the gold mines, you must be a born vassal of
some magnat. — Fridszin is a poor orphan lad, who works
in the Imperial glass-manufactory, at Bröny. We used to
play together when children; rolling and sporting together
in our tattered garments on the greensward, and sharing all
that is assigned by Providence to the enjoyment of all, —
- the blue skies, — the clear waters, — the fields, — the
flowers, — the summer weather; and as we progressed
into the cares and labours of life, our hearts grew together
into love, as branches of the same tree bear flowers at the
same moment. I loved him very dearly before I knew it;
and after I knew it, (for the moment he asked me the
question, I discovered my secret), I felt only the prouder
of loving one to whom I was so dear. I knew how to
value the happiness of being loved ; — for all spring and
summer, — (poor child of misery that I was! -) I was
forced away from home, to wander from fair to fair, and
town to town, with Grelotte and the ape; and I swear to
you, that my father cared no more for me, and tended me
no more than he did my two companions ; — nay, less ! —
for when the ape was sick, he was anxious, - saying the
beast was too delicate for the rude climate of Hungary;
whereas, when aught ailed me, I was left to grow well
again as I listed. Right glad was I, when poor Grelotte,
who had been reared with me, used to come and lie at my
feet of nights, and lick my hands at my waking. I weary
you, 'celenza ! - I want you to know why I so love
Fridszin. I want you to know that, during those dreary
nights and comfortless days, it was my solace to think that
my poor mother was not lonely during my absence, but
that Fridszin laboured to make her life easier ; always in
and out of the hovel, — devoting his leisure hours to work
for her, and be unto her as a son.”

“For which good deed, a grateful daughter plighted her
faith to him in return !”.
“Would you have had me regardless of his devotion —
his, — the kindest and truest of human beings ! — Yet, my
father hated me for what he called my poorness of spirit;
Fridszin being but a poor friendless boy; while 1, he said,
possessed means of acquiring riches for myself and those
belonging to me. So much the better, I thought, whenever
I thought of Fridszin ! — But what was worse than hating
me, my father used to revile my mother for having sanc-
tioned our affection; and so, the older I grew, the wider
was the breach between me and him who had the privilege
of inflicting punishment upon me, heavier than I could
bear. It was all this,” continued Franszetta, in a more
resolute tone, “ that made a woman of me! - I am but a
child,” said she, suddenly extending towards me her slight
delicate hand and arm; “ you perceive that this is the
limb of a child, — yet, I have the heart and soul of a
Jioness!”-
“ The ferocity of one ! ” cried I, laughing. “Children
do not stab, my pretty Franszetta. Children do not swim
a canal, in the dead of night, — or clamber up through the
window of a Venetian palace —”
“ Into a young man's bed-room. - Say it out!” con-
tinued Franszetta, coolly. “What I have courage to do,
I have courage to hear repeated ; and my conscience is so
clear on both points, - I have so little fear either of myself
or you, that I give you leave to say your worst. A kinder
thing were to curb your mocking humour, and listen. —
For the night advances, 'celenza ! — Perhaps you want to
sleep ? "
I assured her I had not the least disposition to close my
eyes ; but was careful to avoid irritating the wayward
creature by a single expression of kindness.
“This is the first time,” said Franszetta, suddenly start-
ing up from her cushion, and gazing round her with wonder
and delight, “ that I was ever in the sleeping room of a
palazzo! I have been called into courtly halls at Pesth,
at Presburg, at Trieste, at a hundred places, — to amuse
the poor, listless, gaping nobles, with my feats of activity;

313
and to judge by their rapture at my tumbling, or the antics
of Grelotte and the ape, they must lead a dreary life ! -
But beyond their fine clothes, and menials in gaudy suits,
or the pieces they flung me in payment, — what knew I of
their ways ? Nothing in their cold, colourless existence
tempted me. If such be the dreariness of the rich, God
keep me poor !'
The language in which Franszetta con veved these ideas,
was of far higher tone than all this common-place. But
I was absorbed in the contemplation of something more
picturesque than her language ; namely, her buoyancy of
figure and elasticity of step, as she flitted round the apart-
ment, verifying by her touch the nature of the objects it
contained, — the hangings, the tapestry, the books, the
various glittering objects scattered upon the toilet-table.
But no sooner did she find herself opposite the large swing-
glass, to which I have before adverted, than her delight
became ecstatic. It was probably the first time she had
seen the full reflection of her own fair person; for she
stood there a moment, transfixed, then broke into gestures
and attitudes, each of which might have served Canova as
a study for a new Ballerina. I never beheld anything
more remarkable than her power of compressing her pliant
form, cowering, as it were, into a ball; then, suddenly
recovering her grace and vivacity, assuming a succession of
postures stolen from some yet undiscovered treasury of
nature.
She seemed to lose all thought and recollection of me,
or where she was, or what had brought her there ; and
give herself up to the enjoyment of her calling, and ad-
miration of her own feats and graces, of which she was
for the first time an eye-witness. There she stood, —
sometimes poised on the point of a single foot, her delicate
wbite arms tossed gracefully above her head, in a pose that
a Bayadere might have envied ; the light of the fire shining
fitfully upon her figure and its reflection in the mirror, so
as to impart to both an appearance equally unreal; — and
there I lay, - my breath suspended, — wondering whether
the whole scene were not the fantastic coinage of a dream,
and satisfied that by attempting to ascertain its reality, I

should drive the reckless Franszetta to some desperate act.
All I had to do was to wait the issue as she chose to con-
struct it.
The stiletto was in her hand ; and she seemed to take
especial delight, as she brandished it in the rapid move-
ments of a sort of national military dance, to watch the
flashing light caused by the reflection of the fire upon its
blade, and the blade upon the mirror. After all, there was
more of the child than the woman in her antics and per-
ceptions. She could not have numbered more than sixteen
years. In wilfulness only was she a woman.
At length, panting and exhausted, she flew back to the
bed-side, -flung herself on the cushion, and threw back
her head to rest upon the coverlet; so as to afford me a
full view of her laughing face, brightened by exercise, and
excited by the triumphs of her skill out of all recollection
of her sorrows.
“ How warm it is here, -- how soft, — how tranquil,
- how bright, — how happy!” cried she, as if pursuing
her previous train of reflections. “ How different from the
biting air of the Canal Reggio last night, — how different
from the smoky cavern of our home at Bröny!”
“But were such a residence at this your own, Liebchen,"
said I, “ you would scarcely find amusements in tumbling
and pirouetting all night, when reasonable people are in bed
and asleep ?”
“ Perhaps not,” she replied, with quiet self-possession ;
“ for then I should be a dama, - living here with my
lord ;- not the affianced wife of Fridszin the Zigeun, and
sworn upon my mother's dying bed to be a faithful one.
My poor mother ! ” she exclaimed, the expression of her
mutable countenance changing in a moment. “Oh! if
you knew how precious her memory is and ought to be
to me! I told you before, 'celenza, that she was murdered !
The monster from whom you rescued me last night, felled
her to the ground with an axe, as she was pursuing her
household labours by her own hearth-side, merely because
she insisted on keeping me with her now that I was a
woman grown, instead of seeing me dragged from fair to
fair, and shown for hire, within hearing of things to which

no woman's ear should hearken, and exposed to perils more
fatal to woman's happiness than steel, or wave, or cold, or
hunger. He killed her, 'celenza. I saw her fall! I bore
her poor body to the miserable bed, where I and my little
brothers had been born to her ; - miserable bed, — where
she had shed her bitter tears in silence when I was absent,
and where sleep was vouchsafed her only because those
who labour hard from sunrise to nightfall, must find rest
at last. There she lay, — writhing like a crushed snake,
- her life-blood ebbing away; - my little brothers kneel-
ing at a distance on the floor, — not daring to approach,
lest they should be wet with her blood; — nor to hasten
to the factory after Fridszin, as I bad them, lest they
should encounter by the way the desperate man, who, after
murdering his patient, humble wife, rushed out into the
darkness, in a mood to kill and slay for very madness!
“ I saw her die, 'celenza, — die slowly and in torment;
– for how could I assuage her sufferings — 1, a poor ig-
norant girl of fifteen! Shall I tell you what she said to
me, during the two miserable hours I hung over her?”
“ Not if the recital distress you thus, Franszetta," said
I, perceiving, as I took her hand in mine, that it was cold
as death; while on her smooth forehead were rising dews
of profound emotion.
« She said that her life had been a life of bitterness, –
of blows, — of toil, - of want, — of woe, — that no sun-
shine had shone upon her, save from the faces of her
children. But that now she was going to her Maker, — to
her exceeding great reward ! 'My comfort on this cruel
death-bed,' said she,"is, that my soul is pure from stain,
- that amid all my trouble, all my weariness, vice never
found a crevice to enter my dwelling. Wherefore I know
that I shall rejoin my mother and my God, in a land where
there are no tears, — no trials !' And then, 'celenza, ---
then, - as I tried to stanch the blood welling from her
wounded throat, she uttered charges to me, too sacred to
be breathed by any voice in any ear, save by a mother to
her daughter ; and bestowed upon me her dying blessing,
and the stiletto which her dying mother had, with the like
benediction, bestowed upon herself, — an eastern relique of

our tribe, who, they say, are from the land of the Saviour.
Only a minute before she died, she bade me be an honest
wife to Fridszin, as she had been to him who was sending
her to her grave, if I had hope to meet her in heaven
with the love and trust we had shared together on earth !
And when I leant down, 'celenza, to kiss her poor lips, in
token of my solemn pledge in life and death to obey her,
- the breath was gone from them! I had no longer a
mother, --- only the holy commandment she had given me,
and the poor, bruised, bleeding body, which had sacrificed
all to keep me spotless with a spotlessness like hers. Oh!
surely - surely — the angels of God must have taken to
their charge so bright, so true a soul !
“And now,” cried Franszetta, starting up, after a pause
of deep emotion, during which her thoughts appeared to
be absorbed in inward prayer, and, standing erect upon
the floor, with her arms crossed over her panting bosom,
and her brows wearing an expression of mingled anguish
and intelligence impossible to describe, -" and now,
'celenza, tell me whether, with this poniard in my hand,
— this heart in my bosom, — I have aught to fear from
being alone in your chamber at midnight?”.
“ Nothing. Compose yourself !” said I, awed by per-
ceiving the veins upon her temples swollen with emotion,
and her whole frame tremulous, as with the passion of a
Pythoness. “ Sit down again, Franszetta, and tell me
gently what has since betided you, and what are your
projects.”
“ It was spring-time when all this chanced,” said the
girl, her voice sinking again into a desponding murmur;
“ for I remember that when I went my way at day-break
to the high bailiff's at Bröny, to call upon the authorities
to bury the dead and deal the rigour of the laws upon the
murderer,- as I hurried along the green turf bordering the
road, I trod upon the first primroses of the year. I saw
their pale stars even through my tears; and so long as I
live, and so dearly as I love the spring, shall never look
with pleasure upon those flowers again!
"'Celenza ! they buried their dead — but they dealt no
justice on the living! None had seen the blow. Even I

317
and my little brothers knew only that we had found our
mother bleeding on her hearthstone, — the door of the hut
open, — all in disorder. That to which I bore witness, as
having heard from her lips, they rejected; for the laws of
Hungary discountenance so monstrous an act as for a child
to swear away the life of a parent. But such laws never
contemplated the existence of a father like mine! And so,
as it mattered little to the bailiwick whether there were a
Zigeuner woman or child the more or less in the world,
saving so far as they were troubled with their correction,
the tribunal admonished me to go home with my father,
and study to be a dutiful daughter to him in his bereave-
ment! A dutiful daughter to him!”
Would I could convey an idea of the thrill of horror
and despair expressed by the gestures of Franszetta, as she
seemed to contemplate anew the terrors of such a sentence.
I could almost fancy I was returning with her into the
desolate hut, from which the body of her mother had been
removed.
“I obeyed — I had no choice. — I went home, though
she was no longer there !” — murmured the poor girl, —
making no effort to repress the tears that fell in heavy
drops upon her bosom, as she reseated herself by the bed-
side. “ There was no kind voice to soothe me — no
fondling hand to comfort me — only the two boys crying
beside the cold ashes on the hearth! But there, even
there, was the trace of — oh! God!— my poor, poor
mother!”
Half stifled by her suffocating sobs, a grievous pause
ensued. At length I took courage to inquire of Franszetta
whether her father had ventured, at such a moment, to
renew his violence ?
“ He dared not !” cried the girl ; “ for he knew that
the eye of authority was upon him, and that the neighbours
were resolved, on any act of cruelty against us, to inflict
summary punishment upon him. Besides, his bread de-
pended on my skill or his own labour ; - and he loved his
ease as he loved the raki flask. So on our return home,
'celenza, he spoke me fair; and, laying all that had chanced
to the score of drink and passion, swore that, if I would

pursue my calling as a tumbler only another year, he would
place the boys in the school of the baili wick during our
absence from Bröny, and at the end of my apprenticeship,
grant me half my gains, by way of dowry.".
“ And Fridszin,” said I, interrupting her; “ did he
accede to this proposal, instead of claiming you as a
wife?”
“ Alas! 'celenza, on the very eve of my poor mother's
death, he was sent off by the commissioners to Vienna,
with a cargo from the imperial factory, under escort; —
and was not to be back till summer. He had been chosen
at a minute's warning by the director, as trustworthiest of
the workmen ; with the choice of forfeiting his place, or
departing without a word of farewell.”
Poor fellow, - poor Franszetta !”.
“ Even had he been there, what could he have done? -
I was a minor, — my father's bondswoman; — and was it
likely he would consent to lose me by a marriage with a
penniless workman when so great was my renown, that the
Leopstadt theatre had bidden money for me, to figure in
one of their magic stage-plays : From ten years old I had
been exhibiting all the summer months at Raab, Presburg,
Ofen, and elsewhere. My father's business was to frequent
fairs with his dulcimer, and Grelotte, and the ape, showing
conjuring tricks, and mending stringed instruments; and
so long as they were only three, their gains were so small,
that he often said he would almost as soon work in the
mines or turn the plough, as my mother was ever entreat-
ing. But from the moment he thought of carrying me
with him to display the feats of activity he had taught me
as a pastime for winter nights, his copper earnings became
silver ; and he was in hopes,— more than in hopes, — that
as I grew older and stronger, the silver might turn to gold.
You know not all I can do, 'celenza, when the blood is not
stagnant in my veins with cold, as it was last night on the
Piazza, or my muscles unstrung with hunger ; — nay, I
know not myself. There is a spirit within me that some-
times carries me, as it were, into the air: and the flower
could no more give you a reason why it blows than I how
I conjure up the postures that bring down the plaudits of

319
the standers-by. They come to me, as my life came, by
the will of heaven.”
“ But since you are thus successful, Franszetta," said I
-“whence the abject poverty you complain of ?”.
“ Because, after passing the day in the square of some
great city, — a show to the people till it shames me to
know myself a woman, and soon to be a wife, — at night,
the bag of money I have worked so hard for is melted
away at the wine-house! Not a tratteria in Trieste or
Venice in which that man has not squandered his means,
while I was famishing in our wretched lodgings! Yester-
day, you heard me refuse to dance after dark, because, the
night before, when I had been breaking my very heart-
strings to tumble for the sailors of the Zecca, the heavy bag
of silver I had collected never so much as entered our
dwelling! Dice and drink emptied it before morning!”
“ You are right ! - Such a father has forfeited all claim
over you !” cried I. “ But how, my poor girl, — how are
you to escape from Venice without his knowledge ?”.
" How did I escape from the guardhouse last night
without that of the bombadier — how arrive in your
chamber without alarming your servants? Think you
that Nature has endowed me with such force of muscle
and agility of limh, without suggesting them as a means
of defence ? You, a noble, and bred in enervation and
luxury, cannot dream the strength of arm and heart and
soul, of one of the people. You know not of what I am
capable !”
“ You are a little mirable of moral courage, as of strength
and feeling !” cried I, with a sentiment of profound sym-
pathy. - But.so young ---- so unprotected.”
The smile on Franszetta's lip displayed mingled arch-
ness and bitterness. “ Strive and thrive!” cried she.
“ Nothing was ever achieved by moaning. In these Ve-
netian weeds, 'celenza, who will recognise Franszetta the
dancing girl ? Did you know me at first, when I sat shi-
vering here by your bedside ? — I have flung aside those
villanous spangled slippers and velvet jerkin, for good and
all! I would not so much as part with them to the sales.

into the canal on my way hither. If words of mine could
only say how I abhorred them! - Never shall I forget
my sense of loathing when my father took them out of the
chest into which they had been thrust at the time of my
poor mother's death ; and I saw that, from some of the
rags thrown in with them, they had contracted stains of
blood !”
" And when do you expect to reach Bröny?” said I,
willing to change the current of her thoughts.
" When God pleases !” replied Franszetta. “ He per-
mitted my poor mother to be slain in her innocence. It
is not always prayer or virtue that obtains the protection
of Heaven. But that good mother is now among the
angels, — and I feel that she will plead for me, and that
it will go well with her child.”
“And when you arrive at home, you will become the
wife of Fridszin?”
“ If he consent himself to resign all for my sake, and
flee the country. For it would be death for me to await
there my father's return. Nay, Fridszin must do more!
He must carry off my little brothers with us ; for not for
my life's sake would I leave my mother's sons at the mercy
of that man.”
“ But since your labour will scarcely enable you to sup-
port yourselves ?”
• Providence is over all ! - If we are in need, a burthen
is the lighter borne, the more there are to bear it.”
“At least, Franzetta, you will not deny me my share
in the good work. I owe you some compensation for the
bitter plunge into the Canal Reggio, to which I condemned
you last night."
“You fancy then that I had to swim for it? Did it never
occur to you, that the old Gallician sergeant could be
moved to mercy as well as yourself? Do you hold with
my country people that Német ember, nem ember ?'
Must you be the only christian in the world ?” And the
saucy girl clasped her hands over her fazziolo, and laughed
till her white teeth became visible, at my look of stupefac-
tion ; in this, as in every other mood and guise, displaying
the mutability of a playful child.

Not, however, to dwell too lengthily on perfections that
must have been seen to be appreciated in their rapid
changes, suffice it that my contributions towards her tra-
velling-purse were as liberal as my means allowed. Luckily
perhaps for my prudence, my treasury was chiefly stored
with Hammersley's notes ; to Franszetta, about as available
as the bill of my day's dinner at the Pellegrino. But in
addition to some twenty ducats, I forced upon her accep-
tance two rings of price, (one of them the gift of my sister
Julia,) to which she could have recourse on an evil day.
All this it was an easy matter to deposit in a little leathern
bag which she wore within her girdle, already stored with
a few gold coins-gifts, on various occasions, from magnats
and noble ladies, before whom she had exhibited her feats.
“I accept your goodness without scruple, 'celenza,"
said she, “ for I see that you are rich, as well as gene-
rous.” She had been surveying with wonder and delight
the ornaments of crystal and gold displayed on my toilet.
“ You have scattered benefits upon me out of your abun-
dance, nor have they fallen on an ungrateful soil! I shall
bless you on my desolate journey ; I shall bless you when
I reach my miserable home; I shall bless you when I fold
my little brothers in my arms; I shall bless you when I
am folded in those of Fridszin; I shall bless you in my
prayers, when I kneel upon my mother's grave! I know
not your name I know not your country. You have a
language which is neither that of Italy, nor Germany, nor
Hungary ; but your heart seems to inherit from the same
fatherland as mine; and that it is which makes me speak
to you so freely, without fear of your greatness, without
fear of your riches, without fear even of your youth and
gallantry. When you appeared so suddenly yesterday on
the Piazza, a stranger in Venice, and speaking the lan-
guage as imperfectly as myself, I hailed you as a protector
sent by God and my mother to my defence! There was
something so noble in your air, so kindly in your voice,
something I seemed to recognise as though heard and seen
a thousand times before! Do you suppose, 'celenza, there
are no brothers and sisters in the world, save children of

the same parents? Do you imagine that there is not more
sympathy of nature betwixt you and me, than betwixt me
and the father who beats me with stripes, and would glory
in seeing me brought to shame?”
“I am thankful to you, pretty Franszetta," I replied,
“ for adopting me as a brother. But thus far it is a bro-
ther's duty to warn you : that you will gain little credit in
the eyes of men from having passed the night in my cham-
ber: and that when discovered here in the morning,"
“What care have such as I for credit in the eyes of
men?"-interrupted Franszetta, with something of her
wild recklessness of the preceding night. “ Think you
that a mummer of the market-place can be curious in
matters of fair renown, like your nobil dama, who goes to
the ball of the Cavalchina with her gallant, and fancies
that, because masqued from her equals, she is hidden from
the eye of Heaven? No, no! The eyes of my mother,
and of Him with whom she abideth for evermore, know
that I have done no wrong; that were I to die this night,
my soul would depart from me pure as when it struggled
into this world of care! As for being discovered here-
but no matter! Sleep in peace, 'celenza. You are weary.
The embers burn low. The night draws out. Sleep in
peace! I will watch beside you ; and when morning
approaches wake you, that you may let me forth before
your people are astir. Sleep, while my benedictions
sanctify your rest! Nay, I will sing you to slumber, as
I used my young brothers, when they were restless."
In my desire to hear her lullaby, I pretended to comply
with her proposition ; and promising myself to remain wide
awake, laid down my head upon my pillow, while Frans-
zetta commenced in her own language a doleful chaunt,
like the gradual swelling of the wind on an autumnal
evening. Never did I hear anything so wild, so mournful.
It seemed to bring before one the fluttering down of wi.
thered leaves, and the gathering shadows of night. I
tried hard to adapt English words to the rhythm, with a
view of describing it on the morrow to Byron, and the
following stanzas were the result of the attempt:-

CHAUNT.
Rest to thy pillow,- rest, -
I watch beside thee; -
No care shall wring thy breast;
No ill betide thee ! -
Love guards thy pillow. - LOVE, -
The unrepining! -
Heaven's moon is bright above,
Heaven's stars are shining ! -
Peace, - peace, - forget,- forgive,-
And be forgiven ;-
That all who love and live,
May wake in heaven !-
Dream of thy dear ones, - dream!
The past retracing,
Thy native valley's stream,
Thy love's embracing;
No sound shall mar thy sleep,
No fears perplex thee;-
Angels their vigils keep, -
Thy God protects thee!--
Peace, - peace, - forget, - forgive,
And be forgiven ;
That all who love and live
May wake in Heaven -
While gathering in the sounds of a dirge as sad as a
Highland coronach, all seemed suddenly to cease; and
Berto was calling upon me to rise, and talking about shav-
ing-water, when I opened my eyes again.— I started up.
- I looked on the footstool.- I gazed round the room, into
which the sparkling rays of a winter morning were pouring
their brightness.-I tore open the heavy curtains intervening
between my bed and the wall. — Not a vestige of my mid-
night visitant!-
“Why did you let her out before you woke me?”-
cried 1, addressing my attendant, in utter consternation ;
whereupon Berto, who, from my precipitate movements,
evidently thought me possessed, presumed to suggest that I
was still asleep, or at least still dreaming.
“But the girl!” cried I; — “the girl who was sitting
her beside me when you entered ? ”-
“No one was sitting here, Eccelenza !” he replied, look-
ing somewhat demure at such a supposition. “ All was
closed as usual. I entered the room with my pass-key.
Now I think of it, the curtains of yonder window were
undrawn, and the blinds half open, though I remember well

that all was safe when I left you last night. I suppose
your Excellency unfastened them.”
And again he began to talk about shaving-water.
I was half out of my wits ! —Was it in the possibility of
things that the event of the night had been an illusion,
that I had dreamed of Franszetta's visit, - of her strange
history ? - If so, would that I could have slept for ever, to
retain before my eyes the graceful froward being fluttering
before my glass, like some sylph new lighted on a flower!-
Rising in haste, I examined the dressing-case, which we
had seemed to open together the preceding night. The
ducats were gone,—the rings were gone,—but nothing else.
-Though on the toilet-table lay scattered numberless loose
object of value, gifts from those towards whom I would
not be guilty of the perfidy of bestowing them on another,
not the smallest of them was missing! In her mysterious
flight, the gipsy girl had taken with her only what was
legitimately her own.
It would not amuse my readers to hear recited the oaths
I bestowed on my own somnolency, or upon Berto's awk-
wardness all the time he was ministering to my toilet, —
oaths which would have driven O'Brien out of his senses.-
I felt convinced I should never behold that bewitching
creature again. I had known, from the first, that she
must go at sunrise ; but I had a few more kindly words to
whisper to her. I wished to establish some future medium
of communication between us, in case disaster should over-
take her ; in case, for instance, that on her return to
Bröny, Fridszin should not have arrived, or should be un-
willing to fulfil his contract.-Ass that I was to fall asleep,
because a beautiful girl was singing me to rest !-.
I resolved not to say a syllable on the subject to Byron.
I had not courage for the railleries he would launch like a
shower of arrows at my head. I dressed myself in haste.
It was, at least, some comfort that the wind was directly
contrary for Fiume. The frost was severe.—What rub-
bish one talks in England about the genial skies of Italy !--
Out of the Two Sicilies, where is the winter less tedious,
or less searching, than our own ?-
I had promised Byron to accompany him that day to the

Convent of St. Lazarus, where, between the pauses of a
dissolute life, he was pursuing his studies in the Armenian
language ; by way, he said, of a “rock to break his mind
upon.” Hitherto, I had declined the honour of a morning
in this synod of learned Pundits, among whom I should be
thoroughly out of place.
I abominate monasteries. Two things peculiar to the
cloister, are my especial detestation : the smell of human
fustiness,—and the aspect of human hypocrisy. The faces
one sees in such places, are as much made up in their way
as that of : petite maitresse. Rouge and patches are not the
only for gn aids of ornament by which people falsify their
visages. Humility, piety, patience, may sit just as discord-
antly upon the countenance, as white lead or painted eye-
brows ! --The soft deprecating voice of an old monk is my
ideal of the accents of Satan.
Byron was partial to these Armenian fellows. He, and
Lady Morgan, and most other enlightened English who
have loitered beside the Rialto, have done their best to
recommend the learned recluses of San Lazaro to the favour
of the world. With all my affection for B., I could not
fully enter into his predilections !—That cursed bleak ride
on the Lido,— the convent in question,- and the linen-
draper's wife and family, seemed to me far less inviting
than a Pellegrino dinner, or our box at the Fenice.
We breakfasted together, and proceeded to his gondola.
Tita was in attendance ; — the morning bright. — But my
spirits did not respond to the cheerfulness of the hour.
Byron was full of mirth. If Father Pasquali, the learned
friar to whom he was hastening, could have overheard the
confidences of his noble pupil concerning his Opera adven-
tures of the night before, he had probably been of opinion
that Byron was quite right to select so severe and sobering
an investiture for his faculties, as the intricacies of an
Armenian grammar.
Previous to repairing to the convent, we were to leave a
letter of recommendation I had received from my brother
for Count Mocenigo; and as we were entering the grand
canal, the slackened pace of the gondola attested that some-
thing unusual was occurring. Byron swore it was only
y 3

some raft or fruit-barge,- and called to Tita to push on;
- an invitation which procured for us the explanation,
that they were taking the body of a young girl out of the
water.
“ Dead?”- said I, with some interest, - looking forth
towards the crowd of gondolas, clustered round the spot.
“ Impossible to say, Eccelenza," was Tita’s reply. “See :
- they have placed her on the steps of the Mocenigo pa-
lace. — They are feeling her hands. — They shake their
heads.-Corpo di Diana !—'Tis all over with her!”
“It is a poor peasant girl,” said Byron, to gratify whose
curiosity, rather than mine, Tita pushed towards the spot,
—“and beautiful as an angel !-"
At this declaration I looked again. Two gondoliers were
at that moment bearing down the body, to place it in a
boat for removal, - one of them, an old grey-headed man,
- the other young and powerful, whose arms were encir-
cling the feet. Both were so placed, with regard to us,
that I saw only the face of the old man, and the stalwart
form of the young one ; and the same idea, at that moment
struck both Byron and myself. What a realisation of the
famous picture of the interment in Atala. There was Chactas,
—there the dead virgin they were bearing away to the grave.
In another moment a cry burst out of the depths of my
heart, which suspended the observations of my companion.
The sun was upon that mournful group, and a sudden turn
of the bearers brought the face of the dead full under its
brightness. The reader has forestalled the fatal truth.
That cold, white face, — that raven hair, from which the
chilly waters were dripping as they bore her along,—those
delicate and slender limbs — were those of Franszetta!
We followed the boat to the Ospidaletto, to which it was
destined. We saw the best efforts of art directed towards
her resuscitation. In vain! There were severe bruises,
- there were traces of outrage. The belt containing the
money had been torn away, — the stiletto was not in her
girdle. She had not, as I had first supposed, fallen into
the water in escaping from the Palazzo Gritti. She had
shared the fate of her mother. The girl was murdered !
Could anything have increased my affection for Byron,

it would have been the more than brotherly manner in
which he entered into my affliction, assisted me in at-
tempting to stimulate the investigations instituted by the
criminal tribunals, and joined with me in yielding such
poor tokens as the occasion permitted, of respect to the
memory of the dead.
Foor Franszetta, —poor high-minded Tsigány! Little
didst thou suppose, amidst the girlish drudgery of thy
wretched hovel at Bröny, that the noble poet of England,
the man whose name was European, would attend as a
mourner at thy obsequies ! It was Byron who suggested 7
an inscription for the stone I placed over her remains, -
copied from some tomb he had seen at Ferrara : -
FRANSZETTA IMPLORA Eterna quiete !
A long silken tress, shred from her head ere they placed
· her in her coffin, moist with the chilly waters of the La-
gune, is all that remains to me as a token of the reality of
that most strange adventure!
I never dwell upon the recollection of Franszetta, as a
child of clay. She lives in my memory as pure among the
pure, because uncorrupted among the corrupt; — an angel
with her mother, who is in heaven! Eheu! Franszetta !
CHAPTER III.
The grand Prior of Aviz, shrinking back in his chair, exclaimed piteously,
“I shall never be able to stand this; my eyes would become fountains, and we
have had weeping enough lately.” So saying, he retired without further
ceremony.

BYRON would not hear of my returning to my desolate
quarters at the Palazzo Gritti. He protested that no
human fortitude ought to be exposed to so gratuitous a
trial. But this arrangement only hastened my departure
from Venice. My consciousness of the inconvenience im-
posed upon him by my sojourn in his apartments in the
Spezieria, as well as of the restraint which any third person

must bring to a course of life like his, determined me to
expedite my departure from the city. Its familiar haunts
were now accursed in my sight. The Piazza, - the Zecca,
- the Canal Grande, — and above all, that haunted cham-
ber in the Palazzo Gritti, were full of Franszetta!- Strange
mortals that we are !-- The events of eight-and-forty
hours, — an acquaintanceship of two dreary winter days'
duration, — nay, of less, was fated to destroy my peace
of mind for many ensuing months, and endow me with
memories of sadness as enduring as my life.
. I succeeded in persuading Byron, that the most friendly
part he could play by me, was to assist in hastening my
journey; and before the middle of the month, was rowing
back again from San Giorgio towards Fusina, repeating
almost the same words I had uttered at Cintra, seven years
before, — that in all my wanderings, — all my pursuits, —,
misfortune was beforehand with me.
I was bound for Rome, –a city of the past, and con-
sequently a place of tribulation, - appropriate sojourn of
those who mourn, and refuse to be comforted! At first,
Byron insisted on bearing me company in my tour. But
he had previously pledged himself to Marianna, to remain
with her till the close of the carnival; and as I saw that
he was doing violence to his feelings and hers by this rup-
ture of his word, I promised to go no further than Florence,
till he was at liberty to rejoin me.
For three dreary months, therefore, I remained alone on
the Lung Arno, weary of myself and the world, and in-
tent only on my lost Pleiad. Unacquainted with a crea-
ture in the place, I pronounced it to be detestable. On
visiting Florence the following year, it seemed to me that
a transformation had taken place in every object, animate
or inanimate. But when I came to reflect, that on my
first visit I had frequented exclusively the thickets of
Boboli and the woods of the Cascini, consoling myself by
watching the progress of the budding spring, it was not
likely I should find much analogy between their feathered
choir and the orchestra of Lord Burghersh. Towards
the close of April, Byron rejoined me. At the beginning
of May, we stood together in the Coliseum.

Things fall out strangely in this imbroglio of cross
purposes. It had been one of the darling visions of
Byron's life to visit — no !- I'll be hanged if I call it the
Eternal City, even in print - to visit ROME. Foscolo,
Madame de Staël, Rogers, and a hundred other talkers to
whom the world delights to listen, had inspired him with
an eager interest in the memorable reliques of the antique
world ; - and now he was there, he allowed himself to
be ciceroned to all and everything that classical pilgrims
delight to worship. But his heart and soul were brimful
of the wife of a linendraper; and his chief care, with
St. Peter's on one side and the Pantheon on the other, was
to enable himself to return to Venice within a fortnight!
Yet such is the vivifying power of genius, that the
hurried visit of Byron, rushing from monument to monu-
ment, - flying through St. Peter's — glancing at the
Apollo, galloping from the Alban mount to Frascati,-
enabled him to add a brighter leaf to the garland of
" the Niobe of nations," than the be-laurelling of a whole
century of ordinary travellers, — bustling Botherbys, -
and maudlin Countesses of Pinchbeck.
What provoked me most in the pre-occupation of his
mind and frustration of my plans, was a fact of which
he was himself uncognizant, — that Marianna's influence
was declining, and that his devotion was a matter of con-
science. We are all sad hypocrites to each other, - even
those who pretend to live together open-hearted as brothers.
Byron affected to be as much in love, — and I, as much
in grief as ever; while in truth, he was growing sadly
ennuiéd with his living heroine, and I, beginning almost
to doubt the existence of my dead one. I often fancied
that I had only indulged in a dream of Franszetta. But
Byron was preserved from any mis-doubtings of that
description, by the bills of certain Shylocks of the Rialto,
for pearls, diamonds, opals, and rubies, which the lady
of his love not only accepted, but re-sold, as others have
since re-sold the more precious intellectual ores of his con-
fiding. - He insisted upon going to see three robbers
guillotined while he was in Rome, and about to return to
Marianna. Now Marianna was a robber!

There was no occasion for me to leave Rome, because
he happened to be hurrying back to Venice, in the
vicinity whereof he intended to hire a villa for the
summer months ; — La Mira, - since so celebrated. I
remained there longer than is customary for the English
to defy the malaria ; then went to Sorrento, and from
thence sailed for Messina. Sicily was as much the idol of
my dreams as Rome of Byron's ;- a person, for whose
taste I have the highest reverence, having inspired me
with deep interest in its classical remains and modern
enchantments, — its climate, mild as the sighs of beauty,
its gentle landscapes, —- its meads, - its valleys, - its
Enna, - its Hybla.
Now I have infinite satisfaction in gentle landscapes,
meads, and valleys, provided they lie within reach of a city
where the cuisine is good and the opera tolerable. I knew
that in the granary of Italy, corn, wine, and oil were in
abundance, and that fruit, which signified more during the
dog-days, — that fruit might be had for the picking! -
Any man can live on figs and water-melons under the
clear blue skies of Sicily. It is only when sinking under
the ponderosities of fog and soot, that one cries aloud for
the flesh of oxen and the flesh of South-downs, to enable
us to bear up against the climate. A haunch of venison
would be as uninviting at Palermo in the month of July,
as sorbets and pastecchi at Edinburgh in that of January.
The island, which seems to form a stepping-stone from
Africa to Europe, — turning, like some ripe fruit, one
sunburnt check to the south, and one still immature
towards the north, — did not disappoint my expectations.
I spent the winter at Palermo. When I returned to
Naples, everybody asked me what on earth I had found to
detain me there. I told them it was the climate. I shall
give the same answer to such of my readers as are bold
enough to put the same question. It does not suit me to
be more explicit. If any one has any fault to find with my
reserve, my card of address lies at my publisher's.
One of the cleverest writers and best-hearted men of my
acquaintance, D’Israeli, the younger, once on a time wrote
to me - “ Youth is a blunder, - manhood a struggle, -

old age a regret,” – a dictum worth reading, in a letter
worth preserving. My youth, heaven knows, was a
blunder,-my manhood a struggle ; and now that I am
arriving at old age, (for half a century of coxcombry
counts for half as much again as a life of mere vegetation,)
the past is beginning to get the better of the future in my
affections.
One of the places I most regret, is Sicily ; — and certain
of those dearest to my recollections, are Palermans. The
spot is not sanctified like Cintra or Venice, by a grave;-
but my reminiscences are only the more mournful. For
with Emily and Franszetta abides an atmosphere of per-
petual spring, - eternal youth, — unchanging beauty;
while in Sicily, time has wrought the same cruel triumphs
as over myself. The face which was beautiful as an
angel's, two-and-twenty years ago, is now that of a mere
mortal; and though “ John Anderson, my jo John,” may
be a pleasing ditty to sing beside one's ain ingle, with one's
ain auld wife, a superannuated Romeo and Juliet sighing
to each other in their grand climacteric, like two venerable
turtle-doves croaking their fondness, presents to my mind
anything but an attractive picture.
Mutat enim mundi naturam totius ætas,
Ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;
Nec manet ulla sui similis res ; omnia migrant,
Omnia commutat natura et vertere cogit ! -
I pass over my adventures the following season at
Florence. They are recorded in many a diary, still kept
under golden lock and key, and brought out by their lovely
inditers on rainy Sunday afternoons, at their country seats ;
and to give publicity to them in the teeth of their breathing
heroines, were perfidy. Besides, Doctors' Commons might
prove a bitterer critic than even the Quarterly Review.
Suffice it, that it was in pursuance of one of these
Florentine episodes, I determined to return to England.
One of my angels exacted a promise of me to that effect;
and though I assured her, (and the event justified my pre-
diction) that once established among the proprieties of
English life and the surveillance of family connection, she
would be the first to forbid me the house, I felt it a point
of conscience to comply.

Another of my prophesies was just as strictly fulfilled.
I foresaw that I should abhor London, - its want of gra-
ciousness, - its want of cordiality,— its want of refine-
ment. I dreaded the supercilious faces of its fine world,
- the petty sarcasms which it fancies into wit, and its
abject fear of committing itself in the eyes of the censor-
ship of fashion. All this turned out as I expected. I
looked upon the London exclusives, just as the London
exclusives look upon those of New York. Considerable
changes and metamorphoses, however, struck me in the
L aspect of the great Babylon.
A certain classical commentator belauds the memory of
a certain Emperor, on the grounds that he found Rome
clay and left it marble. I had left London, brick, and
found it, - STUCCO.— This was a step in the march of
improvement, though niggling and crab-like. My friend,
Sir John Harris, one of the first to greet me on my return,
(being as stationary in the metropolis as the grasshopper
on the Exchange,) assured me that England had found in
Nash a new Vitruvius,- a Palladio the younger ; — and
though my first glimpse of the glories of Regent Street by
no means confirmed the decree, I accepted it with the
respect due to the Hephæstion of Carlton House.
I know not whether my ideas had expanded with much
travel ;- but I remember thinking, one night when we had
been playing the pageant of la bonne compagnie not exactly
at Carlton House, (which possessed the charm inseparable
from all royal establishments, of everything and every-
body being in its place,) but at the showy residence of a
satellite, who affected the form without the spirit of the
Carltonian circles, - I remember thinking, I say, that,
were Primrose Hill suddenly to send forth an eruption of
cinders and lava, to Herculaneanize or Pompeiify the
west-end of London, how greatly the year 3001 of the
Christian era would wonder at the vulgarity of our taste,
and the littleness of our productions !-- Scarcely a modern
mansion one should like to produce to posterity, as our
endeavour to vie with the solid houses of Elizabeth's time,
or the grander aspirations of Inigo Jones. — As to the
thousand nameless trinkets invented to amuse the great

babies of our enlightened times, our grand nephews will
probably decide that there wanted only an enamel rod for
lordly fustigation, to complete the play-box of the grown-up
nursery.-
With respect to the wider field of London society, and
what are called by courtesy the gaieties of the season, it
was still the reign of mobs and staircases ; - immoderately
crowded assemblies, where the total absence of entertain-
ment within, necessitated the getting up a row at the door,
to impart animation and variety to the pleasures of the
evening. An assembly where no carriage was smashed,
would have been scarce worth speaking of; while the
sacrifice of a fine blood horse, or a coachman or footman
carried off on a shutter to St. George's Hospital, conferred
real distinction. The greatest happiness of the greatest
number was the professed motto of all ball-givers, — a
defunct system, upon which may be recorded a verdict of
felo-de-se.
I never knew exactly what amended our ways in this
particular. People ascribe the improvement to the ex-
tension of London and its population ; and the consequent
impossibility of giving visiting lists to your porter, with
the sweeping clause of a general invitation. — But such a
change would have been progressive; whereas mob-assem-
blies went out with George the Fourth. An enormous
schism arose in society, at the epoch of the Reform Bill.
Parties ran desperately high ; - political, not fashionable
parties, which, on the contrary, fell fifty degrees. — The
Capulets and Montagues of the great world would scarcely
meet in the same room; and though, the moment the
great measure was carried, the effervescence subsided, and
Whigs and Tories, recollecting that, like sea and land,
there must ever exist a junction between them, re-amal-
gamated as usual.
But in the interim the revolution was accomplished !-
People had discovered the charm of small parties and
moderately crowded rooms. Even the insulting term
“ Exclusives," applied to those who were desirous, in
inviting their friends, to secure them from having their
ribs broken and their dresses torn from their backs, did

not avail to frighten the grande monde into a renewal of
the exploded system of the bear-garden.
I came to England straight from Florence, which was
then what Florence had never been since the days of the
Medici ; and will never be again, till so rare a combination
occurs, as for two English families, of high rank and dis-
tinguished accomplishments, to be equally agreeable in
their male and female representatives, -as was the case
with the Burghershes and Normanbys. Agreeable people
resident in a city attract agreeable people to remain there
as guests. Everything that was pleasant in the way of
man, woman, or child, was induced to pause, in passing
through Florence, by the charm of congenial society ; till
beauty, wit, and, above all, agrément, (a charm superior to
either,) became synonymous in Tuscany with the word
Inglese.
A coterie of this description, like most other earthly
enjoyments, is best appreciated by its loss. We rarely
understand the blessedness of a blessing, till called upon to
remember that
Such things were
That were most dear.
The dull circles of Florence, accordingly, date to this day
by the Normanby Hegira, though, at the moment, they
seemed to fancy that English plays, and French plays, and
Italian operas, were to be everlastingly represented for
their diversion, by those upon whose like they ne'er will
look again. -
Even I, though, Heaven knows, that winter was one of
the pleasantest of my life, scarcely estimated the charm
of those easy, pleasant, chatty soirées, till I found my Self
jammed into some black hole of a mob in Grosvenor Square,
where the conversation consisted in exclamations against
the heat, and of wonder whether it would be possible to
get the carriage.
London society flattered itself it was just then enjoying
a peculiar state of beatitude. The king had been just
crowned, -- the queen just buried, and the world enter-
tained a notion there would be a royal marriage, - a female

court, - everything the public eye and mind delights to
dwell on!
But it is not of King George I have undertaken to
write. — Kings have their historiographers, who are paid
for praising them; and it is without a salary I have
undertaken to commemorate the reign of Cecil Danby.
Having already hinted that my birth was the first event
of public note at Paris that followed the assembling of the
States General, my beloved public will be, of course, ill-
natured enough to recollect that, at the coronation of
George the Fourth, I must have numbered some two-and-
thirty years ! Nothing in which people take a more 16.! 789
malicious pleasure, than in convicting and publishing, the
ages of their fellow-creatures. Allude in company to the
natal date of some absent individual, and you will find
everybody endeavouring to prove him older than he ac-
knowledgeth. Every stranger is better informed on the
subject than peerage or parish register, mother, doctor, or
nurse.
I am not sure, now I come to think of it, that I did
not at the epoch in question affect to be one-and-thirty
instead of two. I was conscious that, henceforward, every
step must be downhill. I knew that to please a lady's
eye, thirty is the apex of human perfection, — the moment
when the mind begins to mellow, ere the body has begun
to decay. Thanks, however, to my mother's obstinate
adherence to the age of eight-and-forty, and certain errors
of date which she consequently took care should creep
into the peerage, I remained thirty, longer than most
men.
To my very great amazement I found that, as regarded
my popularity, age mattered not a jot.
It is needless, I hope, to repeat that the world contained
not a roof wide enough for Lord Ormington and myself
to dwell together in peace. Antipathy and vindictiveness
were strong as ever in our hearts; and I therefore estab-
lished myself in a little snuggery in Cleveland Row, to be
within umbrella reach of my Clubs, and at a sufficient
distance from Hanover Square.
I did not much like the idea of subsiding into “ a gen-

tleman in lodgings.” When I recalled to mind the cogent
advice lavished upon me by Lady Harriet Vandeleur on
my débút, ten years before, the extreme difficulty she
then seemed to anticipate for me of obtaining endurance
in society, when backed by Lady Ormington's influence,
Lord Ormington's cook and cellar, and my own more than
Grecian symmetry of face and form, I could not but per-
ceive the impossibility of making a sensation, now that I
stood alone, on means far from princely, with an occa-
sional line of silver perceptible among my glossy curls, and
an occasional line of care intersecting my manly brow;-
the only “ lines on a person of quality,” upon which the
coteries are apt to be critical.
“Never mind !” said I to my Self, — when I saw him
almost out of spirits on ascertaining a few of these par-
ticulars from the reflection of an ill-conditioned lodging-
house looking-glass, about the size and colour of a cat's
eye, -“Never mind, my dear fellow !—There is room for
everybody in the world, - as well as for every animal in
the ark. You have lost the pretension of astounding –
the mere vulgar appetite of boyhood ! — Henceforward,
you must charm by being agreeable. You were a deuced
popular fellow at Naples. You were much liked at Flo-
rence. London invariably accepts its favourites on the
strength of their foreign endorsement. It hissed Pasta,
till she had been half smothered by the bouquets of
La Scala. Be of good cheer, — it will not hiss you. —
Take courage — clear your throat — look the public in the
face ! — You will do very well in your way."
Upon this system of philosophy, — this new Soul-ar
System, — I prepared myself modestly to fill a secondary
place as a stop-gap in dinner parties, and a supernumerary
at balls. Judge therefore of my amazement on finding
myself super-ascendantly the fashion ; — neither a stop-
gap nor a supernumerary, — but enormously the fashion !
- I do not speak under correction ;-I say again, -
ENORMOUSLY the fashion ! -
I could scarcely make it out, — but so it was ! It was
not alone that I was invited by all the “ leaders of ton;"-
I was invited in a manner to make acceptance inevitable.

But what could these lovely creatures possibly want
with me? Cecil Danby, my dear fellow !--for a man of V
two-and-thirty, thou wert a sad ninny to find occasion for
the query !-- Did not the peerage set forth in its record of
the Barony of Ormington - Heir apparent -- the Hon.
John ;-and was it not a matter of notoriety, that the said
Hon. John was in infirm health, having issue by his
marriage only the Hon. Jane ? — Hadst thou not therefore
every reasonable prospect of succeeding to an ancient title,
with a rent-roll of thirty-five thousand pounds per annum,
and as much increase as the thrifty habits of Lord Orming-
ton might have amassed in addition? — Was not such, in
fact, the express origin of his lordship’s still increasing
aversion to thy Self ?
Yes ! — such is the extraordinary foresight of that
shrewdest of all insects, except the ant, — a London cha-
peron, that I was actually booked among the partis ! As
if it were not vile enough to speculate upon the Duke of
This or Viscount That, in possession of his dukedom or
his viscountcy, the manœuvering mammas of the beau
monde look into futurity with the eye of a seer or an insu-
rance broker! Were I an earl, with a marriageable elder
son and the consciousness of impaired health, I should
determine the progress of my decay less by consultations
of physicians, than by examining the nature and quality
of the notes addressed to my heir-apparent. If I saw the
young gentleman placed at table by Lady Winstanley next
to one of her daughters, for instance, I would go home
and order my coffin.
I was placed there. I was invited to her ladyship’s
pleasant house in Curzon Street, whenever I liked to
“ drop in.” I was pressed to join Richmond parties with
them. I was asked to her dinners, both family and
formal.
But it was not alone Lady Winstanley whose civilities
convinced me that Danby was in a critical condition.
Three or four more of the most experienced chaperons
were on the watch to bag me, if I only put out my nose.

rounds, like an earth-stopper, or the parish mole-catcher,

or any other setter of springes, without thinking of the print
which adorned the Aldine edition of one of our nursery
classics in Hanover Square ; representing that Mazarin of
the fairy tale book, Puss in Boots, in a feigned sleep upon
the ground, with his half-open bag baited with parsley,
lying on the ground by his side, to catch the foolish rabbits
who might stray into his toils.
My own feelings and views on the question matri-
monial, are expressed in the following skit, penned one
evening after listening to the everlasting chirp of a cricket
that haunted my apartment in Cleveland Row.
THE PHILOSOPHY OF GRYLLO.
CRICKET ! who, these three months long,
Hast beset me with thy song,
Ever restless,- never ranging,-
In thy notes and haunts unchanging,
Chirping still from noon till night,
Say 1- What makes thy heart so light ?
Midst the cursed frost and fog
Rendering man so dull a dog,
Prithee, GRYLLO, -whisper me
Thy resource against Ennui ?
GRUMBLER!-quoth the Cricket, -thou -
Sauntering home with aching brow,
Sallow cheeks, and yawns amazing
From the halls whose lights are blazing,
Scents exhaling, -garlands wreathing, -
Music's tones voluptuous breathing,
Jullien, Strauss, and Collinet,-
Gunter and the devil to pay,
Beauty drest by Madame Devy,-
Say! - what makes thy heart so heavy ?-
CRICKET ! - In those scenes of sport,
Crockey's,-coterie,- or court,
Hustings, tableaux, or charades,
Steeple-chases, tennis, cards,-
Riding twenty miles to cover,
Skulking back to play the lover,
Moonlight, cloisters, and romancing,
Waltzing, reeling, country-dancing,
Dicing, drinking, racing, flirting,
What is it seems so diverting ?
GRUMBLER !-in my chimney-corner,
Free from bore and safe from scorner,
Blest with ménage snug and cozy,
All the joys of life sub rosa ;
Carlotta Grisi twirls in vain,
I've not a pound on Running Rein ;
If stocks look down or bankers smash,
What call have I for ready cash ?
A fig for China !--Carpe diem! -
Would every man were wise as I am !-

CRICKET !- wert thou one of us,
(The Commons and the Omnibus,)
Pray, how would'st thou contrive to shirk
Egypt, Syria, or the Turk? -
Louis Philippe and his trenches, -
Cheering from the Treasury benches,
Bonham's boring, -Leader's prating,
All the stuff they call debating ?
Even Charley Buller vows he's
Hipped to death by “both their houses !"
GRUMBLER! - hadst thou no design
Tully of “ The Times" to shine ?
Had Ribands red, or green, or blue,
No attraction in thy view,-
If Treasury Warrants “ please to pay,"
Ne'er tempted thee on Quarter-day,
Nor ayes nor noes, - nor Lamb nor Peel
Would force the steam up of thy zeal.
'Tis self whom thou dost represent
In the High Court of Parliament !
CRICKET !- 'Tis not because a snobby
I do my duty in the lobby,
Fate doth her blows, as on a cur, vent
Upon your most obedient servant ! -
Dark Inkson's blackest books I stand in,
Burghart's defaulter I'd a hand in ;
My name is writ with all its vowels,
In ledger seventy-five at Howell's !
By way of assets Prussic acid,
A parish coffin, -and - Hic Jacet! -
GRUMBLER! - I see you think to nick it
By slyly making game of CRICKET ! -
NO GO! I'll neither back a bill,
Nor name a spendthriſt in my will;
But take advice, sir, - therewithal,
Insects, like men, are prodigal.
1 When house and lands are gone and spent
A prudent match is excellent; -
Woman of cents, — I mean the five,-
Reclaim the saddest rake alive!
A warm fireside, sir, snug as GRYLLO's,
A reading-chair, with patent pillows,
A hissing urn and Twining's best,
A Bentley's Mis. to give it zest, -
No books but Coutts and Co's to bore him,-
No debt, but Nature's, in terrorem,
No Almack's, with its varnished pumps,-
No Travellers', with its “ what are trumps,”-
With Madam, happy as a queen, he
Sings" Jubilate !" – like Rubini !
Sings Madam, with itgarnishedem, -
For my part, I am not addicted to English Misses ! -
I have no weakness in favour of pretty faces with as much
expression in them as that of a sunflower. It was there-
fore through no seeking of mine that the whole of that
season I had always a Maria or a Julia on my arm or in my
pocket ; that I was sung to, prattled to, — danced at,
- drawn at, - rode with, Airted with, by every muslin
frock purposing to promote its muslin into brocade. Five

years' absence from England had converted me into what
the silk-mercers call a “ novelty of the season.” Neither
mothers nor daughters were by any means certain what
might be my predilections. I was an open borough.
Anybody might have me, they fancied, who canvassed with
sufficient zeal ; and, as I live by cake, they did not spare
either themselves or me! -
I do not much like reverting to Lord Ormington. The
feelings prevailing between us were of too serious a nature
for trifling mention. Nay, I look upon our relative
position as the groundwork of a domestic tragedy of the
Christian world, fully as direful as the wrath of Nemesis,
or the persecutions of Neptune or Jupiter in the pagan.
Half the inexplicable antipathies we see in families arise
from misgivings or certainties, such as rendered me hateful
in his eyes; and if woman in her wanton follies would
only please to remember that, in addition to the shame she
is entailing on herself, she is concentrating hatred and
malice on the head of an innocent being, she might be per-
chance restrained in her career of sin. — But women who
indulge in wanton flirtations, have seldom feeling or sense
enough to be touched by such an argument.
I must, however, allude to his lordship so far as to
observe that, from the period of poor little Arthur's death,
he had never held up his head. It had been beyond my
strength of mind or body to attend the obsequies of the
poor lost innocent; but Lord Ormington accompanied Danby
into Lancashire to see him laid in the family vault, and
support the afflicted father. The unbaptized infant was
laid at the same time in the grave; and I verily believe
that, standing beside those two little coffins, which seemed
to complete the extinction of his legitimate branch, Lord
Ormington vowed against me a vow of eternal hatred. - I
am convinced he regarded me in the light of as accom-
plished an assassin as the cruel uncle of the Babes in the
Wood!
He had collected at the time all the newspapers detailing
this afflicting calamity; which, as it related to the heir of
a noble family dwelt of course with the utmost pomp and
circumstance upon the sad event. Morning papers, evening

papers, weekly papers, monthly summaries, nay, even the
Annual Register, of that disastrous year, were placed apart
in his private room, tied up with mourning-strings and
bindings, to be perused and re-perused whenever he found
himself overcoming the force of those grievous recollections.
He brooded upon his sorrow, as an old man might be
expected to do who knew that he, at least, should not
survive to witness its obliteration by brighter prospects.
For many months, Lady Susan lingered on the brink of
the grave; and even when the physicians pronounced her
out of immediate danger, they acknowledged that it was
most unlikely she should again become a mother.
Now had Lord Ormington's affliction been a truly grand-
paternal feeling of tenderness for the issue of the loins of
the issue of his loins, Danby's little girl, one of the prettiest
and most engaging little creatures I ever beheld, would
have sufficed for his consolation. But it was not so. I
knew from good authority that he never evinced the
slightest interest in the child. All his regrets were for the
two boys, - the heirs of his titles and estates, - the heirs
who were to have circumvented the pretensions of the
interloper, Cecil Danby ! - It was me he hated, not poor
little Arthur whom he loved. Nay, I suspect that in the
depths of his soul he would have by no means regretted
the death of Lady Susan, whose illness he affected to take
so much to heart. He wanted a wife for Danby who was
likely to become the mother of sons.
Meanwhile, the poor old man was shrunken up with his
afflictions, till nothing seemed left of him but his whiskers.
The wretch, Coulson, his eternal shadow, was now the
shadow of a shade. We had met once or twice, when, on
my return to England, I went to pay my respects to my
mother, who seldom left the house ; and as nothing had
occurred to justify any overt act of severity towards one
who bore his name and had been introduced into official
life under his paternal patronage, he was forced to meet me
on courteous terms. He had not even an excuse for
referring me, as he had done ten years before, to his
solicitors; though I accidentally discovered that, after
giving up all hope of an heir from Lady Susan, he had been

engaged day after day in professional consultations with
old Hanmer, concerning the possibility of cutting off the
entail of his estates. The law, however, stood my friend.
On that point, from the respect testified toward me by the
chaperoning class of the community, I knew myself to
be safe.
But what a cheerless and penitentiary-like aspect now
invested the house in Hanover Square ! It might be said
of its hopes, as of Ophelia's violets, that “they all withered
when my nephew died.” – From that day, the place had
never worn a smile. It looked doomed, — deserted, —
sorrow-stricken !- An air of dilapidation may be imparted
to a mansion in the best possible state of repair, by trifles
imperceptible to its inmates. Lady Ormington who was
now a confirmed invalid, (from the effects of a paralytic
attack, said by the physicians to be the result of laudanum,
whereas her ladyship protested the laudanum to be the
result of her illness,) never quitted the floor containing her
bed-room and dressing-room ; and Lord Ormington having
assigned to his own use two rooms on the drawing-room
floor, the great saloon, formerly so celebrated through the
fêtes and fashionabilities of my mother, was uninhabited.
No one but the housemaid ever entered there. The
windows, I suspect, had not been cleaned since I quitted
England. But what imparted a still more melancholy
look to the house in the eye of the passers-by than even
the thick encrusting of dust and soot streaked off in
certain directions by the pelting of April showers, — was
a row of old flower-pots, the plants in which had been
dead for years but still rustled their dry stalks in the
wind unsusceptible of the change wrought on all around
by the coming of the spring or departure of the summer.
In one corner stood a pile of red pans, which I suppose
had formerly contained these flower-pots; and the sparrows
chose to perch and build round this unsightly rubbish, as
though the house contained no living inmate. It was
scarcely possible to recognize its dull, dingy, dispiriting
façade as the same before which, on leaving college, I
found in daily waiting the smartest equipages in town
each with its pair of bloods and snowy-wigged coachman,

as proud on his hammer-cloth as a chancellor on the
woolsack.
No carriage approached that desolate doorway now, save
the humdrum vehicle of Lady Ormington's daily apothecary,
oilskinned and patent-leathered, from the servants' hats
to the horses' coats, as if to defy all inclemencies of
weather.
What is it I have seen quoted from Wordsworth, as
motto to some fashionable novel ? -
A pleasant spot it was, in times of old :
But something ailed it now, – the place was curs’d.
Even the servants, who remained unchanged chiefly because
his lordship and her ladyship wanted spirit to make
any alteration in their establishment, had oldened and
withered twice as fast as the menials of more vivacious
households..
I seldom wore down my spirits by entering the house -
I was almost as much out of Lady Ormington's good
graces as those of her lord. - She was angry with me for
being nobody; - reproached me bitterly with having
thrown away my prospects in life ; — showed me Herries
and his two thousand a year, and Sir John Harris and his
knighthoods, as examples of what I ought to have
achieved ; — protesting that had I stuck to the Foreign
Office and persuaded Lady Theresa to stick to me, we
should now have been Sir Cecil and Lady Theresa
Danby, Excellencies at Stutgardt, Munich, Naples, or some
other city not demanding a K.B. or K.G. in its ambassa-
dorization.
In vain did I assure her that I was one of the finest
gentlemen about town; — that I ate the best dinners in
the best houses, day after day, from January till July; that
my bons mots were recited at the Clubs, - my bonnes
fortunes whispered, wherever such things ought not to be
talked of.- She only shrugged her shoulders at my
boastings; muttering something which her paralytic affec-
tion prevented from being very distinct, about, —“Ay,
ay! Sir Lionel over again ; - and like Sir Lionel, he will
die in the Bench ! "

Poor woman! - she was so much impaired in intellect,
that it was impossible to resent her attacks.-
Nor had I any reason to feel piqued. Thanks to the
manifestations in my favour of Helena Winstanley, and
others of the beauties of the season, I saw that the game
was in my own hands ; four by honours and the odd trick.
I might become pretty nearly what I liked. Most people
might, if they only knew it ; — the faculty of knowing it,
constituting what the world calls genius. - To be a great
writer or a great painter, is the mere result of feeling per-
suaded that you are capable of becoming a great writer or
a great painter, and working up to the mark. - A man of
genius is, in fact, a narrow-minded man; a man with a
single pretension ; - a man who, like Milton or Shakspeare,
feels that he is only fit to write poetry ; - or who, like
Titian, will pass eighty years before an easel ; whereas a
man of extensive abilities is too clever to chain himself
down to an oar. — His tastes are universal. - He under-
stands a little of everything; - can paint a little, write a
little, play a little on every instrument. He is not borné
enough to produce a chef-d'ouvre. He could not go
scraping and polishing away at a block of marble for years,
to bring forth at last a Venus de Medicis or Apollo Belvi-
dere; or confine himself to a single canvass, like Michael
Angelo, for the sake of producing a Last Judgment!
Now Cecil Danby was a man of genius, or narrow-
minded man. - I was conscious of the power of becoming
dictator to the world of fashion, - and I became so. Even
when Brummell was on the throne, ten years before, I
regarded his dazzling supremacy as Oliver Cromwell in his
youth may have contemplated that of the Stuarts ; - and
in a recent interview with him at Calais, regarded him
much as the Protector surveys the features of the decapitated
King, in Delaroche's picture of Charles the First in his
coffin. -— Already, I was master of his sceptre !
One thing bored me. I always entertained a personal
leaning towards George the Fourth, both as the old friend
of my mother, as the patron of my boyhood, and as a
kindly-mannered, if not kindly-affectioned man. But I
had wit enough to perceive that, living in a reign where

coxcombry was courtiership, I should be lost by adhering
to the court. At Carlton House, I must of necessity
subside into an imitator, a shadow, an echo, -a
nothing! - It was only by a schism I had the least chance
of distinguishing myself.
But for my consciousness of power as a coxcomb of
genius, I should probably have attempted some other means
of obtaining renown; for I saw that the throne of
Dandyism was in its Lower Empire. The ornamental
was about to pass away, - the graceful to evaporate. -
As the decay of religions is perceptible in their recourse to
the accessories of materialism, -as Polytheism in its
decline sought aid from the chisel of Phidias, and Catho-
licism, when bereft of its influence, strove to renovate its
altars by the pencil of Raphael, — so Dandyism, at its last
gasp, called in the aid of Lawrence ! -
Ten years later, and I should have been born too late for
my vocation !

I HAVE been frequently disgusted in society, by the de
haut en bas style with which people having accounts in
round figures at their bankers, or coronets on their tea-
spoons, inquire of some great writer or artist, « what he
has been doing lately? –" as if his only purpose in life
were to paint or scribble. They would be amazingly
surprised if the painter or man of letters were to retort
upon them with an inquiry of what they had been
eating or drinking lately, — which, Heaven knows, is the
only purport of their existence.

People used to offend me by asking pretty nearly in the
same tone, on my first re-appearance in London, what
“ Danby was doing with himself ?” Of course I per-
fectly understood them to inquire why he had ceased to
speak in the House. From the moment of his debut in
public life, the world had looked on him as public pro-
perty; and felt entitled to resent his holding his tongue,
while there were so few orators extant in the most High
Court of Parliament. He sat there still, and still did
duty to his constituents and his country, if not to himself.
From the period of that heavy family affliction, he had
not once opened his lips. As the ancients used to cast
into the grave of their dead the most precious objects in
their possession, he seemed to feel that the noblest dedica-
tion he could make to the memory of little Arthur, was
his reputation as a public man.
I, who had seen him hanging distracted over the dress
of the lost child, like Jacob weeping over the bloody
garment of his son, could enter into his feelings ; and it
consequently appeared to me profanation when, in the
midst of a crowded ball-room, some trifler of the great
crowd suddenly addressed me with questions concerning
the seclusion of poor Danby, much in the manner they
would have talked of some sulky opera-dancer, or invalid
soprano. —
“ One never hears anything now of Mr. Danby! Does
he never mean to favour us again ? — We are waiting for
something striking. It is vastly disappointing when a
young man makes so promising a throw off, and does
nothing afterwards worthy his reputation. At one time,
it was thought he might end with leading the party.
Castlereagh is worn out. Peel will never have pluck to
succeed him. Danby has given no pledges, and would be
the very man for us, if he could only manage to get up
the steam again. To be sure, precocious flowers are the
soonest out of bloom. Perhaps it may prove that his vein
was a shallow one, and that he is worn out, --- a squib,
not a rocket. I am afraid it will appear that Emancipation
and Abolition were his Pillars of Hercules ; and that he
will never get beyond them.”

The only person who considered him improved as a
public man, was Herries. Herries detested oratory.
Herries conceived that every man, that is, every member,
went down to the House with his mind made up on the
questions likely to come before it ; and that the only word
of any real consequence in his power to utter, was “ ay,”
or “no.” Everything else was a work of supererogation,
an interruption to the business of the House. He felt
persuaded that the enlightenment of future times would
decree that Parliament should be managed like the courts
of law, - the Houses playing the part of jury, and the
Treasury bench and a sort of devil's advocate, the part of
plaintiff and defendant. A single speech on either side
would serve all purposes of debate. He had no patience
with the high-sounding harangues embroidered by re-
porters on the few mumbled words of certain popular
members, as substantial roads are grounded on a foundation
of faggots.
“ I'm sure I don't know what they want of Danby!”
- was the cry of my brother-in-law. “He never misses
a division. - What the deuce can he do more towards the
support of government?”
Herries considered that a strong human mind ought to
be inaccessible to argument ; that, even if one rose from
the dead to persuade them, people having a Tory con-
stituency should vote with the Tories, — people having
a Whig, with the Whigs. An independent member was
a sort of troublesome fool, a stumbling-block in the way of
practical people.
My brother himself, all this while, maintained a species
of dignity of all dignities to me the most imposing ; a
self-seclusion wholly distinct from refusals of dinner-
parties, or the surly veto of “not at home.” A self-seclu-
sion resulting from your influence upon the minds of other
people, is as effective in preventing their approach with
importunate questions or officious advice, as though you
were surrounded by yeomen of the guard backed by the
household brigade. Danby appeared in society whenever
there was positive occasion for his appearance. At political
dinners, royal or ministerial, he was a coveted guest ; and

those who met him at such solemnities rarely failed to
notice him as a man of cultivated mind and extended
intelligence. He affected neither gloom nor reserve. He
bore his family afflictions as though they were his own
concern, and not that of society. His fortitude was as
unaffected as it was earnest.
With me, his conduct was angelic. He saw how stu-
diously I avoided him; and as I had not courage to
approach his house, he came straight to me. Except a
slight tremor of the muscles round his mouth as he cor-
dially shook hands with me, there was nothing to induce
suspicion that he entertained any other feeling in accosting
me, but that of brotherly regard. - I am convinced that
nothing but the dread of inflicting pain, prevented him
from throwing himself on my neck and weeping bitterly.
We had not met since the stone was rolled to the door of
the sepulchre that shut in all the sunshine of his life ! -
How could he be otherwise than deeply moved by the
sight of one connected with such grievous associations ?
I saw by what severe mastery over his feelings his
voice was made to retain its usual tone, as he directed the
conversation to general topics, as remote as possible from
all that supposed a family interest between us. He talked
of my travels. —He had never crossed the Alps, yet knew
more of Italy than I, who had been wandering there for
years ! — He knew it through the classics, he knew it
through its modern writers, he knew it through painters,
historians, philosophers : -1, only by the practical itine-
rary of post-houses, restaurants, Opera-houses ! – It is
true I had stared at the Coliseum, and wondered at the
Vatican; but their moral influence had entered into the
soul of Danby, - he had studied the institutions in which
they had their rise. Dante and Macchiavelli, Petrarca,
and Tasso, had imbued his spirit with Italianism : the
utmost I could have done to meet him on this ground,
was to spout a little bad Corinne !
But I spared him all mock enthusiasm. There was
something so true in my brother, that to affect spurious
sentiments in conversing with him, would have been like
trying to pass a flash note on a child. I admitted frankly,

therefore, that I cared more for San Carlos and the Scala,
than the Duomo or Vesuvius ; and that the chief captiva-
tion I found in Italy, was the blueness of its skies and
the supportability of its winters. I said something about
green peas at Christmas, which he was good-natured
enough not to scout; and finding me as material as ever
in my tastes and feelings, fell upon neutral ground ; -
talked of the vegetation of Sicily, the quarry garden of
Prince Butera, — the papyrus attesting the Saracenic occu-
pation of the island, the palm-tree abiding there like
some naturalized foreigner, lingering within reach of its
African home.
“One of my inducements to visit southern countries,
Spain, Portugal, Greece, or Italy, -- would be the charm
of their evergreens,” said Danby. “ The laurel is the
only permanent verdure in which we excel; and I want to
see the ilex, the bay, the myrtle, the cypress, the arbutus,
in perfection. I have a passion for evergreens. To me,
they are the nearest approach to the growth of a celestial
sphere. Look at the orange with its flower, its fruit, its
glossy foliage ! Look at the bay with its musky verdure,
that seems created to over-shadow the grave of a poet.
Even the agapanthus and phyllerea of our cottage gardens
delight me ; even the yew and holly of our hedge-rows
have a charm. It is only a Frenchman who could up-
braid them as
• Deuil de l'été, parure de l'hiver.'
To me there is something sublime in their durability. A
very old evergreen, such as the ancient ilexes and bays I
have read of in Spain and Portugal, or the cedars of
Lebanon, conveys to my feelings an impression of awe!”
I dare say Danby wondered what there could be in these
remarks, to suffuse my eyes with tears and cause my lips
to tremble. I had never talked to him of Cintra, never
spoken of the grave of Emily, - inextricably connected
in my memory with the ever-verdant growth of espaliers
of orange-trees and myrtle, — the rustling of lofty pines,
— and above all, the shapely branches of a rich and
glossy bay ! -

I tried to change the subject, by expressing my sur-
prise that he had never been tempted to the Continent.
“ Like most' men ambitious of doing too much, I have
done nothing,” he replied, slightly shrugging his shoulders.
“I have always laughed at men's galloping tours, — whose
merit consists in the computation of so many hundred
miles a week; and so, to borrow from the epitaph, per
star meglio, sto qui. I cannot do all I want, under a year's
absence. In early life, I could not spare a year from the
ambitions of parliament ; now the infirmities of my father
and mother forbid me to quit England for so long a period.
You, to whom the peculiarities of our family are no secret,
must feel that for all our sakes I ought to be on the spot
in the event of the demise of either.”
From that first interview all awkwardness between
Danby and myself disappeared. Yet, on Lady Susan's
account, I refrained from the house. Though she ex-
tended her hand kindly to me, in pursuance of her sense
of Christian duty or of her husband's entreaties, she could
not command the complexion that went and came all the
time I was addressing her ; or the trembling of the lace
ruffle of her sleeve, as she extended her thin white hand
to mine. Such was the delicacy of her health, that I
could not answer to my conscience to expose her to the
struggle of such emotions. I even fancied that an invo-
luntary shudder pervaded her frame when I impressed a
kiss upon the forehead of my little niece, now a promising
little girl of seven years old, — extremely like Danby and
Julia, and yet pretty.
I inquired of Jane, whether she remembered Uncle
Cecil ? - Instead of replying, she looked so wistfully at
her mother, that I saw my name had been an interdicted
word in the family.
I resolved, therefore, that the family should be an inter-
dicted source of happiness to me. I could live without
them. It is astonishing how much one can dispense with,
so long as the illusions of youth surround one with a spe-
cies of rainbow atmosphere, reflecting its hues upon the
polished trivialities of social life!
I led a charming life of it; accepting everything that

glittered as graciously, if not as gratefully, as though it
were refined gold.
I had brought with me from abroad the sort of com-
municativeness, the facility in receiving and imparting
impressions, attained in continental society. - The great
world found me very amusing, because I suffered myself
to be amused, being itself too fine for any such concession;
- and if in reality less entertained by the show-off
dinners and well-rehearsed wit of the coteries, than by
half an hour spent in laughing devilry with Byron on the
shores of Como, or an evening passed in some modest
apartment of the Faubourg St. Germain, in a circle where
every one said his best, adorning with the charms of in-
telligence, as with a web of costly tapestry, the mean walls
and shabby furniture of the place, the delight of being
flattered and worshipped,-supplied all deficiencies of wit
or gaiety.
I should have preferred, I admit, a more matronly order
of worshippers. England is called the land of this, and
the land of that: - among other things, it ought to be
called the land of MissES ! - On the continent young
ladies are chosen for, in love and matrimony. In England
they are forced to strive hard to be chosen. - I do not half
like the position in which this order of things has placed
the poor little dears !— They are told to be modest, gentle,
undesigning ; then (like the itinerant Savoyards, supplied
by their proprietors with a monkey or cage of white mice,)
sent forth to dance and sing for the captivation of pas-
sengers, — and threatened with punishment if they return
at night unsuccessful. — For my part, I never blame
them when I see them capering and showing-off their
little monkey-tricks for conquest. The fault is none of
theirs. It is part of an erroneous system. However,
I should have been an ungrateful brute not to accept,
with thankfulness, the attentions of which I was the
object.
It was the spring time of the year, — that season when
the Gardener's Vade Mecum directs you to take in tender
plants at night-fall; and when the Chaperon's Guide
indicates the same' judicious foresight. From April to

a
August, it is equally part of my system to be taken in.
There cannot be a more agreeable vocation. — Of all
occupations for an idle London man, commend me to that
of being dupe to the mother of a very pretty daughter, in
possession of a comfortable house and good establishment.
Lady Winstanley was a capital hand at that sort of
thing. She had married her two elder daughters to calfish
elder sons of rich country baronets, by the mere charm of
an agreeable circle, where these animals found their crib
and hay in comfortable readiness, and where they were
more at home than in their own. The third daughter,
being of finer figure than her sisters, was destined by
mamma for the peerage. Mamma was right. - Helena
Winstanley was a tall, graceful, queenly creature,
Duchess D. G , or at all events, by the letters-patent
of Nature.
One night at a ball at Princess Esterhazy's, then in the
zenith of her beauty, I had been struck by the extreme
loveliness of a girl of peculiarly English aspect, — tall, fair,
well-proportioned, natural in her manners, and apparently
gracious in her address, for every one seemed pleased
whom she accosted. I inadvertently asked her name of
Lady Fitzharrington, beside whom I was standing ; who,
without even consulting my inclinations, turned towards
her with “ Miss Winstanley, allow me to present to you
Mr. Cecil Danby."
To manifest to one whose bow was so conciliating, my
indignation at the liberty taken with my august presence,
would have been misplaced severity. On the contrary,
I set about making myself agreeable as diligently as I
would have done to the Princess herself ; - 80 eagerly,
indeed, that a dignified, turbaned, chaperonly-looking
woman (to whom Lady Fitzharrington whispered a word
in explanation of my social position and Danby's state of
health,) began to look her eyes out in a contrary direction,
to conceal her satisfaction at the conquest achieved by her
daughter.
Miss Winstanley proved as pleasant as she was hand-
some. There was nothing very striking in her conver-
sation ; but on a young and pretty girl the desire to please

confers a charm. When the turbanned lady approached
to join in the conversation, I thought it decent to request
an introduction, and thus commenced my acquaintance
with Lady Winstanley and her family. Having, with
becoming assiduity, called her carriage and put on her
shawl, I jumped into my cab, and drove straight to
White's to finish the night, thinking no further of the
tall ladies, who, I afterwards discovered, went home with
the flattering unction laid to their souls of receiving a
proposal on the morrow !-
I met them again next night, — was again civil, and
again, more than civilly entreated. The following night
was Almack's; and as Collinet was in the orchestra, piping
the charming valse of “Gentille Annette,” - the rage of
the season, - I turned towards Miss Winstanley as the
handsomest girl nearest to me, and asked her to dance.
By good luck she was a charming valseuse. I saw as
well as felt, that we were acquitting ourselves to admira-
tion, and was pleased with her for the applause we obtained.
There was but one way of showing my gratitude. I took
her into the tea-room, and flirted with her through two
cups of weak bohea, a plate of brown bread and butter,
and biscuits enough to stock an outward-bound Indiaman
for its voyage to Canton.
There is something inexpressibly gratifying in the
envious looks cast at one by members who have not paired
off, as one sits lounging beside one of the handsomest girls
in a ball-room. The significant glance which looks
“Oh ho !—” the determination not to hear what is going
on, displayed in the countenances of the chaperons seated
near one, are vile encouragements held out to a flirting
man, to look irresistible and talk as if he did not know
what he was talking about.
I suppose Miss Winstanley understood what Cis Danby
talked of — for she seemed exceedingly pleased, and at
one moment I had serious apprehensions that she was
going to call for a third cup of tea. But Lady Win-
stanley, evidently thinking the great business of the night
achieved, begged me to ask for her carriage. I was
forced to stand half an hour in the old barrack of a

waiting-room, till Townsend got up the family coach; and
I saw one or two people smile, as much as to say “a
match !” when they saw me concealing behind the door,
from the air of the street and the stare of the footmen,
the smiling, silent, cloaked-up girl, so perfectly well satis-
fied to hang on my arm.
- Next day, I found on my table in Cleveland Row the
card of Sir Gabriel Winstanley. The next, I left two at
his door, as in politeness bound; after which, came a
formal invitation to dinner. I had half a mind not to go ;
for one knows beforehand the sort of fussy, full-dress,
grand dinner-party of a country baronet, with a clumsy old
service of plate, and clumsy butler, and clumsy saddle of
fat home-killed mutton, which looks as if meant for
Daniel Lambert to ride on. Having no engagement, how-
ever, for the day in question, I refrained from the cruelty
of an excuse.
I was agreeably disappointed. Sir Gabriel, a man who
spent his life at Boodle's, was a civil well-behaved person ;
who, I conclude, must have been rich in conversational
powers, for he certainly never expended any upon his
acquaintance. But he looked highly respectable, when
carving his own venison, (for he had a soul above muttons,)
and had asseinbled about him the chief worthies of my
ancestral county, wherein he was himself a landed pro-
prietor.
One is always worth five-and-twenty per cent. more
among one's county-people, than others. - It was to Lord
Ormington's Lancashire estates I was indebted for Helena's
smiles and her father's invitations to dinner. Sir Gabriel had
a very accurate notion of our family rent-roll ; — more so,
a confounded deal, than I had ;—and he and Lord and
Lady Fitzharrington, Sir John and Lady Styles, and Mr.
and Mrs. Whittington Leigh, talked county at me one
against the other, till I fairly wished the County Palatine
scuttled in the Irish Channel !
I wanted to chat with Helena. It was a very pleasant
thing to chat with Helena. Her greenish-gray eyes,
fringed with black lashes, her white skin, her expressive
lips, united their eloquence with her joyous, youthful voice,

to impart a charm to conversation pretending to nothing
beyond rational common-place. But rational common-
place is, in the long run, that which pleases most. Wit
keeps one too much on the alert to watch whether the
shafts it launches attain their mark. Humour makes one
nervous, lest it should degenerate into coarseness. Refined
wisdom oppresses one with a sense of inferiority. Origi.
nality is a pretension that renders one critical. But plain,
rational, common-sensical conversation, uttered by an
agreeable girl, beside whom one is sitting in a comfortable
cozy corner, wraps one round with a consciousness of com-
fort and repose. One has no fear of being startled, — no
dread of being quizzed. — C'est une nourriture saine et
abondante. One can fancy a long winter evening cheered
by such a companion, with the aid of a good fire, good
tea, and the last good novel.
The Winstanleys were now constantly inviting me.-
They had a Duchess-cousin, of whom they were prouder
than of their whole united family, who often lent them her
box at Covent Garden ; and they had one of their own,
the alternate weeks, at the Opera. The boxes were well
situated, - the family coach an easy one, — and old Win-
stanley's wines as good as the wine of that peculiarly in-
habitative and well-settled class of the community, - the
country baronets. I allowed myself, therefore, to be fre-
quently monopolized by Curzon Street. Helena had a
younger sister, almost as pretty and pleasant as herself.
The elder daughters were married ; -- the son was an aide-
de-camp in Ireland ;— the father, a fixture at his 'club.
There was no drawback upon the agreeable mornings I
lounged away in friendly chat with the mother and
daughters.
Now, I just ask my readers whether they discern any
impropriety in my acceptance of Sir Gabriel's invitation,
whether they see any harm in my allowing Lady Winstan-
ley to carry me to play and opera, Greenwich dinners about
and Richmond picnics ? --The summer was a fine one. The
Wanstead House sale was going on, to afford a pretext for
rural excursions. Another time, we rattled down to Kew,
to view the Botanical Gardens, and eat our cold chicken

uncomfortably on the grass. All these fits and starts were
of the Winstanley's own proposing. There was always
some engagement in prospect; always something that
enabled me in saying, “ Good-bʼye,” to add, " I shall
see you to-morrow.”
Will anybody be kind enough to recall to mind the
epoch when the English world became suddenly shamed
out of its apathy towards the woes of the sister-in-law
kingdom, - that hapless Island which, as Delos arose out
of the sea to afford a birthplace to those glorious twins of
nature, the sun and moon, Apollo and Diana, may be
surmised to have started out of the western main to afford
a fatherland to the twins of civilization, - Starvation and
Riot !- Will any one be kind enough, I say, to remember
the first Irish Ball given under the auspices of George the
fourth ?- Will any one describe to those who never heard
of the same, the brilliancy of the Italian Opera House,
floored into a ball-room, decorated with flags and lustres,
garlands, and trophies, but above all, beaming with
beauty from every box ?-
Lady Winstanley was not the woman to neglect such an
occasion for exhibiting her diamonds, her ostrich-feathers,
and her daughters, and even Caroline was to be let out
of the Misscage for the night.
Of course I was too fine a gentleman to play fine on such
an occasion. Certain of the Winstanley set of dandies, -
such small things as ensigns in the Guards, and younger
brothers of the calfish elder sons married to the elder
daughters, — expressed considerable uncertainty about
“ showing in such a mob.”—“ They had taken tickets —
they could not make up their minds whether they should
go." - Whereupon Lady Winstanley looked beseechingly
at me, as a hint that I should volunteer to be their
escort.
I had no thoughts of being anybody's escort. I hate
being tied down to time and place on such occasions ; when
a fit of indigestion, or an amusing paper, or a nap, may
render the postponement of dressing indispensable to one's
comfort.-I therefore expressed as much uncertainty about
going, as the poor affected creatures who could be compro-

mised by consulting (their inclinations on so slight an
occasion.
But it happened that, by a concatenation of circum-
stances impossible to record without violating the sanctity
of royal privacy (which from a person admitted to share
its hospitalities I look upon as an act of Low Treason),
I dined the previous day at Carlton House ; when I found
myself required to give my arm to one of the most beau-
tiful and distinguished women of the time.
One never objects to shine in public as the satellite of
a fair planet, unless one happens to be in love elsewhere;
which I was not. It was very agreeable to me, therefore,
to secure one of the best places of the night, and the
entrée of the private staircase, by the small concession of
attending on one upon whom every eye was turned on her
entrance.
It was not, however, till towards the close of that bril-
liant fête that, in traversing the ball room, whispering
somewhat closely to the lovely woman who was hanging
on my arm, we came suddenly upon Lady Winstanley's
party. - When lo! I saw the cheeks of Helena flush
crimson, then turn to an ashy paleness. — Five minutes
afterwards, as I caught a glimpse of them again, Lady Win-
stanley was anxiously despatching my cousin, Lord Wol-
verton—(whom the reader may be charitable enough to
remember when paying his court to Lady Harriet Vande-
leur, as “ little Squeamy,”) in search of the carriage. — I
would have given any thing to be able to offer my assist-
ance.—But the heaviest set of darbies is scarcely a greater
obstruction to a man's liberty of action than a beautiful
woman hanging on his arm.
This little incident spoiled the satisfaction of my even-
ing, which had promised to deserve a white cross. — All
the rest of the night, I was haunted by Helena's pale face.
- I flatter myself that, in my worst of times, I was never
much of a monster to these tender creatures.

temperaments, or the coarser sex with such powerful
attractions !
· By one of those inexplicable chains of association which,
more than all the preachments of the churches of Asia or
Europe, establish the immortality of the soul, I took no
further heed of my fair companion who was now the centre
of a circle.
My eyes were irresistibly upraised towards that fatal
box, — that hateful box of the d’Acunhas, — usually
undistinguishable among its fellows, but rendered remark-
able amid the brilliances of the fête by a chandelier placed
before it, and a waving banner appended to its façade. —
My eye seemed fascinated to the spot. — I fancied I could
see the well-remembered curls of chestnut hair still droop-
ing behind its eurtains !
Nec tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum,
* * * * *
Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli.
The result of my compunctious visitings was highly
favourable to Helena. I recalled to mind the disastrous
result of delay on a former occasion; and next day, not
later than two o'clock, was at her door.
Lady Winstanley was never visible at that hour ; but I
was privileged. The servants admitted me, saying they
would « let my lady know.” – Down came “ my lady's
in her dressing-gown, looking as agitated as an aspen in a
North-wester. — Poor woman ! - I am convinced she
thought I was come to propose for Helena ; for she in-
stantly mentioned that her daughter was indisposed, with a
headache from the extreme heat. — Yet by the nervous
anxiety with which she watched the door, every time the
slightest sound was audible, I saw that she was expecting
her down.
She came at last, and lovely indeed she looked; that is,
lovely to me, who did not fail to attribute a certain red-
ness of the eyelids singularly at variance with the smiles of
joy that dimpled her mouth, to a sleepless night, occasioned
by the supposed infidelities of a certain Cecil Danby. -
From that day, my attentions became more pronounced.

- All I said was spoken in whispers, and my looks said
more than words, - I took to dancing again, dancing being
the only privileged occasion for pressing declarations which
are no declarations at all; and not a supper-room in
London, whose door might not have told tales if it chose,
of the earnestness of the handsomest man in town, when
leaning against it with his eyes fixed in unclouded sunshine
upon those of one of its prettiest girls.
Lady Winstanley looked triumphant. She was in a
perpetual course of smiles. Though I could see, when
approached with congratulations by rival chaperons who
longed to tear her eyes out, that she vehemently begged
no one “ would suppose there was anything in it,” (what
English these women talk !) “the lady did protest too
much,” so much, indeed, as to leave a conviction on their
minds that the marriage settlements were in process of en-
grossment. Helena protested nothing,—she only listened,
- only smiled. - It is very agreeable to listen and smile
to a man who has all the appearance of being desperately
in love; and though the three distinct words, which would
have been more to the purpose than all the sighs and looks
I was lavishing, were never even hinted at, she had reason
to expect that the next moment might, at any time, startle
formal proposals out of my cautious lips.
Mammas get nervous when the month of June expires
without the undecided man coming to the point. When
July sets in, the landed proprietors grow harvest-bitten, and
want to have a look at the crops. — Sir Gabriel, I suspect,
bored them amazingly with his peas and beans, for I could
see that Lady Winstanley grew horribly agitated every
time he opened his mouth, lest he should fix the day of
their departure from town. Helena still smiled on, in
happy serenity. She saw me every morning in our riding
parties, — every night at our balls. — She was content. -
She took no thought for the morow. – No more did I. -
The King was to visit Scotland at the close of the
session, and I had received a gracious invitation to be of
the party. I had long been desirous to see the capital of
the ancient kingdom, with whose beauties it is a disgrace
to an Englishman not to be acquainted. - Whenever the

expedition was alluded to, I could perceive a smile twinkle
in the eyes of Lady Winstanley ; why, I can't pretend to
say.
One morning, towards the end of July, as I was coming
out of Watier's to go home to bed, by that peculiar,
greenish, aqua-marine light, through which one never sees
anything moving in London, but dandies and watchmen,
going their rounds, and their squares, — I was hailed by
Sir John Harris. He was driving home from Carlton
House, and sat swelling in his many-buttoned coat, as if
it contained something to be proud of.
Though he wanted only to acquaint me with the exact
day of our start in the royal yachts, which were to be
steamed to Edinburgh, he saw fit to add, -“But perhaps
after so gross an act as a match with a country baronet's
daughter, you will not like to show your face among us?"
“ Who says I am about to marry anybody's daughter ?”
said I, gravely.
- All the world.”
I expressed myself with suitable emphasis, concerning
the folly and impertinence of all the world.
“ I am glad to hear you plead not guilty, Cis,” replied
Sir John. " Believe me, I have said what I can, to ex-
onerate you in certain quarters. I have gone so far as to
contradict the report, at White's, on my own authority ;-
but no one believes me.”'
“ I believe you !” said I, drily.
“ They all protest,” continued Harris, not perceiving
my sneer, “ that you are perpetually fanfilé with these
people, and that you are seen dancing with the girl, night
after night.”
- What would you have ? — The Winstanley's invite
me to their house. - I can't help their having a daughter.
But it does not follow that I am to marry her.”
“ It does, I can tell you, in the eyes of —'
I made a coarse rejoinder by way of interruption ;
whereupon, Sir John touched his fine horse on the flank,
and away went the cab and its two brutes, at the rate of
fifteen miles an hour.
But the blow had struck home. I made a very late,

and very short visit to Curzon Street that day. Instead
of riding, I sauntered to the tennis court.
On my return home, there was a little flummering
three-cornered note, from Lady Winstanley, reminding
me that I was to meet them at Vauxhall, as she had a
supper-party afterwards ; to which I wrote a civil answer,
“ how could I possibly forget, &c., &c." But the
deuce a bit did I go near them.
The following day, I went down to Hampton races, - a
party at Oatland's. We made two pleasant days of it;
- and for two more after my return to town, I was so busy
paraphernaliazing myself for Scotland, that I found not a
moment to call in Curzon Street.
At the end of the week, came another note from Lady
Winstanley. “ What was become of me? - Was I lost?
-They were anxious lest I should be indisposed.” Not
having courage to show my face in reply to these kind in-
quiries, I stayed away :- played more tennis — more
écarté ; - saw Nicholls about my new stocks, — Elvey
about refitting my dressing-case, and divers other persons,
concerning whom there is no need to trouble the public. —
I went through all the duties, in short, of a coxcomb on
the eve of leaving town.
August was come ; — tawny, - copper-coloured, -
heart-achiferous August, — the terminator of so many
projects, — the blight of so many hopes. Lady Winstan-
ley's last little note informed me, that they were about to
leave town; and as, though I had no thoughts of marry-
ing Helena Winstanley or Helena anybody else, (how was
I to marry, - a gentleman in lodgings, with an embar-
rassed income of five hundred a year? -) though I had
no thoughts, I say, of making her Mrs. Cis, I had just as
little desire to make her unhappy; so I resolved to go and
take leave of her in the handsomest manner, attributing
my previous neglect to indisposition, and expressing a
hope that we should meet in Lancashire in the autumn.
I had lived on terms of sufficient confidence with my
brother vagabonds at Watier's, to know how very few
words whispered in a proper tone, to a girl who is leaving
town, by the fellow who has been flirting with her through-

out the season, suffice to send her into the family coach,
happy and contented, with renovated hopes for the event
of another spring.
It was a deuced hot day; the sort of day when one
begins to think about shooting-shoes and percussion caps,
and to feel a destructive propensity connect itself with the
name of the Moors. I sauntered into Gunter's on my way
to Curzon Street, for a white currant ice, — the only safe
species of nutriment in the dog-days.
From the mere aspect of the counters in Berkeley
Square, one might have sworn that the season was over!
Instead of vans at the door, clatterings of china and glass,
cross porters swearing under their green trays, and thou-
sands of white paper parcels, (all addressed to the same
happy house, destined that night to receive and refresh,
“ five hundred persons of the highest ton,”-) the tables
were covered with white paper parcels, addressed severally
to the five hundred persons of the highest ton, containing
the wedding-cake of the match of the morning, - as sure
a produce of the balls of the season as Sir Gabriel Win-
stanley's crops from seed-time.
I sat cooling myself with my ice to the proper temper-
ature of a man about to say good-b’ye to a beautiful girl,
to whom he has been making desperate love up to the
moment that made it clear to him the danger he had de-
signed for her, might light upon himself. When quite com-
posed and comfortable, I drew down my light brown
beaver hat, drew up my straw-coloured gloves, and nod-
ding to the girl at the counter, as much as to say, “ an
ice — put it down to my account,” lounged out of the
shop, and through Lansdowne Passage, - that emblem of
a younger brother's fortunes, - mean, dispiriting, and
without prospect, with overflowing wealth and enjoyment
bounding his views on either side.
I noticed, as I proceeded along Bolton Row, that grass
was growing between the stones. But the Winstanley's
door discovered a still more positive proof of the emptiness
of town. Straw was scattered before them,- not the
thick trusses announcing the advent of sons-and-heirs,—
but scattered straws, as when magpies are building their

all the family moveables not compassable within the family
coach.
Gone!-No need to knock and inquire. - The windows
were closed. - A maid of all-work was in charge of the

- Well! I am not sorry to be spared the leave-taking !-
Helena is a sweet creature, and I could scarcely have
borne to witness her emotion.”—
Relieved from all fear of meeting them, I ventured that
night to one of those charming little close-of-the-season
parties, where one says and does all one forgot to do and
say in June, at the Marchioness of Devereux's; who,
under Lady Harriet Vandeleurs's pernicious instructions,
had progressed into one of the many London women who
fancy that because their husband is a gambler, and on the
turf, they are excusable in taking a lover, who is probably
ditto repeated.
It was a charming little circle, — a circlet of stars ;
people who were of the expedition to Scotland, or above
even that. I observed that Lady Harriet, (who, like too
many women after losing their last vestige of good looks,
had lost her last vestige of good-nature,) seemed mightily
rejoiced to see me enter. I was consequently prepared to
find her prepared with a handful of sarcasms to fling in
my face.
“ Yes, — you are quite right to go to Scotland !” was
her reply to my announcement of my plans; “the further
you go out of hearing of the outcry raised against you by
those people, the better.”
“ What outcry, — what people?”—
“ The country-baronet-people, whose daughter you have
used so ill. They are going to take her to Clifton. She
is in a deep decline.”
“ The only daughter of a country baronet with whom I
am much acquainted,” said I, coolly, “is Miss Winstan-

ley, who is in blooming health at her father's place in
Lancashire !"
" I don't know what you call blooming health,” retorted
Lady Harriet; “but you may rely upon it that her
mother has been intrusting in strictest confidence to one
(hundred) or two of her intimates, that Mr. Danby has
behaved infamously to her daughter,-- paying her the
most serious attentions, without serious intentions ;
and "
“I swear they ought to publish a Hand-book or Flirting
Manual for the youth of both sexes !” interrupted I-
(afraid of what might follow,) "in order to prevent these
misunderstandings. I went constantly to Lady Winstan-
ley's, because she constantly invited me. How was I to
know she intended me to marry her daughter ?”—
“ She invited you because she thought you intended it.
Every body thought so.”
“I cannot see that everybody had any right to trouble
itself about the matter."
" Public flirtations are public property."
“ Did people expect me to be uncivil to a pretty girl
who did me the favour to gratify my passion for waltzing ?
I never saw more in Miss Winstanley than a partner, and
am pretty sure she saw no more in me. The everybody'
whom you quote as sitting in judgment upon my pro-
ceedings, is aware that I am a younger son, without a
guinea at my disposal.”
" A younger son, whose elder brother is in declining
health, without issue male. That fact is pretty well
known. Lady Cork asked me to present you to her, to
be the lion of one of her dinner-parties, as the man who
had found it convenient to get rid of a nephew who stood
between him and his inheritance,' the blackest of uncles
since him of the Babes in the Word !- Fact, 'pon honour !

English are of anything qui fait évènement. One of the
things which made you so much the fashion this season,

Winstanley is quite justified in going into a decline, to
get rid of such a monster. Meanwhile, pending my next
murder, what say you to some macédoine?”
But however indignantly I might scout Lady Harriet's
assertion concerning Helena and her disappointment, I felt
a little uneasy on the subject. The touching look which
betrayed her emotion on seeing me whisper to my fair
companion at the Irish ball, ever and anon recurred to my
recollection. I would have given worlds that the family
had been still in town, in order that I might pour balm
into the wounds of that loving heart.
It may be a weakness ;- but I cannot bear the thoughts
of a woman dying for love of a wretched tħing like me!

We love to have a laugh against the ancients for any little
absurdity we can dig out of Herculaneum, or unroll out of
the mummies of Egypt; that is, not a laugh, but a prose,
for the English would sooner get a prose out of any-
thing, than aught in the world, except ten per cent.
We love, I say, to inflict long exhortations upon young
gentlemen, whose ideas are shooting in the preserves of
classic lore, touching the vices of Epicurus, the follies
of Alcibiades, the enervation of the Sybarites, and so
forth; and if ever I am Lord Rector of the University of
Glasgow, to which, being a long-sighted and long-eared
fellow, I have long had pretensions, I have some un-
common fine writing in my desk, with which I mean to

pepper my address to the Schools, in a style to put to
shame one of Lord Brougham's super-extra articles. Now
I only ask any reasonable being, (and consequently do not
address the inquiry to professors, ushers, or schoolmasters,)
whether any weakness recorded of the enervation of Rome
or Greece ever exceeded the make-believe sailorship of
royal yachting?
Of all times and places where luxuriousness is out of
place, commend me to the wooden “ castle on the brine”
of the British sailor! Whether we regard a ship clergy-
manically, as a spot where only a plank divides one from
eternity, or fine-gentlemanically, as a spot where the
human heart heaves with emotions anything but tender
or elegant, we must admit that manly plainness is the
style appropriate to the deep, deep sea. — French varnish,
satin bolsters, gilded lamps, and arabesque mouldings, are
fit only for the vulgarity of a Yankee steam-packet. -One
of the wags of Watier's was pleased to say that, “ in the
fitting up of his yacht the King showed a great deal of
taste, — and deuced bad it was.”—
Not being responsible for this error of judgment, I con-
tented myself to enjoy our voyage in all the luxury of a
progress, as brilliant by sea as Queen Elizabeth's by land;
and must own that even my apathy was deeply moved by
the aspect of Edina, and as Ophelia with joy to welcome
the King and his yacht's company.
“ My heart warms to the tartan !” – I love the sound
of a pibroch and the sight of a kilt !—All that is left of
poetry or hardihood in the British islands is concentrated
in the land of the Stuarts, which deserved to have Sir
Walter Scott born among her sons ! - The Muse, steam.
engined out of England, -- starved out of Ireland, — has
taken refuge, I suspect, in some Highland cabin, — “o'er
the muir among the heather ;" to commune with the
storms of heaven and consecrate the earnest yirtues of that
peculiar race, who adhere to the sturdy virtues of their
ancestors, and maintain their national loyalty, though
robbed of the pomp and circumstance of regality which
endears the throne to the cockney perceptions of the good
city of London.

People talk of the coolness, caution, and reserve of the
Scots. — I wish those who regard them as cold and re-
served had seen them fling up their bonnets for King
Geordie !- Edinburgh not only honoured and obeyed us,
but fed and cherished us, as though “ bonnie Prince
Charlie” were come again. It was very generally noticed,
indeed, in the papers of the day, that a distinguished in-
dividual in the royal suite bore a remarkable resemblance
to the portraits of that unfortunate Prince, (produced,
perhaps, by dressing after them,) but whether the allusion
were to myself, or to Sir William Curtis, history must
determine. Of this I am certain ; — that not a son of the
mist threw his Highland flings more strenuously than
myself, or more ardently enjoyed the “ sparkie” which
inspired the effort.-
I love a reel ! _“ furor brevis” perhaps, but one of the .
pleasantest little bits of madness in the world ; — always
in its proper time and place, and not episodizing the
pale monotony of an English ball, to make the Londoners
yawn or shrug their shoulders. - Among the hills, and
with a' sonsie lass for a partner, I swear I could keep it
up from July to eternity! — When Pope wrote about
“ wafting the soul upon a jig to heaven,” he was clearly
thinking of a Highland reel.
The only thing that kept down my spirits at Holyrood,
was the painful idea which, in spite of all my efforts,
would intrude, of what might be going on at Winstanley
Manor.--I had no means of obtaining information.—Lady
Harriet's intelligence might be accurate. — With the fatal
experiences of my past life, and the memory of Cintra and
Venice vivid in my thoughts, I had, indeed, some reason
to be anxious. — So long as I lived with Byron, the ro-
mance of life was smoked out of my head, like Tobit's
fiend, by the extreme practicality of his views.-But, after
being some time absent from him, the finer impulses of
the soul budded again, like an esculent cut down for the
vulgar uses of the table, and sprouting anew at the return
of spring. I found myself remarkably sentimental after a
fortnight's phili-beggary among scenes consecrated to all
that is glorious in the annals of Scottish history or song.

I don't know how it may be with the young fellows of
the present day. I am afraid Crockford's has had a de-
moralizing influence. People eat better than they used;
and I have observed, that where the cooks are good the
morals are indifferent. Perhaps, therefore, the lads I hear
boasting of their conquests and flirtations, may be less
accessible than we used to be in my time to emotions of
pity and terror, when we heard of some gentle creature
sorely tempted by the fish-pond in her papa's pleasure-
grounds, or the phial labelled “ Jaudanum ” in her
mamma's medicine chest. Poor Helena ! — It was just
the time that prussic acid began to be talked of as an
accessory in heroic life. And the reader will be pleased
to bear in mind that, as yet, stomach-pumps were not ! -
Poor Helena ! - After all, we London men have much to
answer for. There is a worse place waiting for us than
the limbo of vanity.
It was a relief to me to obtain, through Sir John Harris,
(by whose means all things were obtainable, from a mitre
to a Guelphhood,) his Majesty's sanction to my quitting
the royal cortège at Edinburgh, and cutting across the
country to Ormington Hall. I had made up my mind
never to enter the domain again; but I found that his
lordship was with Danby, in the south ; and consequently
seized upon the pretext for visiting Lancashire, as a
means of hearing something of Sir Gabriel Winstanley's
daughter.
It is a hazardous thing to storm a country-house during
the absence of the family. Though it was the month of
August, Ormington looked as dreary and smelt as mouldy
as the family vault. The country servants ran about as if I
had headed an incursion of the Picts and Scots. The steward
talked about killing a sheep, (I would have knocked him
down had he proposed a calf !) and everybody laboured
hard to make me aware that my arrival was as much out
of season as a hare in March.
The only person from whom I had hopes of learning
what I wanted to know, was the Reverend Dr. Droneby,
who was lucky enough to have succeeded to the family-
living which my Oxford follies placed within his reach ;

a dry, solemn old chap, supposed to have considerable
influence with Lord Ormington. His parsonage lay half-
way between Ormington and the Manor ; so that he was
likely to be well-informed touching the movements of the
family. But it was scarcely possible to get a word out of
him. He was, of course, a magistrate ; and looked at me
precisely as if he had a warrant of the peace against me
in his pocket. I was glad to bow myself out of his pre-
sence, with information that the Winstanleys were not at
home.
In reply to my inquiry as to what had taken them back
so suddenly to the south, he replied with a grim smile,
that he believed the journey was undertaken on Miss
Winstanley's account; and looked so maliciously pleased
when he said it, that I felt sure something afflicting was
in progress. Recalling to mind the horrible consequences
of my delay at Lisbon, that very night I got into the
London mail. I would not play Titus well, even half a
day.
An hour or two after my arrival in town, I breakfasted
at my club. The morning papers, fresh ironed, were on
the table ; and, while my dry toast was crisping I took up
the Morning Post. A disagreeable presentiment assailed
me as I unfolded the sheet.- On my way from Cleveland
Row up St. James's Street, I had been instinctively
repeating to myself those touching lines of Byron :-
When we two parted
In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted,
To sever for years;
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
Colder thy kiss !
Surely that hour foretold
Sorrow to this !
They name thee before me,
A knell to my ear ;
A shudder comes o'er me, -
Why wert thou so dear ?
and I swear a knell did seem to sound in my ear, and a
shudder to gooseflesh me from head to foot, as I cast
my eyes upon the tittle-tattle of that confounded Morning
Post!
For at that instant the name of Winstanley caught my
eye !-- Helena, - my Helena ! -

“We understand that Thursday next is appointed for
the solemnization of the splendid hymeneals, by special
licence, between the young EARL OF WOLVERTON, and
HELENA, the third daughter of Sir GABRIEL WINSTANLEY,
BART. of Winstanley Manor in the county of Lancashire,
and Moy Park in the county of Fermanagh.”
“ Lady Teazle, by all that's damnable !” – Little
Squeamy, by all that was preposterous ! - little Squeamy
and my Helena! -
I leave to the imagination of my readers, though not the
strong point of the British idiosyncrasy, the fussy self-
consequence of Lady Winstanley under such circumstances.
Just as the calfish elder sons united with her elder
daughters had been thrown into the shade by the younger
son of an Earl, was the younger son swamped by the real
presence of the Right Hon. the Earl of Wolverton, a man
with a park, — with a villa, — with a house in town,-
with family diamonds, — with everything a man who
respects himself ought to possess, to propitiate the right-
feeling mother of a right-thinking daughter. He was a
donkey; but what then ? - Did not the omniscient William
Shakspeare allegorize, in Titania and Nick Bottom, the
disproportionate passion of the fairest of faries for a fellow
with an ass's head ? -
I do not ask my readers to share my indignation on
discovering from Wolverton, — whom I met one day
coming out of Gray's shop with a ring-case worth 9001. in
his hand, – that he had been accepted on the very night
of the Irish ball : that the red eyelids, — the tremours of
mamma, — were all tributes to his merits, not to mine. —
Either these people were the cursedest hypocrites, or I was
the vainest fellow in the world.
Let me concentrate in the fewest possible words the
sequel of the adventure. Trusting to my à-plomb to
prevent my chagrin from being apparent, I got through
a visit of congratulation, and was invited to the wedding,
There was not a soul in town to be the wiser for it.
But I thought it would look well in the papers, for both
our sakes, if I patronized the performance.

Let the public conceive, if it can, the Mercury of John
de Bologna, dressed by Stultz, curled by Smith, and booted
by O'Shaughnessy, in order to picture to itself Cis Danby,
while standing, as near as decency and the Bishop would
allow, to the altar of St. George's Church ; in contrast with
the puny Earl of Wolverton, a little black aphis, who
wanted only a needle run through him to fasten him into
a glass-case, in order to form an interesting addition to a
cabinet of natural history. I trust the contrast was
dramatic ! — I flatter myself that Hyperion and a satyr
occurred to others besides myself !--
The insect hopped and skipped about merrily, however,
at its wedding breakfast ; though poor Helena was too
thoroughly blinded by tears to notice its saltations. For
my part, I had courage to remain at the window with the
rest of the party, to see Sir Gabriel place her in her bridal
chariot-and-four, while the populace stood by applauding.
Our eyes had not met, since the announcement of her
marriage. I am glad she did not see me then, for I
suspect I cut a sorry figure. Sir Moulton Drewe, turning
towards the breakfast-table, invited me to take a glass of
sherry with him, in a tone that plainly inferred “ You had
better, or you will never get through it.”-
This roused my courage. On quitting the house, I
persuaded him to send away his cab, — for, at that de-
populated season, any equipage but an errand cart depositing
hares and partridges, attracts attention in the streets, —
and saunter to White's for a game at billiards. It was
indispensable that he should do justice to the steadiness of
my hand; which he did, to the tune of a pony or two,
before we parted. At that moment I loathed him. He
was the friend and confidant of Wolverton, and must
have guessed, pretty nearly to a pang, all I was suffering.
On reaching my lodgings, I despatched a letter to
Byron, telling him to expect me shortly in Italy. ~I
knew he was at Genoa, - a city of palaces towards which
my aristocratic tendencies always inclined me,-surrounded
only by the Gambas and Guiccioli tribe; which, from the
same prejudice, I greatly preferred to the linen-drapery
connection. His letter-press confraternity was beyond my

powers of toleration. Literature is, in my opinion, little
more ennobling, as a matter of traffic, than calicoes or
jacconots; and as a matter of anything else, to borrow
from the renowned Bishop of Derry, “three blue beans in
a blue bladder.” Shelley, however, was really a fine
fellow - gentleman to the backbone; and I have read a
novel of Trelawney's which almost reconciled me to that
trumpery branch of scribbling, - As to poetry, I will not
do so tame a thing as decry it. - It is base to speak ill of
the dead. I never kick a man when he's down ; and the
Muse has been so long consigned to the House of Correction,
that I doubt whether she would get a situation as maid-of-
all-work, if it depended upon character.
But Byron had extricated himself from his literary
associations since the death of poor Shelley; and I thought
myself sure of renewing those pleasant times when, Lon-
don abounding with Kings and Emperors, such potentates
as Byron and Cis Danby were allowed to descend into the
pleasures of private life; — those times when, living
familiarly with
Moore, Danby, Rogers, all the better brothers,
Childe Harold never forgot what was due to himself or
other people.
From the tenour of Byron's answer, I found that he
had again surrounded himself with persons whom I did
not affection. Like amber, Byron had the unlucky faculty
of attracting straws. The Mereparks, who had spent the
preceding winter at Rome, warned me to avoid a clique
certain to entail upon their associates a disagreeable noto-
riety; for in a city where there is neither a sovereign
pontiffess, nor English ambassadress, people sometimes
find their way into society whose names are elsewhere
spoken in a whisper.
Nothing is less satisfactory than the company of people
smarting under the contempts of the world. They see
things in a false light. The irritations under which they
are writhing, beget bitter blood. They are always talking
at something or somebody, — always tilting with wind-
mills. — Moreover, though a handsome, clever woman, be

she who she may, is adorable so long as she content herself
to remain a handsome clever woman, — by affecting the
fine-ladyism of a promoted lady's maid and the jargon of
a précieuse ridicule, she becomes as wretched a thing as
Shakspeare's bust, daubed with red and blue paint by the
bad taste of the Stratford churchwardens.
I consequently extricated myself from my Genoa engage-
ments, and have since lauded my stars therefore ; – having
no mind to figure in anybody's memoirs but my own; or
that pennies should be turned by my sayings or doings,
for the behoof of others, even though the purse destined
to receive them be emblazoned with a coronet. I often
admire how certain of my contemporaries, even now, allow
themselves to be booked, to be made merchandize here-
after ! But flattery, i. e. blarney, is the true song of the
Sirens, —
Aditum nocendi perfido præstat fides ! -
J
No matter !— there are certain fraudulent accounts, which
posterity will balance with the rigid accuracy of a Trea-
sury cashier!
Between irresolution and disappointment, I loitered
through the winter; undergoing a severe course of country-
houses. — We are very proud in England of our country-
house life; and as regards good eating, drinking, sleeping,
hunting, and shooting, nothing can exceed the attraction
of some dozen or so of our residences of the nobility
and gentry,” who are obliging enough to keep open house
for our sake and their own ruin.
But generally speaking, I have found the thing a bore.
Sixteen hours of the twenty-four is too much to devote to
one's fellow-creatures. In a country-house, one can never
be alone. When sinking under the labour of having been
agreeable and chatty through the evening, fellows will
come and talk scandal in one's room at night. The women
get up piques among themselves, to relieve the monotony
of the mornings when their male moieties are hunting or
shooting ; - or worse still, private theatricals or charades,
to prevent their hunting or shooting. And then the groom
of the chambers prohibits smoking in the bed-rooms; and,

pour comble de malheur, just as one gets inured to the
detestabilities of the house, just as one has found out the
deaf side of the padrone, the easiest arm-chair and coziest
corner, it is time to go away, and begin one's expe-
riences in
– fresh fields and pastures new !
As to the gaiety of a country-house in the Christmas
holidays, it is as forced as its pine-apples, - as much
“ got up” as its theatricals. Either the party is as dull
as a dormouse, — a sort of vapid compromise between
public and domestic life; or enlivened by a monkey-man
or two, invited for the purpose, and pestiferously dis-
agreeable to gentlemen who are disposed to take things in
an easier manner. I could almost as soon amuse myself
among a showman's puppets, as with those who must be
moved by a master-hand, to endow their wooden nature
with vitality and fun.
All this time, the Wolvertons were at their place in
Ireland ; and the papers gave an eloquent account of the
roasting of oxen and firing of cannon to welcome the
young Countess, which must have caused the heart of
Lady Winstanley to sing for joy.
Our first meeting after her marriage was at a concert
given at Almack's by Rossini, the following spring, where
poor Maria Garcia made a débût little in accordance with
the after-fame of Maria Malibran. While pressing as
near as I could to the piano, to catch a glimpse of Ros-
sini's masterly accompaniment to his wife's miserable
singing, my attention was attracted by a tremendous blaze
of diamonds. — I seemed to recollect the face to which
that gorgeous tiara and those splendid girandoles imparted
lustre. - I looked again. The cheeks were hollow,— the
eyes far less brilliant than the diamonds. Beauty was
there, but beauty on its wane. Even when convinced by
the observations of those around me that it was no other
than Lady Wolverton, I could scarcely bring myself to
believe that the bony arms and shoulders before me ever
belonged to the fair, round, symmetrical figure of my
lovely Helena! She looked worn,—woebegone,-harassed.

-Was the gratification derived from the sparkling diamond
tiara, sufficient compensation for such change? -
A day or two afterwards, I met Wolverton at White's.
Bustling up to me, he made a sort of ostentatious show of
inviting me to his house, - talked about the taste displayed
by Gillow in fitting it up, as if to decoy me into a visit ;-
and hinted at the merits of his cook, as if that must be a
sufficient inducement. I would rather have “ chopped” at
the “ Blue Posts," as I once did, fifteen years before, with
Sir John Harris, before our faces were as well known on
the pavé as the effigy of Britannia on a penny-piece!
In process of time, the Countess of Wolverton was
presented at Court: - the Countess of Wolverton was most
graciously welcomed by the King:— the Countess of
Wolverton figured in the lists of Almack's and at the fêtes
of D_ House. — I hope she was satisfied ; – that is, I
hope Lady Winstanley was satisfied; — but she did not
look so. A son-and-heir was in expectation. It might be
that such an accession was indispensable for the completion
of Helena's worldly peace. It was clear that something
was wanting.
I left cards at her door, sent an excuse to Wolverton's
formal invitation to dinner; and, to spare her feelings or
my own, was careful to avoid her amid the mobs of
fashionable life. One night, at a Saturday supper party
at Lady Li's, after the opera, I met her on the stairs; and,
seeing that her situation rendered it difficult to her to
ascend, could not avoid offering her my arm. I did not
speak, however, more than the mutter indispensable to the
occasion; and she accepted my aid in the same silence.
We walked up slowly together, without exchanging a
syllable ; then separated. It was the only time I ever
approached her after her marriage; the trembling of her
arm and mine mutually betraying to each, the agitation of
two persons but a year before all in all to each other, and
now far less than nothing.
The most offensive part of the business was the self-
importance of that wretched little item of humanity,
Squeamy, I beg his pardon, — the Earl of Wolverton.

and fortune, when we find them invest a pigmy with the
attributes of a giant, and make a man of a mouse ? -
Thanks to this twofold endowment, had not the most
insignificant atom in human nature pinned to his sleeve the
handsomest girl in London ?
Thousands and thousands of times have I wished I had
been at Jericho, or Genoa, or Coblentz, or anywhere else,
sooner than have come in contact with Helena, that night
at the supper party. Just as she was dropping my arm in
the lobby, the light of the lustre over our head fell upon
her half-averted face, betraying certain glitterings, emitted
not by her diamond coronet, since she wore round her
head only a garland of blush roses. For, years afterwards,
her tearful eyes haunted me!-- Those diamonds were as
thoroughly my gift to Helena as the tiara of the Right
Hon. Earl of Wolverton! - All I had done in return for
her young affection was to wither up her beauty, and tinge
her bridal honours with misery and remorse!
Even attired as she was, however, the world was
amazingly struck by her loveliness, - her simple dignity
of air,- her gentleness of manner. The fine ladies were
astonished to see any thing so distinguished emerge from
the park of a Lancashire Baronet. The fine gentlemen
whispered, “By Jove ! Cis, you are a more prudent fel-
low than I should have been in your place.”
Lady Winstanley, meanwhile, went fussing every day to
her daughter's fine house, in Berkeley Square, seeming
to have lost all recollection of her elder daughters and their
calves. It was a bitter mortification to her, that in Helena's
delicate state of health, Lord Wolverton would not hear of
giving a ball; not only because to a vulgar woman, like herself,
a ball appears a mighty triumph, and indispensable to confer
the honours of canonization in London society ; but be-
cause, being still involved in the Miss-eries of human life,
she thought that Helena owed to her younger sister the
chances of promotion insured by such an advertisement.
But the little Earl was inflexible. When he had made up
his little mind, it was as firm as the minds of bigger men.
All the time, I was secretly patting him on the back;
encouraging his resistance, and begging him, above all

things, to beware of giving way to the influence of Lady
Winstanley. I described a mother-in-law to him in general
terms, and his own in particular; and flatter myself he
made himself sufficiently disagreeable to Lady Winstanley
to atone my wrongs and those of Helena.
Meanwhile, balls delighting me no longer, nor ball-
givers either, I profited by the glorious weather of a
delicious June, to betake myself to Cowes. I had nothing
to do in London, that is, London had nothing for me to
do; and at a certain period of the year, provided the
summer do not set in too severe, I am usually affected with
the marine epidemy, peculiar to the English constitution.
I suppose it is because Britannia rules the waves that
Britannia's sons and daughters, -cetaceous monsters! -
cannot rest contented without once, a year, rushing into
them.
I am almost ashamed, at this time of day, to indulge
in a rhapsody about yachting,—now, as vulgarized as
coaching, or steeple-chasing, or any other pastime of the
Paradise of Fools. But when I and George IV. first in-
dulged in the delicious recreation, regattas were in their
infancy, and the high seas a highway for gentlemen. I
used to delight in it, when one had the Isle of Wight
almost to one Self; that is, almost to the little knot of
elect which ought to be esteemed as one man.
Merepark, who was the fortunate proprietor of the
“ Morning Star,” as well as of the charming Lady The-
resa, proposed to me to accompany him that year, in a
cruise to the Mediterranean. Lady Merepark was to be
of our ship's company. I had rather she had stayed at
Cowes ; but that regarded the will of her ladyship's and
the Morning Star's lord and master.— I did not, however,
so much regret her being with us, when, on fine moonlight
nights, the harmonious couple were good-natured enough
to amuse me and the dolphins by singing duets; and if
most “ silver sweet sound lovers' tongues by night," I can
assure my readers that the Notturni of Lord and Lady
Merepark as we set together on deck, enjoying the fra-
grant breeze from shore off the coast of Sicily, were as
mellifluous as the song of the Sirens.

I liked Merepark's singing as much better than his
talking, as I had once been disposed to prefer his conver-
sation to his vocal efforts. Since his secession from diplo-
matic life, he was growing domestic as George III; -
resided three fourths of the year at Chippenham Park,-
and was, of course, as crotchety and dogmatical as all
people who choose to exempt themselves from the modi.
fying influences of society.
More than once had he forced me to exclaim, in the
words of a poet now laid on the shelf, and whom I conse-
quently always find on mine,
Ye powers who rule the tongue, if such there are,
And make colloquial happiness your care,
Preserve me from the thing I dread and hate,
A duel, in the form of a debate;
The clash of negatives and jar of words,
Worse than the mortal brunt of rival swords.
From the days of Plato, I scarcely know an individual
qualified to think for hiinself, in opposition to his times
and country. It requires about a million of men to form
an Opinion with a degree of force intitling it to be stereo-
typed. I hold, (I fear it may be a Danbyical dogma,)
that there are about a dozen capital Thinkers in Europe,
patented to have notions of their own; – viz., London,
Paris, Petersburg, Vienna, Rome, Berlin, Madrid, Munich,
- and so forth. These have a right to argue among
themselves, on all topics affecting the enlightenment or
amelioration of mankind. But little rap-on-the-knuckles
disputations between the egotism of John Thompson and
the egotism of Tom Johnson, - or between Cis Danby
and Lork Merepark, - are just as much to the purpose, as
the spitting of tabby cats, or the snarling of terriers out of
employ.
Whenever Merepark began to dogmatize, accordingly, I
said to him, as nature did to Béranger,
Chante, chante, pauvre petit !
which he did, — divinely ; — and so we left the balance of
power and of the budget, to those M.P.'d into the privi-
lege of prosing. – Lady Merepark did not look at all
obliged to me. She knew, probably, that the whims and

fancies which I did not choose to accept as infallible,
would be inflicted on her, like a papal bull, per tyranny
matrimonial, at Chippenham Park.
Poor thing! - she was the pattern of a wife! How
little I surmised, when in my puppy days at Maybush
Lodge, I pronounced her to be a nonentity, how charming
a compound part of the monotonous domestic happiness of
an English earl, such a nonentity might become ! - She
was the very thing for a nine months-in-the-country sort
of life; a loving mother to little Lord Chippenham, and a
loving wife to his father. All her ambitions were bounded
by the park paling.
If I should ever live to accomplish a park paling, I trust
Providence 'will send me precisely such a wife. And why
not? It is impossible to guess how one may end. The
jocose old screw of a lawyer, whom I had found rubbing
his hands in a barn in Southampton Buildings, in 1810,
was now, in 1823, a wealthy baronet, residing in a hand-
somely furnished house in Chandos Street, Cavendish
Square ;—Pepper-and-salt being replaced by a butler,
square and solemn as the Principal of a college, - but
better dressed.
Such progresses are of daily occurrence in England. A
wealthy landowner's man of business is as sure to fatten in
means, as his stalled oxen in flesh; and a baronetcy is
cheap requital for such services as killing off a young lady
likely to inveigle one of the junior branches into matri.
mony; more particularly when there is a borough in the
family, and only one younger son to provide for.
It is true Sir Joseph Haniner had achieved the distinc-
tions and comforts of life after losing the five senses that
might have enabled to him to enjoy them; and now, he
lay, like a superannuated wolf in his lair, feeble and eden-
tated, yet shunned and dreaded through his former ill-
repute. The creature had even sat in parliament for half
a session. Think of such a man as old Hanmer being
called, by such a man as Danby, — “my friend, the
Honourable Member for Sneakington !”—.
I know not why I recall, at this portion of my memoirs,
the name of one who, God wot! occupies small space in

my regard ; unless, indeed, because the reminiscences
therewith connected were painfully revived by a visit I
paid to Cintra, while touching at Lisbon in our cruise.
The Mereparks were, of course, occupied with the city,
the opera, the embassy,- Mafra, the Necessidades, the
Ajudas, and the various lions of the place.-We were to
be at anchor only a couple of days. The first of these I
devoted to a pilgrimage of grace to San José !
The quinta was all but in ruins. Old Barnet's property
had been converted into a chancery suit by Messrs. Hanmer
and Snatch ; and was, perhaps, the remote origin of the
comfortable house in Chandos Street, Cavendish Square.
The roof was falling in, and there were stems of oats which
had sprung up and withered. unmolested between the
floor of the drawing-room, in the place where poor Yilko
formerly sidled on his stand!
The garden was a wilderness. The orange orchard
had run almost as wild as the chestnuts and cork-trees
springing from the rifted rocks of the Peninha. The
espaliers of myrtle, untrimmed for years, were sheeted
with snow-white blossoms; closing up, by their inter-
mingling branches, the road to the postern door. — For
years, no one had passed that way. It was useless to
think of reaching the cemetery in that direction.
It was easy enough to make the circuit by the public
entrance. To accomplish this, I had to penetrate through
the grove of pine-trees — of all the objects that presented
themselves, the one which had experienced least alteration
in the lapse of those thirteen busy years. Sir Joseph's
chancery job had effected no change in the mystic characters
upon the venerable bark of those majestic trees. The
same mossy fibrous ground was under my feet, the same
dim, chastened, cathedral-like light was diffused around
me, - so often described by poor Emily in our happy
interchange of thought and feeling.
From this mysterious twilight, I emerged into the little
burying-ground. Death had not been inactive. Of the
many despatched by the caprice of northern physicians
to end their consumptive days in Lisbon, a few repose at
Cintra. Since my last visit to the spot, tombs had arisen,

- marble columns, - crosses of granite within trellised
enclosures,gloomy with cypresses or bright with flowers.
I passed them by unheeded. I made my way straight
towards the spot overhung by the outstretching branches
of the bay-tree. I could have reached the spot blindfold !
- And it was well for me that my memory was so re-
tentive; for not a trace remained of the stone tablet ! —
Within the railing I had caused to be erected around it,
before I quitted Lisbon, the honeysuckle planted by my
hand had sprung up in wanton luxuriance; and no friend
of the family being at hand to direct or remunerate the
gardener of the cemetery, to whom was consigned the care
of the other tombs and funereal gardens, it formed an en-
tangled mass of blossoms over the grave, concealing all
record of her who slept beneath that flowery dome.
The sun was crimsoning the west when I reached the
spot; and the overpowering fragrance which evening dew
extracts from the pale tassels of the woodbine, pervaded
the air, till the senses seemed to ache with its sweet-
ness! -
Thus it was that the memory of Emily deserved to be
embalmed! – Nature remained faithful to a grave to
which none survived to offer the tribute of their tears. —
That tangled and perfumed mass of mournful-looking
blossoms, formed the most appropriate monument to the
memory of the dead. — I looked towards the craggy sum-
mits of the mountains visible between the dark cones of
the cypress trees, on which the evening sun was shedding
its effulgence, and prayed that from the regions of the
Blessed the anguish of my soul might bring down forgive-
ness of my fault ! —
Next day, we sailed for England. But the influence of
these renovated associations saddened me for the remainder
of the voyage. I could enjoy nothing ; — neither the
sweet music of the Wolvertons, nor the calmness of those
halcyon summer nights, at sea so far more enjoyable than
the fervour of garish day.
The Mereparks having engagements with visitors at
Chippenham Park, altered their plan of touching at Cowes,
and made straight for Southampton. It was a delicious

evening on which we sailed up the river. After the lan-
guid atmosphere of the sweet south, there was something
refreshing in the stirring air of home; more especially
intermingled as it was with the breath of gardens and
emanation of the oak-woods, from the shores of the South-
ampton river.
As we sat together on deck, I persuaded Merepark to
indulge me for the last time with a favourite ballad, the
words of which originated, I suspect, in the sunny climes
we had been traversing.
She look'd so fair when, fresher than the morn,
Her happy laugh rang through the greenwood boughs ;-
She look'd so fair when, from the golden corn,
Tearing the wild flowers to adorn her brows;-
She look'd so fair when, calm, at dewy even
Watching the streamlet's waves go listless by ;
She look'd so fair beneath the moonlit heaven,
Her earnest face uplifted to the sky !
How fair, when o'er her thrilling lute she hung
Till from its chords unearthly music stole ! -
How fair, when,-whisperingly, her faltering tongue
Reveal'd her modest eloquence of soul !
How fair when, in the old cathedral aisle,
Upon her knees absorb'd in silent pray'r;
The poor still crowding round to court her smile,
As though a saint from heaven were kneeling there !
How fair, how passing fair, when in the dance
Her buoyant footsteps wild outflew the rest;
How fair, how passing fair, when at her glance
The proud grew humble, and the humble blest.
How fair !-And yet, too young to Love !-The spell
Was yet unspoken ! But the time may come !
Ah, hush !-ah, hush! Hear ye the funeral bell ?-
Yon nodding hearse hath borne her to her home !--
But it was no moment for a strain so doleful! The
Mereparks were in high spirits because about to be reunited
to their children and park palings; — 1, from the force of
sympathy. The tide took us in at dusk. The cheerful
lights of the city were gleaming in all directions; and
the familiar cries of an English crowd greeted us as a
friendly salutation.
On arriving at the hotel we were eager for dinner; hail-
ing as delicacies those much contemned simplicities of cod
and oyster sauce, — partridges and panada, — and other
items of English fare, which would make Paris die of an
indigestion. Merepark and I resolved to make a carouse
of it. I never felt in higher glee. I had a charming

autumn before me; first a week at the Royal Cottage,
next a capital party for pheasant shooting at Abbey;
and after roughing it for a few weeks, one feels that the
smooth sumptuosities of a lordly establishment are not
altogether unenviable.
As we were to start early, Lady Merepark wished me
good night when she retired from the dinner-table ; and
Merepark and I ordered a fresh bottle of claret, drew our
chairs closer to the fire, and began to give way to the feel-
ing of social communicativeness, which the first fire of
the season is sure to inspire. England is the only country in
the world where men shut out the chaste creation, and prose
over their wine ; which I conclude is what renders our
morals so superior to the residue of civilized Europe.
On that occasion, we indulged. We talked over adven-
tures of our old Downing Street days, and laughed over
events of more recent occurrence at Palermo, till we neither
of us saw any fault to find with our claret, - a proof that
we did not see very clearly. — Nay, having persuaded
Merepark, who though now on dry land, was half-seas-
over, to indulge me with a drinking song he had learnt at
-fair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea,
from a rollicking Spanish muleteer,—the room began to be
filled with shapes resembling those that clustered round the
loneliness of St. Anthony! – I have little doubt that
Byron, when galloping half-mad, - half-intoxicated, -
through the pine-woods, after solemnizing those terrible
obsequies of Shelley, felt much as I felt that night!
I know not what else prompted me to blaspheme as I
did, all that was good and fair, in my confidences to my
companion. If in Satan's memorandum-book be enregis-
tered all the abominable falsehoods interchanged between
man and man, on such occasions, the account will contain
many a grievous crime unwhipped of justice; -- Mere-
park's stupid maudlin wonder and applause encouraged me
to exaggeration, till I began to describe all sorts of imagi-
nary adventures with the graver of Callot and the periods
of poor little Matt. Lewis. – Heaven forgive me! -
At last, it was time to retire. The fire was burnt out,
-- the wine was drunk out, – the candles were about to

follow their example, and disappear also. — We went
laughing and pushing each other up stairs like two silly
schoolboys. — Everybody was in bed in the house, but
the drowsy waiter who had sat up to give us our bed
candles. When we reached No. 4, Merepark, after several
ineffectual attempts to turn the handle of the door, blun-
dered in, wishing me good night; while I proceeded towards
the end of the corridor, to the room where, before dinner,
I could just remember having washed my hands.
I suppose the wine I had drunk did not tend to in-
crease the clearness of my perceptions, - for, having
reached the one I conceived to be mine, I threw it open
with violence, - bursting in, to take possession of my
territories.
An exclamation of “ hush !” was the first sound that
saluted me; unnecessary, however, — for the startling
spectacle before me sufficed to paralyze my faculties. — It
was the chamber of death, — a gorgeous coffin, - two
gorgeous coffins, — with lights burning at the head, and
domestics in deep mourning, keeping watch over the
dead !
Sobered by the awful spectacle, and deeply ashamed of
my intrusion, I was retreating in haste. Already, the
waiter was at my heels ; with apologies, explanations, and
offers to conduct me to my own room.
“ They had said nothing about the body, thinking it
might be disagreeable to the lady to sleep under the same
roof with a corpse. But they could assure me it was only
there for the night. The funeral had arrived late in the
evening, and was to be embarked early in the morning for
Ireland. The bodies were on their way to my lord's
family vault in the county of Limerick.”
I had scarcely reached the threshold of my own door,
when the fellow made this communication. Staggering to
a chair, I had just strength to demand the name of the
family seat in the county of Limerick, - I had not
courage to pronounce that of the dead. —
“ I think the butler said Craig's Castle, sir ; but Lord
Wolverton has another seat in -”

my reach!

PEOPLE are apt to assert that nothing consoles us more
surely for the loss of those who are dear to us, than to
find their death a cause of general lamentation.
This may be the case with statesmen and heroes, whose
fame is in the breath of nations, but as regards a young
and delicate woman, the regrets showered upon her grave
serve only to increase the bitterness of the hour. I could
not take up a newspaper just then, but it was filled with
nauseous paragraphs relative to “ the bereaved Earl of
Wolverton,” or “ the late lovely and lamented Countess
of Wolverton.” — There was a detailed account of the
funeral ; - the “ affecting" embarkation of the bodies of
the mother and child. — All that the vile taste of the
times could perpetrate in the way of fine writing, was
twopence-a-lined by the Limerick Chronicle, announcing,
in letters half a yard long, the arrival of THE CORPSE —
(God! how I hate that word !) of the Son and Heir of
the ancient house of Wolverton; as if the little atom of
clay, deposited on a spot wherein it had never exercised
even its puny powers of vitality, were worthy of mention
in the same page with the wreck of all that was gentle, —
all that was beautiful ; - martyrized by the splendours

of life, as though her diamond tiara had been a crown of
thorns ! -
How often do the old fix their cold, callous, lustreless
gaze upon the young, either living or dead, as if they
were too young to have suffered ! — Blockheads ! — it is
only the young who are capable of real sorrow or real
enjoyment. In after life, the selfishness of human nature
supplies a styptic for every wound ; and Utilitarianism
has her pockets filled with Family Cerate, to salve it over.
We recall to mind that it is not worth while to harass our
few remaining years with regrets; that all will soon be
over. — We call this philosophy. - It is simply decadence
of mind under the growing ascendency of our material
nature.
In the sunshine of girl and boyhood, on the contrary,
the expanding blossoms of the soul are readily withered
by some sudden frost of human sorrow. To the very
young heart, the stab of the moral assassin conveys a
death-blow. At thirty, one calls in a surgeon; at

the rapier's edge. Though snatched from earth with

verton, were sufficient to have tinged a long after-life
with despair ! -
I knew it. I understood it. The gossips of society
observed, that autumn, at their splendid dessert-tables,
over their pine-apples and peaches, their claret and Bur-
gundy, or clustering round their blazing fires after dinner,
with due regard to their satin dresses and Mecklin lace, -
" What a shocking thing it was that poor Lady Wolverton
dying in child-bed so soon after her marriage! — Such a
beautiful creature, with such a charming house in town,
and such a fine place in Hampshire ! — Really everything
to make life desirable ! - I wonder whether Lord Wol-
verton will marry again ? ” — No one but Cecil Danby
knew what a glorious escape she had made from the
charming house in town, and fine place in Hampshire,
loathsome to her feelings !- that she had been tormented

into avenging herself upon an ingrate, by a brilliant
match, — then broken her heart, — offering up to Heaven
the atonement of her tears, and the sacrifice of penitence
and prayer ! — But she was at peace; yea! at peace.
Nothing could touch her further.
I hope and believe that I felt on the occasion ;- not
indeed with a sorrow even unto death, as in my brighter
days at Cintra ; — but when I struggled back into society
the following spring, scarcely a fellow at White's but
saluted me with “Halloo, Cis, my boy!- what on earth
have you been doing with yourself? - You look as if you
had come out of the tombs.”—
I answered not the tauntings of their levity. Of
what avail to admit to such men that I had been under-
going martyrdom ? - Had I displayed to them the wounds
of my agony, instead of being convinced, like the incredu-
lous Apostle, they would have persisted in their derision.
- I did well to hold my peace ! -
Will the world believe, - I mean the world, and not the
fine world, that these scorners attributed my anguish of
spirit to another death, which had occurred in the interval ?
— that of Lady Susan Danby.—They thought me anxious
lest Danby should marry again, and disappoint my ex-
pectations of inheritance by a son and heir !-
They were, perhaps, justified in the surmise ; for if my
despondency had another origin, the exultation of Lord
Ormington on the occasion was disgracefully genuine. It
was frightful to see with what glee he wore his broad hems
and black coat. I doubt whether any family event, since
Danby's wedding, had inspired him with such ardent
imaginings as poor Lady Susan's funeral. He saw appa-
ritions of crowned children rising out of her grave, like
those in the vision vouchsafed by the weird sisters to
Macbeth.
He was not, however, the only person who speculated
upon the event. Lady Harriet Vandeleur, now approach-
ing her fiftieth year, — who had adopted habits more
becoming her years than flirting or flippancy, began to
fire off batteries of tracts and serious books at the widower.
She was grown evangelical, much in the same spirit of

wrongheadedness she had once fancied herself an infidel;
and I suppose it was with a view of enlarging her sphere
of benevolence, that she thought the future rent-roll of the
future Lord Ormington might be advantageously added to
her jointure.
Danby was a person who took all things so quietly,
that I verily believe she thought herself making an im-
pression, by her strenuousness in advising him about the
bringing up of his daughter, and her officious counsels on
topics too sacred to be introduced irreverently into pages
like these ; when, in fact, he listened without hearing,
and bore with her impertinence, regarding the former
bosom friend of his mother as a sort of troublesome
aunt.
Lord Ormington, with his usual charity, chose to infer
that I promoted her Ladyship's views, in order to secure
myself from the new Arthur who might arise from a more
propitious alliance. He was mistaken. If I did not
vehemently oppose the foolish old woman's advances, it was
because I knew my brother too wise and too good to need
being placed upon his guard against giving such a successor
to the amiable Lady Susan. I was, in fact, too deeply
overpowered by a new and most unexpected affliction, to
trouble myself with her proceedings. An event occurred
which wrung from my lips the same exclamation as from
those of Trelawney, “ The world has lost its greatest man,
-1, my best friend !”
BYRON, who, to borrow the elegant quotation of Moore,
was fated to gather in Greece a crown of palm or cypress,
“o cipresso, o palma acquistar, "-Byron sank under the
influence of bad diet and a bad climate, at Missolonghi ;
or, to speak more truly, was bored to death by the practi-
calities of war-making, and the impracticability of the
Pbilhellenic Committee !
Such a destiny was perhaps assigned him in rebuke to
the pride of genius, which had said,
Seek out, less often sought than found,
A SOLDIER'S GRAVE, for thee the best,-
There look around and choose thy ground,
And take thy rest !
But who could have foreseen that one whom Shelley

The world raised its usual foolish clamour over the

when tarnished with a touch of human frailty, such as the

Bacon.

Bowed to the earth by these reiterated strokes of
affliction, I confined myself that season to the society
of my own family. I was fond of dining quietly with
Danby, in Connaught Place. My little niece was now
ten years old ; the most graceful and engaging creature
I ever beheld. All the leisure my brother could spare
from the duties of public life, he devoted to the education
of Jane. But the indulgence and adoration with which
he surrounded her, prevented her from imbibing the
pedantic formality usually affecting the mind of a girl
modelled by instruction unfitted for her sex. She was
gentle and childish in manners, as became her years; and
her singular intelligence rendered her a charming accession
to our family circle. Lord Ormington used to sit and
look upon her with a sort of wistful tenderness; as if
misdoubting that it was Danby's affection for her that
prevented his turning his thoughts as he ought to a second
marriage. But even he was under the influence of her
fascinating manners and disposition. Jane could do more
with her grandfather than any member of the family.
Of Julia, too, I was the frequent guest. But the
society of Herries was a pleasure I could have dis-
pensed with. My brother-in-law already wrote himself

Right Hon. and occupied an honourable and lucrative post
in the administration. But he was so completely be-
officed, so overwhelmed with business, — that the parish
dustman is more his own master. In conversation, it was
easy to see that he never gave one more than the attention
of the eye: in argument he fought with a reed. He dis-
dained conquest. He cared not for victory, unless in the
House or before the Privy Council. He had no longer a
part in the ordinary enjoyments of life ;- no longer
leisure to be glad or sorry ;— his very thoughts and
feelings were technical.-
The same harassing anxieties that worried poor Lon-
donderry out of his wits and Canning out of his life,
deprived Herries of all pretence to domestic comfort.
When a man rises in public life by abilities and industry,
his highborn colleagues take care that plenty of occu-
pation shall tax his abilities and industry to the utmost.
The consequence is that the distinctions which are to
them a stimulant to higher enjoyments, are to him a
burthen beyond endurance. Like the mules expiring in
the sunshine, while toiling with heavy loads of the precious
metals of the Cordilleras, Herries was overwhelmed with
the greatness of his charge. But for the earnest though
tranquil sympathy of his wife, he would have sunk under
his task. But the weariness of which he was conscious, he
of course inflicted upon others.
There was another member of the family from whose
company I humbly request the reader to spare all excla-
mations of surprise at finding me derive satisfaction, - to
wit, Lady Ormington !-
I never pretend to virtues beyond my calibre ; and shall
not waste my ink in affecting that it was filial piety, or
gratitude for the partiality lavished on my cockadehood,
which induced me to spend my evenings in her ladyship’s
drowsy boudoir, whenever I could induce Miss Richardson,
the toady, to solicit a holiday. Prematurely old, (for I
have seen women of threescore-years-and-ten far more
active and intelligent than my mother when wanting
fifteen years of that mortal allotment) — she would sit for
hours coaxing a little King Charles's spaniel, almost with-

out uttering a syllable; - laissant passer le temps, like
a tree motionless beside some rapid stream.
There we sat together; - musing, if not amusing ; in
the self-same chamber where my first survey in the glass
of my own beauties made a coxcomb of me for life, and
where I had seen her ladyship in powder and brocade
rehearse her worldly scenes of serious comedy. The gay
Axminster carpet had given way to one of more sombre
hue; and the great toilet glass was replaced by a highly-
varnished armoire, containing within its polished mahogany,
as a marble sarcophagus conceals unsightly bones, patent
medicines of every dye. — The old furniture,— the chairs
and tables, --(with the exception of the last new patent
super-easy easy-chair,) were the same as of old; grown
dingy and quizzical by contrast with the modern inven-
tions. — I fear the human lumber of the spot shared the
fate of its chairs and tables !
But it was on this very account I felt so comfortable
with my mother. We had progressed over hill and dale
together. Our selfishnesses were enlisted under the same
banner ; our interests were in common. And if we did
not love each other so passionately as some mothers and
their offspring, whose mutual affection vies with that of
the apes at the Zoological, each loved the other as much
as it loved any other created being besides its created
Self.
A warm room, excellent tea, and an amusing periodical,
always awaited me in Hanover Square ; and I suppose it
needs no other proof that I was in the wane of my rouéism,
that some of my pleasantest evenings in the summer of
1824, were spent by Lady Ormington's fireside,- ab-
sorbed in a book, - her ladyship absorbed in me. So long
as we can interest ourselves in a book, we are not much
to be pitied. Whoever can read with a warm, cordial,
and expansive spirit, becomes king, knight, pope, philoso-
pher, as he listeth:
Ad summum, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum.
For Jupiter, read of course, King George, — the Jove of
my Olympus.

The question has been made a text for prize essays
whether the king who dreams every night that he is a
beggar, or the beggar who dreams every night that he is a
king, be the happier man. On this point I have not made
up my mind. I seldom do make up my mind. All
questions are to me open questions. But I am satisfied
that among the faculties most to be dreaded for the young,
and most to be desired for the old, is a busy fancy.-
Reverie is the bane of twenty,- the antidote of four-
score. —
I was somewhat betwixt the two, when I found such
solace in dreaming away my evenings in Lady Ormington's
boudoir. It could not be that, like Tommy Moore,
I fancied her into some chivalry dame,
While I was her knight of the lance;
but I fancied her a thousand miles off, I know not where,
— and myself a thousand miles off, I know exactly
where.
I was living over again in the spirit, all I had already
lived in the flesh. I fancied myself hand to hand, heart
to heart, with Byron on the sands of the Lido, or among
the green pastures of Vévay; exchanging speculations on
those solemn topics on which men have speculated for four
thousand years, without having so much as determined
whether the tree of knowledge be a nonpareil or a crab. —
I fancied myself watching once more the lightning-like
coruscations of his genius, as, developed in word and
glance. I fancied myself mortified and irritated, as of old,
to see him scatter good seed upon the sterile rock ; defiling
his noble nature by dupehood to any artful woman
who flattered glozingly enough to win upon his con-
fidence.
Would that my fancies concerning him had gone no
further !- But I could not help sometimes figuring to
myself that lonely death-bed — that perplexed spirit,
and the bewilderment of soul of one who, having so
many accounts to balance with the world, found himself
suddenly overtaken by mists of night, alone upon the
barren mountain !-Had I been there — but why indulge
in those ever-recurring regrets! Cintra,—Venice, Mis-

solonghi, — stand in my memory like the crosses which in
Catholic countries signalize the site where murder hath been
done ; before which, pausing suddenly amid his everyday
routine of life, the peasant falls on his knees and prays,
— then abruptly resumes his plodding way and familiar
occupations.
I was beginning to live chiefly in the past. One is apt
to retire from the busy scene of life, like a Lord Cham-
berlain from the presence of Majesty, à reculons. At
thirty-five, one's pleasantest days lie in the rear. One
can't help looking back. I do not mean to say that some
men at five-and-thirty are not, like oaks and yews at a
century, still in their infancy. But a Cis Danby, at
fifteen a petit courrier des dames, and at twenty a roué,—
becomes at forty “a very foolish fond old man,” more
foolish and more fond than Lear at double the age.
Some years were still wanting, however, of my two-
score ; and there was no reason I should not enjoy them
in my own way. My own way was a way most peculiarly
my own. After undergoing two or three desperate heart-
quakes, the structure of one's feelings loses its equilibrium.
Cracks are perceptible on all sides, and one's mind exhibits
as perplexing a study for the curious in mathematics, as
the leaning Tower of Pisa.
The longer we float along the stream of life, the better
we understand the fable of the vessel of iron and the
vessel of clay; and if incompetent to convert our fragile
materials into sterner stuff, the further we recede from con-
tact with the hard and powerful, the better.
The hollowness of worldlings matters little, so long as
the inflation of youth and spirits enables one to be as hol-
low as they. But there are some natures, like certain
precious stones, of which the surface first acquires con-
sistency; crystallizing inwardly from the groundwork thus
matured, till the interstices being filled up with a bright
and adamantine substance, the gem becomes perfected.
Conscious that my own hollowness was gradually dis-
appearing under some such mineralogic process, — that,
as Nature abhors a vacuurn, she was good-naturedly fur-
nishing the empty bookshelves of my brain, and filling

Qui sait d'ailleurs,
with honey the waxen cells of my heart, - I withdrew
from the world, in order to favour her operations. Ab-
staining from the gaudy mobs and uproarious crowds of
public life, I adopted the philosophy of the poet.
Car hélas ! dans nos salons, où la foule est si grande,
Sous les brillans dehors d'un plaisir de commande,
Où sont nos cours ?-
Par des complimens faux l'on procède à des blâmes
Qu'on dit tous bas !
Croyez-moi ! restez seule avec huit cent mille âmes,
Qui n'en ont pas !
Between the eight hundred thousand souls who have no
soul, and any single soul equally deficient, the balance of
soul is pretty equal ; -- and so, retreating from the mul-
titude, I adhered to the boudoir, with its silent valetudi-
narian and stuffed lap-dog. Lady Ormington seldom in-
terrupted my studies. Her lucubrations were never very
luminous; but so long as she had remained gay enough
to be inconsistent, her vagaries were not unamusing.
People who blow hot and cold upon every subject under
discussion keep alive one's attention ; but the moment
they begin to blow tepid, they only added an unit to the
soul-less eight hundred thousand, whose tedious humdrum
psalmody puts to sleep half the better purposes of the
nobler spirits of this nether sphere.
The first indication I gave of the influence of such
companionship upon my mind, was by accepting a place
at Court. I refer my readers to the Red Book of 1825,
for the specification of my office. — My motives for re-
entering public life, I rise to explain.
As regards human nature in general, we have Milton's
authority for the servility of mankind. “ Half the world,”
saith he,“ prefers living under masters.”-As regards
human nature in my own person, I found the vindictive
hints of Lord Ormington that my inactivity in life arose
from views upon the inheritance of my brother, every day
more insupportable. Loving and respecting Danby as I
did, such inferences were sacrilegious in my ears; and I
was consequently grateful to the faithful friendship with
which his Majesty on his return from his tour, once more
tendered me an appointment in his household. I was
literally forced into the assumption of ambition, by having

incurred an odium inevitable among the many evils of an
origin obliquitous as mine.
Moreover, I felt capable of doing the state, or rather the
country, some service. I have dwelt modestly on my per-
sonal merits; conceiving them to be sufficiently manifested
in my deeds, — as the prowess of the lion is attested by
the whitening bones of his victims, heaped round his den.
But it becomes my duty to declare that my inborn graces
were now refined into a charm beyond the ordinary fasci-
nation of charmers, by much travel and much converse
with all that was best and brightest in civilized Europe.
To extinguish such acquirements in the obscurity of
private life, was not altogether fair to the country. The
true patriot sacrifices himself to the interests of his father-
land. If the sale of the Houghton collection of pictures
to a foreign power were an act of profanation, I felt that
I should “ stand accountant for as great a sin,” in with-
holding from public example those graces of mind and
manners, which so amply fulfilled the promise of my
cockadehood, and were so peculiarly adapted to adorn the
court and times of George IV.
The public hailed my appointment with satisfaction.
The Court was regarded by the tasteful as the head-quarters
of taste. The Court gave the law to the town, the town
to the country; a law from which there was no appeal.
There was a considerable lull just then in public affairs.
With the exception of Spain, (a country which having an
unlucky knack of matching its right hand against its left,
was, as usual, at fisticuffs with itself,) there was very
little fighting going on in Europe, except among the
patronesses of Almack's. The Holy Alliance still encircled
with its cordon sanitaire the kingdoms of the earth. The
three-cornered hats of the Jesuits had the best of it in
France; the cocked-hats of the standard footmen of the
Exclusives, in London. Fashion here, and Fanaticism
there, was the ascendant influence. The to kanov lay with
the Propaganda and the Patronesses, Madame and
Cardinal ~ ; the lull was, in short, producing the
same results as the becalming described by Coleridge, in
his fearful ballad of the “ Ancient Mariner.”

This was highly satisfactory to a man of my views and
pretensions. My notion of transcendent enjoyment is to
take the busiest life in the quietest way; to sit in a patent
reclining chair, and behold affairs of state delineated
before me, as by a camera-obscura. - I have no taste for
owlifying in a hollow tree. I detest a hermitage, whose
mossy couch is full of earwigs, and whose maple dish full
of raw carrots. My vegetables must be dressed à la maître
d'hôtel; and my mattresses, not my shirt, be of horsehair.
In other words, the Royal Cottage concentrated my sum-
mum bonum of human felicity.
The time is gone by for Kings to retire from the world
into the dreariness of a cloister. The example of that
wrongheaded Emperor Charles V. has convinced his royal
successors, that since in all communities, government ally
constituted, intrigues and factions must arise, it is less
worrying to arbitrate the pleasant squabbles of lords and
ladies, than the bitter animosities of frowsy monks.
I see my Public pricking up its ears, in earnest expect-
ation of the Diary of a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, as
a pendent to the Diary of the Lady. But I beg to assure
them, as poor old Barnet did me, that “ I am a gentleman
still; who, who says I am not a gentleman ?” They have
consequently nothing to expect as regards the privacy of
my royal master, more than they managed to learn by
peeping over the palings of his rustic palace. In my
opinion, the world has nothing to do with the leisure of
royalty.
My own leisure, however, is much at their service; and
I can assure them that its incidents multiplied most
agreeably the moment my pathway became established in
the perpetual sunshine of public distinction. Nobody who
has experienced the sensation, will dispute the pleasure
of being somebody. A somebody is of consequence to
everybody; and it is gratifying to feel that one's finger-
aches will create proper sympathy, and that if one chooses
to tell a long story people are obliged to listen to it. The
merits one derives from a little petty patronage, are beyond
computation. I cannot suppose that I grew either taller
or handsomer per force of the mere inscription of my

name in the Household. And yet, the way in which I
began to be whispered off into corners, and the enormous
increase of my satin-paper correspondence department,
might have convinced a man of less enlightened experience
that he had added a cubit to his stature.
It was about three months after accepting my appoint-
ment, that one night, at a charming party in George Street
but alas! dear reader, it is denied me to gratify you
with the relation. — At some moment or other of your life,
you have doubtless been proverbially invited to 6 give
the devil his due !_” I alone,- in all things fated to be
exceptional, - have just been peremptorily desired to give
my devil no more than his due !- My appointed hour is
come! -
In all manifestations of the fate of those supposed to
have made compacts with the evil one, from the
Dr. Faustus of nursery renown to Lewis's Wood Dæmon
or the Porte St. Martinisms of modern times, it may be
noticed that the moment the hero becomes surrounded with
those mundane joys for which he has perilled his salva-
sion is especially selected by the tempter for claiming the
penalty of his bond ! So is it with myself !-Just as I
find myself at ease in your company, just as I have
attained unbounded confidence in your discretion, — just
as I was about to entrust to you some of the choicest ad-
ventures of my life, - comes the fatal fiat of the printer.
The devil demands his own.- My sand has run out. -
The pages allotted me to fill, are expended. — No re-
prieve, - no renewal of my lease -- no sixth act to the
melodrama !—The brimstone and blue lights are blazing ;
and the green curtain waits only the signal of the prompter's
whistle, to conceal me for ever from your view.
But must it be indeed my last appearance ? —no hope
of being called for, like other favourite performers, when
the piece is at an end? —

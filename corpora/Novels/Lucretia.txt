PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
IT is somewhere about four years since I appeared
before the public as the writer of a fiction, which I then
intimated would probably be my last; but bad habits are
stronger than good intentions. When Fabricio, in his
nospital, resolved upon abjuring the vocation of the Poet,
he was in truth recommencing his desperate career by a
Farewell to the Muses:—I need not apply the allusion.
I must own, however, that there had long been a desire
in my mind to trace, in some work or other, the strange
and secret ways through which that Arch-ruler of Civiliza-
tion, familiarly called “Money,” insinuates itself into our
thoughts and motives, our hearts and actions; affecting
those who undervalue as those who overestimate its im-
portance; ruining virtues in the spendthrift no less than
engendering vices in the miser. But when I half implied
my farewell to the character of a novelist, I had imagined
that this conception might be best worked out upon the
stage. After some unpublished and imperfect attempts

toward so realizing my design, I found either that the
subject was too wide for the limits of the Drama, or that
I wanted that faculty of concentration which alone enables
the dramatist to compress multiform varieties into a very
limited compass. With this design, I desired to unite
sºme exhibition of what seems to me a principal vice in
the hot and emulous chase for happiness or fame, fortune
or knowledge, which is almost synonymous with the cant
phrase of “the March of Intellect,” in that crisis of so-
ciety to which we have arrived. The vice I allude to is
Impatience. That eager desire to press forward, not so
much to conquer obstacles as to elude them; that gam-
bling with the solemn destinies of life, seeking ever to set
success upon the chance of a die; that hastening from the
wish conceived to the end accomplished; that thirst after
quick returns to ingenious toil, and breathless spurrings
along short cuts to the goal, which we see everywhere
around us, from the Mechanics’ Institute to the Stock
Market,-beginning ir aducation with the primers of in-
fancy—deluging us w h “Philosophies for the Million,”
and “Sciences made Easy;” characterizing the books of
our writers, the speeches of our statesmen, no less than
the dealings of our speculators, seem, I confess, to me
to constitute a very diseased and very general symptom
of the times. I hold that the greatest friend to man is

labor; that knowledge without toil, if possible, were worth-
less; that toil in pursuit of knowledge is the best knowl-
edge we can attain; that the continuous effort for fame
is nobler than fame itself; that it is not wealth suddenly
acquired which is deserving of homage, but the virtues
which a man exercises in the slow pursuit of wealth, the
abilities so called forth, the self-denials so imposed: in a
word, that Labor and Patience are the true schoolmasters
on earth. While occupied with these ideas and this belief,
whether right or wrong, and slowly convinced that it was
only in that species of composition with which I was most
familiar that I could work out some portion of the plan
that I began to contemplate, I became acquainted with the
histories of two criminals, existing in our own age;—so
remarkable, whether from the extent and darkness of the
guilt committed—whether from the glittering accomplish-
ments and lively temper of the one, the profound knowl-
edge and intellectual capacities of the other—that the
examination and analysis of characters so perverted became
a study full of intense, if gloomy interest.
In these persons there appear to have been as few
redeemable points as can be found in Human Nature, so
far as such points may be traced in the kindly instincts
and generous passions which do sometimes accompany the
perpetration of great crimes, and, without excusing the

individual, vindicate the species. Yet, on the other hand,
their sanguinary wickedness was not the dull ferocity of
brutes; —it was accompanied with instruction and cul-
ture:—nay, it seemed to me, on studying their lives, and
pondering over their own letters, that through their culti-
vation itself we could arrive at the secret of the ruthless
and atrocious pre-eminence in evil these Children cf Night
had attained—that here the monster vanished into the
mortal, and the phenomena that seemed aberrations from
nature were explained.
I could not resist the temptation of reducing to a tale
the materials which had so engrossed my interest and
tasked my inquiries. And in this attempt, various in-
cidental opportunities have occurred, if not of completely
carrying out, still of incidentally illustrating, my earlier
design;– of showing the influence of Mammon upon our
most secret selves, of reproving the impatience which is
engendered by a civilization that with much of the good
brings all the evils of competition, and of tracing through-
out all the influences of early household life upon our
subsequent conduct and career. In such incidental bear-
ings the moral may doubtless be more obvious than in the
delineation of the darker and rarer crime which forms
the staple of my narrative. For in extraordinary guilt
we are slow to recognize ordinary warnings—we say to

the peaceful conscience, “This concerns thee not "-
whereas at each instance of familiar fault and common-
place error we own a direct and sensible admonition. Yet
in the portraiture of gigantic crime, poets have rightly
found their sphere, and fulfilled their destiny, of teachers.
Those terrible truths, which appall us in the guilt of Mac-
beth, or the villainy of Iago, have their moral uses not
less than the popular infirmities of Tom Jones, or the
everyday hypocrisy of Blifil
Incredible as it may seem, the crimes herein related
took place within the last seventeen years. There has
been no exaggeration as to their extent, no great depart-
ure from their details—the means employed, even that
which seems most far-fetched (the instrument of the poi-
soned ring), have their foundation in literal facts. Nor
have I much altered the social position of the criminals,
nor in the least overrated their attainments and intel-
ligence. In those more salient essentials, which will most,
perhaps, provoke the reader's incredulous wonder, I nar-
rate a history, not invent a fiction.* All that romance
* These criminals were not, however, in actual life, as in the
novel, intimates and accomplices. Their crimes were of similar
character, effected by similar agencies, and committed at dates
which embrace their several careers of guilt within the same
period; but I have no authority to suppose that the one was known
to the other.

which our own time affords is not more the romance than
the philosophy of the time. Tragedy never quits the
world—it surrounds us everywhere. We have but to
look, wakeful and vigilant, abroad, and from the age of
Pelops to that of Borgia, the same crimes, though under
different garbs, will stalk on our paths. Each age com-
prehends in itself specimens of every virtue and every
vice which has ever inspired our love or moved our
horror.

LUCRETIA, on THE CHILDREN of NIGRT, was begur
simultaneously with THE CAxtons, a FAMILY PICTURE.
The two fictions were intended as pendants; both serving,
among other collateral aims and objects, to show the in-
fluence of home education—of early circumstance and

was completed and published before THE CAxTons. The
moral design of the first was misunderstood and assailed;
that of the last was generally acknowledged and approved;
the moral design in both was nevertheless precisely the
sarie. But in one it was sought through the darker side
of human nature, in the other, through the more sunny
and cheerful—one shows the evil, the other the salutary
influences of early circumstance and training. Necessarily
therefore the first resorts to the tragic elements of awe
and distress—the second to the comic elements of humor
and agreeable emotion. These differences serve to explain
the different reception that awaited the two, and may

teach us how little the real conception of an author is
known, and how little it is cared for: we judge—not by
the purpose he conceives, but according as the impressions
he effects are pleasurable or painful. But while I cannot
acquiesce in much of the hostile criticism this fiction pro-
duced at its first appearance, I readily allow that, as a
mere question of art, the story might have been improved
in itself, and rendered more acceptable to the reader, by
diminishing the gloom of the catastrophe. In this edition
I have endeavored to do so; and the victim whose fate in
the former cast of the work most revolted the reader, as a
violation of the trite but amiable law of Poetical Justice,
is saved from the hands of THE CHILDREN or Night.
Perhaps—whatever the faults of this work—it equals most
of its companions in the sustainment of interest, and
in that coincidence between the gradual development of
motive or passion, and the sequences of external events
constituting plot, which mainly distinguish the physical
awe of tragedy from the coarse horrors of melodrama.
I trust at least that I shall now find few readers who will
not readily acknowledge that the delineation of crime has
only been employed for the grave and impressive purpose
which brings it within the due province of the poet, as an
element of terror and a warning to the heart. But should

the sanction of its somber materials by the example of

narrative is derived.

PROLOGUE TO PART THE FIRST.
In an apartment at Par's, one morning, during the
Reign of Terror, a man, whose age might be somewhat
under thirty, sate before a table covered with papers, ar-
ranged and labeled with the methodical precision of a
mind fond of order and habituated to business. Behind
him rose a tall book-case, surmounted with a bust of
Robespierre, and the shelves were filled chiefly with works
of a scientific character; among which the greater number
were on chemistry and medicine. There were to be seen
also many rare books on alchemy, the great Italian his-
torians, some English philosophical treatises, and a few
MSS. in Arabic. The absence, from this collection, of
the stormy literature of the day, seemed to denote that the
owner was a quiet student living apart from the strife and
passions of the Revolution. This supposition was, how-

ever, disproved by certain papers on the table, which were
formally and laconically labeled “Reports on Lyons,” and
by packets of letters in the handwritings of Robespierre
and Couthon. At one of the windows, a young boy was
earnestly engaged in some occupation, which appeared to
excite the curiosity of the person just described; for this
last, after examining the child's movements for a few mo-
ments with a silent scrutiny, that betrayed but little of the
half-complacent, half-melancholy affection with which busy
man is apt to regard idle childhood, rose noiselessly from
his seat, approached the boy, and looked over his shoulder
unobserved. In a crevice of the wood by the window, a
huge black spider had formed his web; the child had just
discovered another spider, and placed it in the meshes;
he was watching the result of his operations. The intru-
sive spider stood motionless in the midst of the web, as if
fascinated. The rightful possessor was also quiescent;
but a very fine ear might have caught a low humming
sound, which probably augured no hospitable intentions to
the invader. Anon, the stranger insect seemed suddenly
to awake from its amaze; it evinced alarm, and turned to
fly; the huge spider darted forward—the boy uttered a
chuckle of delight. The man's pale lip curled into a sin-
ister sneer, and he glided back to his seat. There, leaning
his face on his hand, he continued to contemplate the
child. That child might have furnished to an artist a
fitting subject for fair and blooming infancy. His light
hair, tinged deeply, it is true, with red, hung in sleek and
glittering abundance down his neck and shoulders. His

features, seen in profile, were delicately and almost femi-
ninely proportioned; health glowed on his cheek, and his
form, slight though it was, gave promise of singular ac-
tivity and vigor. His dress was fantastic, and betrayed
the taste of some fondly foolish mother; but the fine linen,
trimmed with lace, was rumpled and stained, the velvet
jacket unbrushed, the shoes soiled with dust; —slight
tokens these of neglect—but serving to show that the
foolish fondness which had invented the dress had not
of late presided over the toilet.
“Child,” said the man, first in French; and observing
that the boy heeded him not—“child,” he repeated in
English, which he spoke well, though with a foreign accent
– “child I?"
The boy turned quickly.
“Has the great spider devoured the small one?”
“No, sir,” said the boy, coloring; “the small one has
had the best of it.” The tone and heightened complexion
of the child seemed to give meaning to his words—at least,
so the man thought, for a slight frown passed over his
high, thoughtful brow.
“Spiders, then,” he said, after a short pause, “are diſ.
ferent from men; with us, the small do not get the better
of the great. Hum! do you still miss your mother?”
“Oh, yes!” and the boy advanced eagerly to the table.
“Well, you will see her once again.”
“When ºn

ders.” The child looked irresolute and disinclined to
obey; but a stern and terrible expression gathered slowly
over the man's face; and the boy, growing pale as he
remarked it, crept back to the window.
The father, for such was the relation the owner of the
room bore to the child, drew paper and ink toward him,
and wrote for some minutes rapidly. Then starting up, he
glanced at the clock, took his hat and cloak, which lay on
a chair beside, drew up the collar of the mantle till it
almost concealed his countenance, and said—“Now, boy,
come with me; I have promised to show you an execution.
I am going to keep my promise. Come!”
The boy clapped his hands with joy; and you might see
then, child as he was, that those fair features were capable
of a cruel and ferocious expression. The character of the
whole face changed. He caught up his gay cap and plume,
and followed his father into the streets.
Silently the two took their way toward the Barrière du
Trône. At a distance, they saw the crowd growing thick
and dense, as throng after throng hurried past them, and
the dreadful guillotine rose high in the light blue air. As
they came into the skirts of the mob, the father, for the
first time, took his child's hand. “I must get you a good
place for the show,” he said, with a quiet smile.
There was something in the grave, staid, courteous, yet
haughty bearing of the man, that made the crowd give
way as he passed. They got near the dismal scene, and
obtained entrance into a wagon already crowded with
tager spectators.


## p. 21 (#27) ##############################################

And now they heard at a distance the harsh and lumber.
ing roll of the tumbril that bore the victims, and the tramp
of the horses which guarded the procession of death. The
boy's whole attention was absorbed in expectation of the
spectacle, and his ear was, perhaps, less accustomed to
French, though born and reared in France, than to the
language of his mother's lips—and she was English: thus
he did not hear or heed certain observations of the by-
standers, which made his father's pale cheek grow paler.
“What is the batch to-day?" quoth a butcher in the
wagon.
“Scarce worth the baking—only two:—but one, they
say, is an aristocrat—a ci-devant marquis,” answered a
carpenter.
“Ahl a marquis!— Bonſ—And the other?”
“Only a dancer; but a pretty one, it is true: I could
pity her, bnt she is English.” And as he pronounced the
last word, with a tone of inexpressible contempt, the
butcher spat, as if in nausea.
“Mort diable! a spy of Pitt's, no doubt. What did
they discover?”
A man better dressed than the rest, turned round with a
smile, and answered—“Nothing worse than a lover, I be-
lieve; but that lover was a proscrit. The ci-devant mar-
quis was caught disguised in her apartment. She betrayed
for him a good easy friend of the people, who had long
loved her, and revenge is sweet.”
The man whom we have accompanied nervously twitched
up the collar of his cloak, and his compressed lips told

that he felt the anguish of the laugh that circled round
him. -
“They are coming! There they are 1" cried the boy in
ecstatic excitement.
“That's the way to bring up citizens,” said the butcher,
patting the child's shoulder, and opening a still better
view for him at the edge of the wagon.
The crowd now abruptly gave way. The tumbril was
in sight. A man, young and handsome, standing erect and
with folded arms in the fatal vehicle, looked along the
mob with an eye of careless scorn. Though he wore the
dress of a workman, the most unpracticed glance could
detect, in his mien and bearing, one of the hated noblesse,
whose characteristics came out even more forcibly at the
hour of death. On the lip was that smile of gay and
insolent levity, on the brow that gallant if reckless con-
tempt of physical danger, which had signalized the hero-
coxcombs of the old régime. Even the rude dress was
worn with a certain air of foppery, and the bright hair
was carefully adjusted as if for the holiday of the heads-
man. As the eyes of the young noble wandered over the
fierce faces of that horrible assembly, while a roar of hide-
ous triumph answered the look, in which for the last time
the gentilhomme spoke his scorn of the canaille, the
child's father lowered the collar of his cloak, and slowly
raised his hat from his brow. The eye of the marquis
rested upon the countenance thus abruptly shown to him,
and which suddenly became individualized among the
crowd,—that eye instantly lost its calm contempt. A

snudder passed visibly over his frame, and his cheek grew
blanched with terror. The mob saw the change, but not
the cause, and loud and louder rose their triumphant yell.
The sound recalled the pride of the young noble;—he
started—lifted his crest erect, and sought again to meet
the look which had appalled him. But he could no longer
single it out among the crowd. Hat and cloak once more
hid the face of the foe, and crowds of eager heads inter-
cepted the view. The young marquis's lips muttered; he
bent down, and then the crowd caught sight of his com-
panion, who was being lifted up from the bottom of the
tumbril, where she had flung herself in horror and despair.
The crowd grew still in a moment, as the pale face of one,
familiar to most of them, turned wildly from place to place
in the dreadful scene, vainly and madly through its silence
imploring life and pity. How often had the sight of that
face, not then pale and haggard, but wreathed with rosy
smiles, sufficed to draw down the applause of the crowded
theater—how, then, had those breasts, now fevered by the
thirst of blood, held hearts spell-bound by the airy move-
ments of that exquisite form writhing now in no stage-
mime agonyl Plaything of the city—minion to the light
amusement of the hour—frail child of Cytherea and the
Graces, what relentless fate has conducted thee to the
shambles? Butterfly of the summer, why should a nation
rise to break thee upon the wheel? A sense of the mock-
ery of such an execution, of the horrible burlesque that
would sacrifice to the necessities of a mighty people so
slight an offering, made itself felt among the crowd. There

was a low murmur of shame and indignation. The dan-
gerous sympathy of the mob was perceived by the officer in
attendance. Hastily he made the sign to the headsman,
and, as he did so, a child's cry was heard in the English
tongue—“Mother—mother!” The father's hand grasped
the child's arm with an iron pressure; the crowd swam
before the boy's eyes; the air seemed to stifle him, and
become blood-red; only through the hum, and the tramp,
and the roll of the drums, he heard a low voice hiss in his
ear—“Learn how they perish who betray me!”
As the father said these words, again his face was bare,
and the woman whose ear, amid the dull insanity of fear,
had caught the cry of her child's voice, saw that face, and
fell back insensible in the arms of the headsman.

A FAMILY GROUP.
ONE July evening, at the commencement of the presen'
century, several persons were somewhat picturesquely
grouped along an old-fashioned terrace, which skirted the
garden side of a manor-house that had considerable preten-
sions to baronial dignity. The architecture was of the
most enriched and elaborate style belonging to the reign
of James the First: the porch, opening on the terrace,
with its mullion window above, was incased with pilasters
and reliefs, at once ornamental and massive; and the large
square tower in which it was placed was surmounted by a
stone falcon, whose talons griped fiercely a scutcheon
blazoned with the five-pointed stars which heralds recog-
nize as the arms of St. John. On either side this tower
extended long wings, the dark brickwork of which was
relieved with noble stone casements and carved pediments;
the high roof was partially concealed by a balustrade, per-
forated not inelegantly into arabesque designs; and what
architects call “the sky line” was broken with imposing
effect by tall chimney shafts, of various form and fashion.
These wings terminated in angular towers, similar to the
center, though kept duly subordinate to it both in size and
decoration, and crowned with stone cupolas. A low balus-

trade, of later date than that which adorned the roof,
relieved by vases and statues, bordered the terrace, from
which a double flight of steps descended to a smooth lawn,
intersected by broad gravel walks, shadowed by vast and
stately cedars, and gently and gradually mingling with the
wilder scenery of the park, from which it was only divided
by a ha-ha.
Upon the terrace, and under cover of a temporary awn-
ing, sate the owner, Sir Miles St. John, of Laughton, a
comely old man, dressed with faithful precision to the cos-
tume which he had been taught to consider appropriate
to his rank of gentleman, and which was not yet wholly
obsolete and eccentric. His hair, still thick and luxuriant,
was carefully powdered, and collected into a club behind.
His nether man attired in gray breeches and pearl-colored
silk stockings; his vest of silk, opening wide at the breast,
and showing a profusion of frill, slightly sprinkled with the
pulvilio of his favorite martinique; his three-cornered hat,
placed on a stool at his side, with a gold-headed crutch-
cane,—hat made rather to be carried in the hand than
worn on the head, the diamond in his shirt-breast, the dia-
mond on his finger, the ruffles at his wrist-all bespoke
the gallant, who had chatted with Lord Chesterfield, and
supped with Mrs. Clive. On a table before him were
placed two or three decanters of wine, the fruits of the
season, an enameled snuff-box, in which was set the por-
trait of a female—perhaps the Chloe or Phillis of his early
love-ditties; a lighted taper, a small china jar containing
tobacco, and three or four pipes of homely clay, for cherry.

sticks and meerschaums were not then in fashion; and Sir
Miles St. John, once a gay and sparkling beau, now a
popular country gentleman, great at county meetings and
sheep-shearing festivals, had taken to smoking, as in har-
mony with his bucolic transformation. An old setter lay
dozing at his feet; a small spaniel—old, too—was saunter-
ing lazily in the immediate neighborhood, looking gravely
out for such stray bits of biscuit as had been thrown forth
to provoke him to exercise, and which hitherto had escaped
his attention. Half seated, half reclined on the balustrade,
apart from the Baronet, but within reach of his conversa-
'tion, lolled a man in the prime of life, with an air of un-
mistakable and sovereign elegance and distinction. Mr.
Vernon was a guest from London: and the London man,
the man of clubs, and dinners, and routs—of noon loung-
ings through Bond Street, and nights spent with the
Prince of Wales, seemed stamped not more upon the care-
ful carelessness of his dress, and upon the worn expres-
sion of his delicate features, than upon the listless ennui,
which, characterizing both his face and attitude, appeared
to take pity on himself for having been entrapped into the
country. .
Yet we should convey an erroneous impression of Mr.
Vernon, if we designed, by the words “listless ennui,” to
depict the slumberous insipidity of more modern affecta-
tion—it was not the ennui of a man to whom ennui is
habitual; it was rather the indolent prostration that fills
up the intervals of excitement. At that day, the word
"blasé” was unknown; men had not enough sentiment

for satiety. There was a kind of Bacchanalian fury in the
life led by those leaders of fashion among whom Mr. Wer-
non was not the least distinguished; it was a day of deep
drinking, of high play, of jovial reckless dissipation — of
strong appetite for fun and riot—of four-in-hand coach-
manship—of prize-fighting—of a strange sort of barbar-
ous manliness, that strained every nerve of the constitution;
a race of life, in which three-fourths of the competitors
died half way in the hippodrome. What is now the
Dandy was then the Buck; and something of the Buck,
though subdued by a chaster taste than fell to the ordi-
nary members of his class, was apparent in Mr. Vernon's
costume as well as air. Intricate folds of muslin, arranged
in prodigious bows and ends, formed the cravat, which
Brummell had not yet arisen to reform; his hat of a very
peculiar shape, low at the crown and broad at the brim,
was worn with an air of devil-me-care defiance; his watch-
chain, garnished with a profusion of rings and seals, hung
low from his white waistcoat; and the adaptation of his
nankin inexpressibles to his well-shaped limbs was a mas-
ter-piece of art. His whole dress and air was not what
could properly be called foppish—it was rather what at
that time was called “rakish.” Few could so closely ap-
proach vulgarity without being vulgar: of that privileged
few, Mr. Vernon was one of the elect. Further on, and
near the steps descending into the garden, stood a man in
an attitude of profound abstraction; his arms folded, his
eyes bent on the ground, his brows slightly contracted;
his dress was a plain black surtout, and pantaloons of the

same color; something both in the fashion of the dress,
and still more in the face of the man, bespoke the for-
eigner
Sir Miles St. John was an accomplished person for that
time of day; he had made the grand tour; he had bought
pictures and statues; he spoke and wrote well in the mod-
ern languages; and being rich, hospitable, social, and not
averse from the reputation of a patron, he had opened
his house freely to the host of emigrants whom the French
Revolution had driven to our coasts. Olivier Dalibard, a
man of considerable learning and rare scientific attain-
ments, had been tutor in the house of the Marquis de
G
the old baronet. The marquis and his family had been
among the first emigrés at the outbreak of the Revolu-
tion. The tutor had remained behind; for at that time
no danger appeared to threaten those who pretended to
no other aristocracy than that of letters. Contrary, as he
said, with repentant modesty, to his own inclinations, he
had been compelled, not only for his own safety, but for
that of his friends, to take some part in the subsequent
events of the Revolution—a part far from sincere, though
so well had he simulated the patriot, that he had won the
personal favor and protection of Robespierre; nor till the
full of that virtuous exterminator had he withdrawn from
, a French nobleman, known many years before to
the game of politics, and effected in disguise his escape to
England As, whether from kindly or other motives, he
had employed the power of his position in the esteem of
Robespierre, to save certain noble heads from the guil-

lotine—among others, the two brothers of the Marquis de
G , he was received with grateful welcome by his for-
mer patrons, who readily pardoned his career of Jacobin-
ism, from their belief in his excuses, and their obligations
to the services which that very career had enabled him to
render to their kindred. Olivier Dalibard had accom-
panied the marquis and his family in one of the frequent
visits they paid to Laughton; and when the marquis
finally quitted England, and fixed his refuge at Vienna,
with some connections of his wife's, he felt a lively satisfac-
tion at the thought of leaving his friend honorably, if un-
ambitiously, provided for, as secretary and librarian to Sir
Miles St. John. In fact, the scholar, who possessed con-
siderable powers of fascination, had won no less favor with
the English baronet than he had with the French dictator.
He played well both at chess and backgammon; he was
an extraordinary accountant; he had a variety of informa-
tion upon all points, that rendered him more convenient
than any cyclopedia in Sir Miles's library; and as he spoke
both English and Italian with a correctness and fluency
extremely rare in a Frenchman, he was of considerable
service in teaching languages to (as well as directing the
general literary education of) Sir Miles's favorite niece—
whom we shall take an early opportunity to describe at
length.
Nevertheless, there had been one serious obstacle to
Dalibard's acceptance of the appointment offered to him
by Sir Miles. Dalibard had under his charge a young
orphan boy of some ten or twelve years old—a boy whom

Sir Miles was not long in suspecting to be the scholar's
son. This child had come from France with Dalibard,
and (while the marquis's family were in London) remained
under the eye and care of his guardian or father, which-
ever was the true connection between the two. But this
superintendence became impossible, if Dalibard settled in
IIampshire with Sir Miles St. John and the boy remained
in London; nor, though the generous old gentleman of-
fered to pay for the child's schooling, would Dalibard
consent to part with him. At last, the matter was ar-
ranged: the boy was invited to Laughton on a visit, and
was so lively, yet so well mannered, that he became a
favorite, and was now fairly quartered in the house with
his reputed father: and not to make an unnecessary mys-
tery of this connection, such was in truth the relationship
between Olivier Dalibard and Honoré Gabriel Warney—a
name significant of the double and illegitimate origin—a
French father, an English mother; dropping, however, the
purely French appellation of Honoré, he went familiarly
by that of Gabriel. Half way down the steps stood the
lad, pencil and tablet in hand, sketching. Let us look
over his shoulder. It is his father's likeness—a counte-
nance in itself not very remarkable at the first glance, for
the features were small, but, when examined, it was one
that most persons, women especially, would have pro-
nounced handsome, and to which none could deny the
higher praise of thought and intellect. A native of Prov-
ence, with some Italian blood in his veins—for his grand.
father, a merchant of Marseilles, had married into a Flor.

entine family settled at Leghorn—the dark complexion,
common with those in the south, had been subdued,
probably by the habits of the student, into a bronzed and
steadfast paleness, which seemed almost fair by the con-
trast of the dark hair which he wore unpowdered, and the
still darker brows which hung thick and prominent over
clear gray eyes. Compared with the features, the skull
was disproportionally large, both behind and before; and
a physiognomist would have drawn conclusions more favor-
able to the power than the tenderness of the Provençal's
character, from the compact closeness of the lips and the
breadth and massiveness of the iron jaw. But the son's
sketch exaggerated every feature, and gave to the expres-
sion a malignant and terrible irony, not now, at least,
apparent in the quiet and meditative aspect. Gabriel
himself, as he stood, would have been a more tempting
study to many an artist. It is true that he was small for
his years; but his frame had a vigor in its light propor-
tions, which came from a premature and almost adolescent
symmetry of shape and muscular development. The coun-
tenance, however, had much of effeminate beauty; the
long hair reached the shoulders, but did not curl; straight,
fine, and glossy as a girl's, and, in color, of the pale au-
burn, tinged with red, which rarely alters in hue as child-
hood matures to man; the complexion was dazzlingly
clear and fair. Nevertheless, there was something so hard
in the lip, so bold, though not open, in the brow, that the
girlishness of complexion, and even of outline, could not
leave, on the whole, an impression of effeminacy. All the

hereditary keenness and intelligence were stamped upon
his face at that moment; but the expression had also a
large share of the very irony and malice which he had
conveyed to his caricature. The drawing itself was won-
derfully vigorous and distinct, showing great artistic prom-
ise, and done with the rapidity and ease which betrayed
practice. Suddenly his father turned, and with as sudden
a quickness the boy concealed his tablet in hiºvest; and
the sinister expression of his face smoothed into a timor-
ous smile, as his eye encountered Dalibard's. The father
beckoned to the boy, who approached with alacrity. “Ga-
briel,” whispered the Frenchman, in his own tongue,
“where are they at this moment?”
The boy pointed silently toward one of the cedars.
Dalibard mused an instant, and then slowly descending
the steps, took his noiseless way over the smooth turf
toward the tree. Its boughs drooped low and spread
wide; and not till he was within a few paces of the spot,
could his eye perceive two forms, seated on a bench under
the dark green canopy. He then paused and contem-
plated them.
The one was a young man, whose simple dress and sub-
dued air strongly contrasted the artificial graces and the
modish languor of Mr. Vernon; but though wholly with-
out that nameless distinction which sometimes charac-
terizes those conscious of pure race, and habituated to
the atmosphere of courts, he had at least Nature's stamp
of aristocracy in a form eminently noble, and features of
manly, but surpassing beauty, which were not rendered

less engaging by an expression of modest timidity. He
seemed to be listening with thoughtful respect to his com-
panion, a young female by his side, who was speaking to
him with an earnestness visible in her gestures and her
animated countenance. And though there was much to
notice in the various persons scattered over the scene, not
one, perhaps—not the graceful Vernon—not the thought-
ful scholar nor his fair-haired hard-lipped son—not even
the handsome listener she addressed—no, not one there
would so have arrested the eye, whether of a physiogno-
mist or a casual observer, as that young girl—Sir Miles St.
John's favorite niece and presumptive heiress.
But as, at that moment, the expression of her face dif-
fered from that habitual to it, we defer its description.
“Do not”—such were her words to her companion,-
“do not alarm yourself by exaggerating the difficulties; do
not even contemplate them—those be my care. Mainwaring,
when I loved you, when, seeing that your diffidence or your
pride forbade you to be the first to speak, I overstepped
the modesty or the dissimulation of my sex; when I said,
—“Forget that I am the reputed heiress of Jeaughton; see
in me but the faults and merits of the human being, of the
wild unregulated girl; see in me but Lucretia Clavering'
(here her cheeks blushed, and her voice sank into a lower
and more tremulous whisper), ‘and love her if you can l'—
When I went thus far, do not think I had not measured
all the difficulties in the way of our union, and felt that I
could surmount them.” -
“But,” answered Mainwaring, hesitatingly, “can you

conceive it possible that your uncle ever will consent? Is
not pride—the pride of family—almost the leading at-
tribute of his character 7 Did he not discard your mother
—his own sister—from his house and heart, for no other
offense but a second marriage, which he deemed beneath
her? IIas he ever even consented to see, much less to
receive, your half sister—the child of that marriage? Is
not his very affection for you interwoven with his pride in
you, with his belief in your ambition? Has he not sum-
moned your cousin, Mr. Vernon, for the obvious purpose
of favoring a suit which he considers worthy of you, and
which, if successful, will unite the two branches of his
ancient house? How is it possible that he can ever hear
without a scorn and indignation which would be fatal to
your fortunes, that your heart has presumed to choose,
in William Mainwaring, a man without ancestry or ca-
reer?”
“Not without career!” interrupted Lucretia, proudly
“Do you think, if you were master of Laughton, that your
career would not be more brilliant than that of yon in-
dolent luxurious coxcomb 7 Do you think that I could
have been poor-hearted enough to love you, if I had not
recognized in you energies and talents that correspond
with my own ambition? For I am ambitious, as you
know, and therefore my mind, as well as my heart, went
with my love for you.”
“Ah, Lucretial but can Sir Miles St. John see my
future rise in my present obscurity?”
“I do not say that he can, or will; but if you love me,

we can wait. Do not fear the rivalry of Mr. Wernon. I
shall know how to free myself from so tame a peril. We
can wait—my uncle is old—his habits preclude the chance
of a much longer life—he has already had severe attacks.
We are young, dear Mainwaring: what is a year or two
to those who hope 7” -
Mainwaring's face fell, and a displeasing chill passed
through his veins. Could this young creature, her uncle's
petted and trusted darling, she who should be the soother
of his infirmities, the prop of his age, the sincerest mourner
at his grave, weigh coldly thus the chances of his death,
and point at once to the altar and the tomb?
He was saved from the embarrassment of reply by Dali-
bard's approach. -
“More than half an hour absent,” said the scholar in
his own language, with a smile, and drawing out his watch,
he placed it before their eyes; “do you not think that all
will miss you? Do you suppose, Miss Clavering, that
your uncle has not, ere this, asked for his fair niece?
Come, and forestall him.” He offered his arm to Lucretia
as he spoke. She hesitated a moment, and then, turning
to Mainwaring, held out her hand: he pressed it, though
scarcely with a lover's warmth; and as she walked back
to the terrace with Dalibard, the young man struck slowly
into the opposite direction, and passing by a gate, over a
foot-bridge, that led from the ha-ha into the park, bent his
way toward a lake which gleamed below at some distance,
half concealed by groves of venerable trees, rich with the
prodigal boughs of summer. Meanwhile, as they passed

toward the house, Dalibard, still using his native tongue,
thus accosted his pupil:
“You must pardon me if I think more of your interests
than you do; and pardon me no less if I encroach on
your secrets and alarm your pride. This young man—can
you be guilty of the folly of more than a passing caprice
for his society? of more than the amusement of playing
with his vanity? Even if that be all, beware of entangling
yourself in your own meshes.”
“You do, in truth, offend me,” said Lucretia, with calm
haughtiness, “and you have not the right thus to speak
to me.”
“Not the right,” repeated the Provençal, mournfully;
“not the right!—then, indeed, I am mistaken in my pupil.
Do you conceive that I would have lowered my pride to
remain here as a dependent, that conscious of attainments,
and perhaps of abilities, that should win their way, even in
exile, to distinction, I would have frittered away my life in
these rustic shades, if I had not formed in you a deep and
absorbing interest; in that interest I ground my right to
warn and counsel you. I saw, or fancied I saw, in you a
mind congenial to my own—a mind above the frivolities of
your sex—a mind, in short, with the grasp and energy of a
man's. You were then but a child; you are scarcely yet a
woman; yet have I not given to your intellect the strong
food on which the statesmen of Florence fed their pupil
princes; or the noble Jesuits, the noble men who were
destined to extend the secret empire of the imperishable
Loyola f"

“You gave me the taste for a knowledge rare in my
sex, I own,” answered Lucretia, with a slight tone of re-
gret in her voice; “and in the knowledge you have com-
municated I felt a charm that, at times, seems to me to be
only fatal. You have confounded in my mind evil and
good, or, rather, you have left both good and evil as dead
ashes, as the dust and cinder of a crucible. You have
made intellect the only conscience. Of late, I wish that
my tutor had been a village priest!”
“Of late 1 since you have listened to the pastorals of
that meek Corydon 7"
“Dare you despise him—and for what? that he is good
and honest?”
“I despise him not because he is good and honest, but
because he is of the common herd of men, without aim or
character. And it is for this youth that you will sacrifice
your fortunes, your ambition, the station you were born to
fill and have been reared to improve—this youth in whom
there is nothing but the lap-dog's merit—sleekness and
beauty. Ay, frown, the frown betrays you—you love
hi:.1 !”
“And if I do?” said Lucretia, raising her tall form to its
utmost height, and haughtily facing her inquisitor. “And
if I do, what then 7 Is he unworthy of me? Converse
with him, and you will find that the noble form conceals as
high a spirit. He wants but wealth; I can give it to him.
If his temper is gentle, I can prompt and guide it to fame
and power. He, at least, has education, and eloquence,
and mind. What has Mr. Vernon 7”

* Mr. Vernon! I did not speak of him 1"
Lucretia gazed hard upon the Provençal's countenance
—gazed with that unpitying air of triumph with which a
woman who detects a power over the heart she does not
desire to conquer, exults in defeating the reasons that
heart appears to her to prompt. “No,” she said, in a
calm voice, to which the venom of secret irony gave sting-
ing significance—“no, you spoke not of Mr. Vernon; you
thought that if I looked round—if I looked nearer—I
might have a fairer choice.”
“You are cruel—you are unjust,” said Dalibard, falter-
ingly. “If I once presumed for a moment, have I re-
peated my offense ? But,” he added, hurriedly, “in me–
much as you appear to despise me—in me, at least, you
would have risked none of the dangers that beset you if
you seriously set your heart on Mainwaring.”
“You think my uncle would be proud to give my hand
to Monsieur Olivier Dalibard ”
“I think and I know,” answered the Provençal, gravely,
and disregarding the taunt, “that if you had deigned to
render me—poor exile that I am l—the most enviable of
men, you had still been the heiress of Laughton.”
“So you have said and urged,” said Lucretia, with
evident curiosity in her voice; “yet how, and by what art
—wise and subtle as you are—could you have won my
uncle’s consent?”
“That is my secret,” returned Dalibard gloomily: “and
since the madness I indulged is forever over—since I have
so schooled my heart that nothing, despite your sarcasm,

save an affectionate interest which I may call paternal,
rests there—let us pass from this painful subject. Oh,
my dear pupil, be warned in time ! know love for what it
really is, in the dark and complicated history of actual life,
a brief enchantment, not to be disdained, but not to be con-
sidered the all in all. Look round the world, contemplate
all those who have married from passion—ten years after-
ward, whither has the passion flown 7 With a few, indeed,
where there is community of object and character, new
excitements, new aims, and hopes, spring up; and, having
first taken root in passion, the passion continues to shoot
out in their fresh stems and fibers. But deceive yourself
not; there is no such community between you and Main-
waring. What you call his goodness, you will learn here-
after to despise as feeble; and what in reality is your
mental power, he soon, too soon, will shudder at as un-
womanly and hateful.”
“Hold !” cried Lucretia, tremulously. “Hold ! and if
he does, I shall owe his hate to you—to your lessons—to
your deadly influence!”
“Lucretia, no l—the seeds were in you! Can cultiva-
tion force from the soil that which it is against the nature
of the soil to bear?”
“I will pluck out the weeds ! I will transform my-
self!”
“Child, I defy you!” said the scholar, with a smile that
gave to his face the expression his son had conveyed to it.
“I have warned you, and my task is done.” With that he
bowed and leaving her, was soon by the side of Sir Miles

St. John, and the baronet and his librarian a few moments
after entered the house and sat down to chess. -
But during the dialogues we have sketched, we must
not suppose that Sir Miles himself had been so wholly ab-
sorbed in the sensual gratification bestowed upon Europe
by the immortal Raleigh, as to neglect his guest and
kinsman.
“And so, Charley Vernon, it is not the fashion to smoke
in Lunnon” (thus Sir Miles pronounced the word, accord-
ing to the euphuism of his youth, and which, even at that
day, still lingered in courtly jargon).
“No, sir. However, to console us, we have most other
vices in full force.”
“I don't doubt it; they say the Prince's set exhaust
life pretty quickly.”
“It certainly requires the fortune of an earl and the
constitution of a prize-fighter, to live with him.”
“Yet methinks, Master Charley, you have neither one
nor the other.”
“And therefore I see before me, and at no very great
distance, the Bench—and a consumption l’ answered Wer-
non, suppressing a slight yawn. .
“'Tis a pity; for you had a fine estate properly man-
aged; and, in spite of your faults, you have the heart of a

with tenderness—“you are young enough yet to reform.

health and your acres.”

it is a wonder you did not add to your precepts the value
of your example.”
“Jackanapes! I had not your infirmities I never
was a spendthrift, and I have a constitution of iron 1"
There was a pause. “Charles,” continued Sir Miles,
musingly, “there is many an earl with a less fortune than
the conjoined estates of Vernon Grange and Laughton
Hall. You must already have understood me—it is my
intention to leave my estates to Lucretia—it is my wish,
nevertheless, to think you will not be the worse for my
will. Frankly, if you can like my niece, win her; settle
here while I live, put the Grange to nurse, and recruit
yourself by fresh air and field-sports. Zounds, Charles, I
love you, and that's the truthl–Give me your hand I"
“And a grateful heart with it, sir,” said Vernon, warmly,
evidently affected, as he started from his indolent position
and took the hand extended to him. “Believe me, I do
not covet your wealth, nor do I envy my cousin anything
so much as the first place in your regard.”
“Prettily said, my boy; and I don't suspect you of
insincerity. What think you, then, of my plan?”
Mr. Vernon seemed embarrassed; but, recovering him-
self with his usual ease, he replied archly, “Perhaps, sir,
it will be of little use to know what I think of your plan;
my fair cousin may have upset it already.”
“Ha, sir, let me look at you—so—so l—you are not
jesting. What the deuce do you mean? Gad, man,

what's his name—eh 7—do you not think that he is a very
handsome young fellow 7” said Mr. Vernon, drawing out
his snuff-box and offering it to his kinsman.
“Damn your snuff!” quoth Sir Miles, in great choler, as
he rejected the proffered courtesy with a vehemence that
sent half the contents of the box upon the joint eyes and
noses of the two canine favorites dozing at his feet. The
setter started up in an agony—the spaniel wheezed and
sniffled, and ran off, stopping every moment to take his
head between his paws. The old gentleman continued,
without heeding the sufferings of his dumb friends—a
symptom of rare discomposure on his part:
“Do you mean to insinuate, Mr. Vernon, that my niece
— my elder niece, Lucretia Clavering—condescends to
notice the looks, good or bad, of Mr. Mainwaring f
'Sdeath, sir, he is the son of a land-agent l Sir, he is in-
tended for trade l Sir, his highest ambition is to be part-
ner in some fifth-rate mercantile house !”
“My dear Sir Miles,” replied Mr. Vernon, as he con-
tinued to brush away, with his scented handkerchief, such
portions of the prince's mixture as his nankin inexpress-
ibles had diverted from the sensual organs of Dash and
Ponto—“my dear Sir Miles, 9a n'empéche pas le senti-

mésalliance; she has the mind and will of a queen—old
Queen Bess, I believe.”
“That is saying much for her talents, sir; but if so,
Heaven help her intended ! I am duly grateful for the
blessings you propose me!”
Despite his anger, the old gentleman could not help
smiling.
“Why, to confess the truth, she is hard to manage;
but we, men of the world, know how to govern women, I
hope—much more how to break in a girl scarce out of her
teens. As for this fancy of yours, it is sheer folly—Lu-
cretia knows my mind. She has seen her mother's fate;
she has seen her sister an exile from my house—why? for
no fault of hers, poor thing ! but because she is the child
of disgrace, and the mother's sin is visited on the daugh-
ter's head. I am a good-natured man, I fancy, as men
go; but I am old-fashioned enough to care for my race.
If Lucretia demeaned herself to love, to encourage, that
lad—why, I would strike her from my will, and put your
name where I have placed hers.”
“Sir,” said Vernon, gravely, and throwing aside all
affectation of manner, “this becomes serious; and I have
no right even to whisper a doubt by which it now seems
I might benefit. I think it imprudent, if you wish Miss
Clavering to regard me impartially as a suitor to her
hand, to throw her, at her age, in the way of a man far
superior to myself, and to most men, in personal advant-
ages—a man more of her own years, well educated, well
mannered, with no evidence of his inferior birth in his

appearance or his breeding. I have not the least ground
for supposing that he has made the slightest impression
on Miss Clavering, and if he has, it would be, perhaps,
but a girl's innocent and thoughtless fancy, easily shaken
off by time and worldly reflection: but pardon me, if I
say bluntly, that should that be so, you would be wholly
unjustified in punishing, even in blaming her—it is your-
self you must blame for your own carelessness, and that
forgetful blindness to human nature and youthful emotions,
which, I must say, is the less pardonable in one who has
known the world so intimately.”
“Charles Vernon,” said the old baronet, “give me your
hand, again l I was right, at least, when I said you had
the heart of a true gentleman. Drop this subject for the
present. Who has just left Lucretia yonder 7”
“Your protegé—the Frenchman.”
“Ah, he, at least, is not blind—go and join Lucretial”
Vernon bowed, emptied the remains of the Madeira
into a tumbler, drank the contents at a draught, and saun-
tered toward Lucretia; but she, perceiving his approach,
crossed abruptly into one of the alleys that led to the
other side of the house ; and he was either too indifferent,
or too well-bred, to force upon her the companionship
which she so evidently shunned. He threw himself at
length upon one of the benches in the lawn, and, leaning
his head upon his hand, fell into reflections which, had he
spoken, would have shaped themselves somewhat thus into
words:
“If I must take that girl as the price of this fair herit-

age, shall I gain or lose 2 I grant that she has the finest
neck and shoulders I ever saw out of marble; but far from
being in love with her, she gives me a feeling like fear and
aversion. Add to this, that she has evidently no kinder
sentiment for me than I for her; and if she once had a
heart, that young gentleman has long since coaxed it away.
Pleasant auspices, these, for matrimony, to a poor invalid,
who wishes at least to decline and to die in peace | More-
over, if I were rich enough to marry as I pleased—if I
were what, perhaps, I ought to be, heir to Laughton—
why, there is a certain sweet Mary in the world, whose
eyes are softer than Lucretia Clavering's: but that is a
dream l On the other hand, if I do not win this girl, and
my poor kinsman give her all or nearly all his possessions,
Vernon Grange goes to the usurers, and the King will
find a lodging for myself. What does it matter? I can-
not live above two or three years at the most, and can
only hope, therefore, that dear stout old Sir Miles may
outlive me. At thirty-three I have worn out fortune and
life; little pleasure could Laughton give me; brief pain
the Bench. Fore Gad, the philosophy of the thing is on
the whole against sour looks and the noose !” Thus de-
ciding in the progress of his reverie, he smiled, and changed
his position. The sun had set—the twilight was over—
the moon rose in splendor from amid a thick copse of
mingled beech and oak; the beams fell full on the face of
the muser, and the face seemed yet paler, and the exhaus-
tion of premature decay yet more evident by that still and
melancholy light—all ruins gain dignity by the moor.

This was a ruin nobler than that which painters place on
their canvas – the ruin, not of stone and brick, but of
humanity and spirit; the wreck of man, prematurely old,
not stricken by great sorrow, not bowed by great toil, but
fretted and mined away by small pleasures and poor ex-
citements—small and poor, but daily, hourly, momently at
their gnome-like work. Something of the gravity and the
true lesson of the hour and scene, perhaps, forced itself
upon a mind little given to sentiment, for Wernon rose
languidly, and muttered :
“My poor mother hoped better things from me. It is
well, after all, that it is broken off with Mary 1 Why
should there be any one to weep for me? I can the better
die smiling, as I have lived.”
Meanwhile, as it is necessary we should follow each of
the principal characters we have introduced through the
course of an evening more or less eventful in the destiny
of all, we return to Mainwaring, and accompany him to
the lake at the bottom of the park, which he reached as
its smooth surface glistened in the last beams of the sun.
He saw, as he neared the water, the fish sporting in the
pellucid tide; the dragon-fly darted and hovered in the
air; the tedded grass beneath his feet gave forth the
fragrance of crushed thyme and clover; the swan paused,
as if slumbering on the wave; the linnet and finch sang
still from the neighboring copses; and the heavy bees were
winging their way home with a drowsy murmur, -all
around were images of that unspeakable peace which Na-
ture whispers to those attuned to her music; all fitted to

lull, but not to deject the spirit—images dear to the holi-
day of the world-worn man, to the contemplation of serene
and retired age; to the boyhood of poets; to the youth
of lovers. But Mainwaring's step was heavy, and his
brow clouded; and Nature that evening was dumb to
him. At the margin of the lake stood a solitary angler,
who now (his evening's task done) was employed in leis-
urely disjointing his rod, and whistling with much sweet-
ness an air from one of Isaak Walton's songs. Mainwaring
reached the angler, and laid his hand on his shoulder:
“What sport, Ardworth 7”
“A few large roach with the fly, and one pike with a
gudgeon—a noble fellow l—look at him 1 He was lying
under the reeds yonder; I saw his green back, and teased

you and me and his French parasite, it is all stately de-
corum and punctilious courtesy:—‘Mr. Mainwaring, I am
delighted to see you;’ ‘Mr. Ardworth, as you are so near,
daro I ask you to ring the bell ?” “Mons. Dalibard, with
the utmost deference, I venture to disagree with you.”
IIowever, don't let my foolish susceptibility ruffle your
pride. And you, too, have a worthy object in view, which
might well detain you from roach and jack-fish. Have
you stolen your interview with the superb Lucretia?”
“Yes, stolen, as you say: and, like all thieves not thor-
oughly hardened, I am ashamed of my gains.”

there—that old root to lean your elbow on, this soft moss
for your cushion; sit down and confess. You have some-
thing on your mind that preys on you: we are old college

“There is no resisting you, Ardworth,” said Mainwar-
ing, smiling, and drawn from his reserve and his gloom by
the frank good humor of his companion: “I should like, I
own, to make a clean breast of it; and perhaps I may
profit by your advice. You know, in the first place, that
after I left college, my father, seeing me indisposed for the
church, to which he had always destined me in his own
heart, and for which, indeed, he had gone out of his way
to maintain me at the University, gave me the choice of
his own business as a surveyor and land-agent, or of enter-
ing into the mercantile profession. I chose the latter, and
went to Southampton, where we have a relation in busi-

I became acquainted with a good clergyman and his wife,
and in that house I passed a great part of my time.”
“With the hope, I trust, on better consideration, of
gratifying your father's ambition, and learning how to
starve with gentility on a cure.”
“Not much of that, I fear.”
“Then the clergyman had a daughter 7”
“You are nearer the mark now,” said Mainwaring,
coloring, “though it was not his daughter; a young lady
lived in his family, not even related to him; she was placed
there with a certain allowance by a rich relation. In a
word, I admired, perhaps I loved this young person; but
she was without an independence, and I not yet provided
even with the substitute of money, a profession. I fancied
(do not laugh at my vanity) that my feelings might be
returned. I was in alarm for her as well as myself; I
sounded the clergyman as to the chance of obtaining the
consent of her rich relation, and was informed that he
thought it hopeless. I felt I had no right to invite her
to poverty and ruin, and still less to entangle further (if I
had chanced to touch at all) her affection. I made an
excuse to my father to leave the town, and returned home.”
“Prudent and honorable enough, so far; unlike me, I
should have run off with the girl, if she loved me, and old
Plutus, the rascal, might have done his worst against
Cupid. But I interrupt you.”

on. My father had always taken keen interest in politics;
he was of the same party as Sir Miles, who, you know, is
red-hot upon politics. I was easily led—partly by ambi-
tion, partly by the effect of example, partly by the hope
to give a new turn to my thoughts—to make an appear-
ance in public.”
“And a devilish creditable one, too. Why, man, your
speeches have been quoted with rapture by the London
papers. Horridly aristocratic and Pittish, it is true;—I
think differently; but every man to his taste. Well xy
“My attempts, such as they were, procured me the
favor of Sir Miles. He had long been acquainted with
my father, who had helped him in his own elections years
ago. He seemed cordially delighted to patronize the son:
he invited me to visit him at Laughton, and hinted to my
father that I was formed for something better than a count-
ing-house: my poor father was intoxicated. In a word,
here I am—here, often for days, almost weeks together,
have I been, a guest, always welcomed.”
“You pause. This is the primordium—now comes the
confession, eh?”
“Why, one-half the confession is over. It was my most
unmerited fortune te attract the notice of Miss Clavering.
Do not fancy me so self-conceited as to imagine that I
should ever have presumed so high, but for—”
“But for encouragement—I understand l Well, she is
a magnificent creature in her way; and I do not wonder
that she drove the poor little girl at Southampton out of

“Ah l but there is the sore—I am not sure that she has
done so. Ardworth, I may trust you?”
“With everything but half a guinea. I would not
promise to be rock against so great a temptation;” and
Ardworth turned his empty pockets inside out.
“Tush—be serious !—or I go.”
“Serious ! With pockets like these, the devil's in it if I
am not serious. Perge precor.”
“Ardworth, then,” said Mainwaring, with great emo-
tion, “I confide to you the secret trouble of my heart.
This girl at Southampton is Lucretia's sister—her half-
sister: the rich relation on whose allowance she lives is
Sir Miles St. John.”
“Whew 1–1my own poor dear little cousin, by the
father's side 1 Mainwaring, I trust you have not deceived
me; you have not amused yourself with breaking Susan’s
heart—for a heart, and an honest, simple, English girl's
heart, she has.”
“Heaven forbid!—I tell you I have never even declared
my love—and if love it were, I trust it is over. But when
Sir Miles was first kind to me, first invited me, I own I
had the hope to win his esteem; and since he had always
made so strong and cruel a distinction between Lucretia
and Susan, I thought it not impossible that he might con-
sent at last to my union with the niece he had refused to
receive and acknowledge. But even while the hope was
in me, I was drawn on—I was entangled—I was spell-
bound—I know not how or why; but, to close my con-
fidence, while still doubtful whether my own heart is free

from the remembrance of the one sister, I am pledged to
the other.”
Ardworth looked down gravely and remained silent.
He was a joyous, careless, reckless youth, with unsteady
character and pursuits—and with something of vague
poetry, much of unaccommodating pride about his nature
—one of those youths little likely to do what is called well
in the world—not persevering enough for an independent
career—too blunt and honest for a servile one. But it was
in the very disposition of such a person to judge somewhat
harshly of Mainwaring's disclosure, and not easily to com-
prehend what, after all, was very natural—how a young
man, new to life, timid by character, and of an extreme
susceptibility to the fear of giving pain, had, in the sur-
prise, the gratitude, the emotion, of an avowed attachment
from a girl far above him in worldly position, been forced
by receiving, to seem, at least, to return her affection. And
indeed though not wholly insensible to the brilliant pros-
pects opened to him in such a connection, yet, to do him
justice, Mainwaring would have been equally entangled
by a similar avowal from a girl more his equal in the
world. It was rather from an amiability bordering upon
weakness, than from any more degrading moral imperfec-
tions, that he had been betrayed into a position which
neither contented his heart nor satisfied his conscience.
With far less ability than his friend, Ardworth had
more force and steadiness in his nature, and was wholly
free from that morbid delicacy of temperament to which
susceptible and shy persons owe much of their errors and

misfortunes. He said, therefore, after a long pause, “My
good fellow, to be plain with you, I cannot say that your
confession has improved you in my estimation; but that is
perhaps because of the bluntness of my understanding. I
could quite comprehend your forgetting Susan (and, after
all, I am left in doubt as to the extent of her conquest
over you) for the very different charms of her sister. On
the other hand, I could still better understand that, having
once fancied Susan, you could not be commanded into love
for Lucretia. But I do not comprehend your feeling love
for one, and making love to the other—which is the long
and short of the business.”
“That is not exactly the true statement,” answered
Mainwaring, with a powerful effort at composure. “There
are moments when, listening to Lucretia, when charmed by
that softness which, contrasting the rest of her character,
she exhibits to none but me, struck by her great mental
powers, proud of an unsought triumph over such a being,
I feel as if I could love none but her; then, suddenly, her
mood changes—she utters sentiments that chill and revolt
me—the very beauty seems vanished from her face. I re-
call, with a sigh, the simple sweetness of Susan, and I feel
as if I deceived both my mistress and myself Perhaps,
however, all the circumstances of this connection tend to
increase my doubts. It is humiliating to me to know that
I woo clandestinely and upon sufferance, that I am stealing,
as it were, into a fortune, that I am eating Sir Miles's
bread, and yet counting upon his death; and this shame
in myself may make me unconsciously unjust to Lucretia.

But it is useless to reprove me for what is past; and though
I at first imagined you could advise me for the future, I
now see, too clearly, that no advice could avail.”
“I grant that, too; for all you require, is to make up
your mind to be fairly off with the old love, or fairly on
with the new. However, now you have stated your case
thus frankly, if you permit me, I will take advantage of the
strange chance of finding myself here, and watch, ponder, and
counsel, if I can. This Lucratia, I own it, puzzles and
perplexes me; but, though no QEdipus, I will not take
fright at the Sphinx. I suppose now it is time to re-
turn. They expect some of the neighbors to drink tea,
and I must doff my fishing-jacket. Come!”
As they strolled toward the house, Ardworth broke a
silence which had lasted for some moments:
“And how is that dear good Fielden f I ought to have
guessed him at once, when you spoke of your clergyman
and his young charge : but I did not know he was at
Southampton.”
“He has exchanged his living for a year, on account of

bring poor Susan nearer to Laughton, in the chance of her
uncle seeing her. But you are, then, acquainted with

“Notwithstanding our intimacy, we have, like most
young men not related, spoken so little of our family mat-
ters, that I do not now understand how you are cousin to
Susan; nor what, to my surprise and delight, brought you
hither three days ago.”
“Faith, my story is easier to explain than your own,

But as Ardworth's recital partially involves references
to family matters not yet sufficiently known to the reader,
we must be pardoned if we assume to ourselves his task of
narrator, and necessarily enlarge on his details.
The branch of the illustrious family of St. John, repre-
sented by Sir Miles, diverged from the parent stem of the
Lords of Bletshoe. With them it placed at the summit of
its pedigree the name of William de St. John, the Con-
queror's favorite and trusted warrior, and Oliva de Filgiers.
With them it blazoned the latter alliance, which gave to
Sir Oliver St. John the lands of Bletshoe by the hand of
Margaret Beauchamp (by her second marriage with the
Duke of Somerset, grandmother to Henry VII.). In the
following generation, the younger son of a younger son
had founded, partly by offices of state, partly by mar-
riage with a wealthy heiress, a house of his own; and
in the reign of James I., the St. Johns of Laughton
ranked among the chief gentlemen of Hampshire. From
that time till the accession of George III., the family,
though it remained untitled, had added to its consequence
by intermarriages of considerable dignity, chosen, indeed,
with a disregard for money uncommon among the English

aristocracy, so that the estate was but little enlarged since
the reign of James, though profiting, of course, by im-
proved cultivation and the different value of money. On
the other band, perhaps there were scarcely ten families in
the country who could boast of a similar directness of de-
scent on all sides, from the proudest and noblest aristocracy
of the soil: and Sir Miles St. John, by blood, was, almost
at the distance of eight centuries, as pure a Norman as his
ancestral William. His grandfather, nevertheless, had devi-
ated from the usual disinterested practice of the family,
and had married an heiress, who brought the quarterings
of Vernon to the crowded escutcheon, and with these
quarterings an estate of some £4000 a year, popularly
known by the name of Vernon Grange. This rare occur-
rence did not add to the domestic happiness of the con-
tracting parties, nor did it lead to the ultimate increase of
the Laughton possessions. Two sons were born. To the
elder was destined the father's inheritance—to the younger
the maternal property. One house is not large enough
for two heirs. Nothing could exceed the pride of the
father as a St. John, except the pride of the mother as a
Vernon. Jealousies between the two sons began early,
and rankled deep; nor was there peace at Laughton till
the younger had carried away from its rental the lands of
Vernon Grange; and the elder remained just where his
predecessors stood in point of possessions—sole lord of
Laughton sole. The elder son, Sir Miles's father, had
been, indeed, so chafed by the rivalry with his brother,
that in disgust he had run away, and thrown himself, at

the age of fourteen, into the navy. By accident or by
merit he rose high in that profession, acquired name and
fame, and lost an eye and an arm, for which he was
gazetted, at the same time, an admiral and a baronet.
Thus mutilated and dignified, Sir George St. John re-
tired from the profession; and finding himself unmarried,
and haunted by the apprehension that if he died childless
Laughton would pass to his brother's heirs, he resolved
upon consigning his remains to the nuptial couch, previous
to the surer peace of the family vault. At the age of
fifty-nine, the grim veteran succeeded in finding a young
lady of unblemished descent, and much marked with the
small-pox, who consented to accept the only hand which
Sir George had to offer. From this marriage sprang a
numerous family; but all died in early childhood, fright-
ened to death, said the neighbors, by their tender parents
(considered the ugliest couple in the county), except one
boy (the present Sir Miles) and one daughter, many years
younger, destined to become Lucretia's mother. Sir Miles
came early into his property; and although the softening
advance of civilization, with the liberal effects of travel,
and a long residence in cities, took from him that pro-
vincial austerity of pride, which is only seen in stanch per-
ſection among the lords of a village, he was yet little less
susceptible to the duties of maintaining his lineage pure as
its representation had descended to him, than the most
superb of his predecessors. But owing, it was said, to an
early disappointment, he led, during youth and manhood,
a roving and desultory life, and so put off from year to

year the grand experiment matrimonial, until he arrived
at old age, with the philosophical determination to select
from the other branches of his house the successor to the
heritage of St. John. In thus arrogating to himself a right
to neglect his proper duties as head of a family, he found
his excuse in adopting his niece Lucretia. His sister had
chosen for her first husband a friend and neighbor of his
own, a younger son, of unexceptionable birth, and of very
agreeable manners in society. But this gentleman con-
trived to render her life so miserable, that, though he died
fifteen months after their marriage, his widow could scarcely
be expected to mourn long for him. A year after Mr.
Clavering's death, Mrs. Clavering married again, under
the mistaken notion that she had the right to choose for
herself. She married Dr. Mivers, the provincial physician
who had attended her husband in his last illness—a gentle-
man by education, manners, and profession, but unhappily
the son of a silk-mercer. Sir Miles never forgave this
connection. By her first marriage, Sir Miles's sister had
one daughter, Lucretia; by her second marriage, another
daughter, named Susan. She survived somewhat more
than a year the birth of the latter: on her death, Sir Miles
formally (through his agent) applied to Dr. Mivers for his
tldest niece, Lucretia Clavering, and the physician did not
think himself justified in withholding from her the proba-
ble advantages of a transfer from his own roof to that of
her uncle. He himself had been no worldly gainer by his
connection; his practice had suffered materially, from the
sympathy which was felt by the county families for the

supposed wrongs of Sir Miles St. John, who was per-
sonally not only popular, but esteemed, nor less so on ac-
count of his pride: too dignified to refer even to his
domestic annoyances, except to his most familiar associates
—to them, indeed, Sir Miles had said briefly, that he con-
sidered a physician who abused his entrance into a noble
family by stealing into its alliance, was a character in
whose punishment all society had an interest. The words
were repeated ; they were thought just. Those who ven-
tured to suggest that Mrs. Clavering, as a widow, was a
free agent, were regarded with suspicion. It was the time
when French principles were just beginning to be held in
horror, especially in the provinces, and when everything
that encroached upon the rights and prejudices of the
high-born was called “a French principle.” Dr. Mivers
was as much scouted as if he had been a sans-culotte.
Obliged to quit the county, he settled at a distance; but
he had a career to commence again; his wife's death en-
feebled his spirits and damped his exertions. He did
little more than earn a bare subsistence, and died at last,
when his only daughter was fourteen, poor and embar-
rassed. On his death-bed he wrote a letter to Sir Miles,
reminding him that, after all, Susan was his sister's child,
gently vindicating himself from the unmerited charge of
treachery, which had blasted his fortunes and left his
orphan penniless; and closing with a touching, yet a manly
appeal to the sole relative left to befriend her. The clergy.
man who had attended him in his dying moments took
charge of this letter; he brought it in person to Laughton,

and delivered it to Sir Miles. Whatever his errors, the
old baronet was no common man. He was not vindictive,
though he could not be called forgiving. He had con-
sidered his conduct to his sister a duty owed to his name
and ancestors; she had placed herself and her youngest
child out of the pale of his family. He would not receive
as his niece the granddaughter of a silk-mercer. The rela-
tionship was extinct, as, in certain countries, nobility is
forfeited by a union with an inferior class. But, niece or
not, here was a claim to humanity and benevolence; and
never yet had appeal been made by suffering to his heart
and purse in vain.
He bowed his head over the letter as his eye came to
the last line, and remained silent so long, that the clergy-
man, at last, moved and hopeful, approached and took his
hand. It was the impulse of a good man and a good
priest. Sir Miles looked up in surprise; but the calm
pitying face bent on him repelled all return of pride.
“Sir,” he said, tremulously, and he pressed the hand
that grasped his own, “I thank you. I am not fit at this
moment to decide what to do: to-morrow, you shall know
And the man died poor? not in want, not in want?”
“Comfort yourself, worthy sir; he had, at the last, all

(so the good priest was named) felt confident of the suc-
cess of his mission; but, to win it the more support, he
sought Lucretia. She was then seventeen : it is an age
when the heart is peculiarly open to the household ties—
to the memory of a mother—to the sweet name of sister.
'He sought this girl, he told his tale, and pleaded the sis-
ter's cause. Lucretia heard in silence; neither eye nor lip
betrayed emotion; but her color went and came. This
was the only sign that she was moved : moved, but how f
Fielden's experience in the human heart could not guess.
When he had done, she went quietly to her desk (it was
in her own room that the conference took place)—she un-
locked it with a deliberate hand—she took from it a pock-
et-book and a case of jewels, which Sir Miles had given
her on her last birthday “Let my sister have these—
while I live she shall not want l”
“My dear young lady, it is not these things that she
asks from you; it is your affection, your sisterly heart,
your intercession with her natural protector; these, in her
name, I ask for—non gemmis neque purpurá venale, mec
auro !”
Lucretia then, still without apparent emotion, raised to
the good man's face, deep, penetrating, but unrevealing
eyes, and said slowly:
“Is my sister like my mother, who, they say, was hand-
some 7”
Much startled by this question, Fielden answered: “I
never saw your mother, my dear; but your sister gives
promise of more than common comeliness.”


## p. 63 (#69) ##############################################

LU CRETIA. 63
Lucretia's brows grew slightly compressed. “And her
education has been, of course, neglected 7”
“Certainly, in some points—mathematics, for instance,
and theology. But she knows what ladies generally know
—French and Italian, and such like. Dr. Mivers was not
unlearned in the polite letters. Oh, trust me, my dear
young lady, she will not disgrace your family; she will
justify your uncle's favor. Plead for her!"—and the good
man clasped his hands.
Lucretia's eyes fell musingly on the ground; but she
resumed, after a short pause.
“What does my uncle himself say?”
“Only that he will decide to-morrow.”
“I will see him;” and Lucretia left the room as for
that object. But when she had gained the stairs, she
paused at the large embayed casement, which formed a
niche in the landing-place, and gazed over the broad
domains beyond; a stern smile settled, then, upon her
lips; the smile seemed to say—“In this inheritance I
will have no rival.”
Lucretia's influence with Sir Miles was great; but here
it was not needed. Before she saw him he had decided
on his course. Her precocious, and apparently intuitive
knowledge of character, detected, at a glance, the safety
with which she might intercede. She did so, and was
chid into silence.
The next morning, Sir Miles took the priest's arm, and
walked with him into the gardens.
“Mr. Fielden,” he said, with the air of a man who has

chosen his course, and deprecites all attempt to make him
swerve from it, “if I followed my own selfish wishes, I
should take home this poor child. Stay, sir, and hear me
—I am no hypocrite, and I speak honestly—I like young
faces—I have no family of my own;–I love Lucretia, and
I am proud of her; but a girl brought up in adversity
might be a better nurse, and a more docile companion—
let that pass. I have reflected, and I feel that I cannot
set to Lucretia—set to children unborn—the example of
indifference to a name degraded and a race adulterated:
you may call this pride, or prejudice—I view it differently.
There are duties due from an individual, duties due from a
nation, duties due from a family; as my ancestors thought,
so think I. They left me the charge of their name, as the
fief-rent by which I hold their lands. 'Sdeath, sir! pardon
me the expletive l—I was about to say, that if I am now

of my attachment was not my equal—that was a bitter
struggle ! I triumphed, and I rejoice at it, though the
result was to leave all thoughts of wedlock elsewhere

who will not still further degrade her lineage on her
mother's side,-in a word, if she select a gentleman. Mr.
Fielden, on this subject I have no more to say.”
In vain the good clergyman, whose very conscience, as
well as reason, was shocked by the deliberate and argu-
mentative manner with which the baronet had treated the
abandonment of his sister's child as an absolutely moral,
almost religious duty, in vain he exerted himself to repel
such sophisms, and put the matter in its true light. It was
easy for him to move Sir Miles's heart—that was ever
gentle—that was moved already; but the crotchet in his
head was impregnable. The more touchingly he painted
poor Susan's unfriended youth, her sweet character, and
promising virtues, the more Sir Miles St. John considered
himself a martyr to his principles, and the more obstinate
in the martyrdom he became. “Poor thing ! poor child !”
he said often, and brushed a tear from his eyes; “a thou-
sand pities Well, well, I hope she will be happy l Mind,
money shall never stand in the way if she have a suitable
offer l’” This was all the worthy clergyman, after an
hour's eloquence, could extract from him. Out of breath,
and out of patience, he gave in at last; and the baronet,
still holding his reluctant arm, led him back toward the
house. After a prolonged pause, Sir Miles said abruptly:
“I have been thinking that I may have unwittingly injured
this man—this Mivers—while I deemed only that he in-
jured me. As to reparation to his daughter, that is set-
tled; and, after all, though I do not publicly acknowledge
her, she is half my own niece.”

“Half?”
“Half—the father's side don't count, of course, and,
rigidly speaking, the relationship is, perhaps, forfeited on
the other. However, that half of it I grant. Zooks, sir,
I say I grant it!—I beg you ten thousand pardons for
my vehemence. To return, perhaps I can show at least
that I bear no malice to this poor doctor. He has rela-
tions of his own—silk-mercers—trade has reverses. How
are they off?”
Perfectly perplexed by this very contradictory and pa-
radoxical, yet, to one better acquainted with Sir Miles,
very characteristic benevolence, Fielden was some time
before he answered. “Those members of Dr. Mivers's
family who are in trade are sufficiently prosperous; they
have paid his debts; they, Sir Miles, will receive his
daughter.”
“By no means !” cried Sir Miles, quickly; then re-
covering himself, he added, “or, if you think that advis-
able, of course all interference on my part is withdrawn.”
“Festina lente /-not so quick, Sir Miles. I do not ye
say that it is advisable—not because they are silk-mercers,

of this. Well, then, the doctor has left no relations that

“No; and by his father's side (since you so esteem
such vanities) of an ancient family—a sister of Dr. Mivers

“Ardworth–a goodish name—Ardworth of York-
shire?”
“Yes, of that family. It was, of course, an imprudent
marriage, contracted while he was only an ensign. His
family did not reject him, Sir Miles.”
“Sir, Ardworth is a good squire's family, but the name
is Saxon; there is no difference in race between the head
of the Ardworths, if he were a duke, and my gardener,
John Hodge–Saxon and Saxon, both. His family did
not reject him—go on.”
“But he was a younger son in a large family—both him-
self and his wife have known all the distresses common,
they tell me, to the poverty of a soldier who has no re-
source but his pay. They have a son; Dr. Mivers—though
so poor himself—took this boy, for he loved his sister
dearly, and meant to bring him up to his own profession.

and deserving.”
“Let his education be completed—send him to the uni-

which his father's family would approve. You need not
mention to any one my intentions in this respect, not even
to the lad. And now, Mr. Fielden, I have done my duty

the more I shall be pleased and grateful; but this topic,

“The army l—oh, fie, Sir Miles, I must speak one word

Sir Miles mused a moment, and struck his crutch-stick
thrice firmly on the ground.
“I see no great objection to that; but, by the address
of this letter, the poor girl is too far from Laughton to
send Lucretia to her.”
“I can obviate that objection, Sir Miles. It is my wish
to continue to Susan her present home among my own
children—my wife loves her dearly ; and had you con-
sented to give her the shelter of your own roof, I am sure
I should not have seen a smile in the house for a month
after. If you permit this plan, as indeed you honored
me by suggesting it, I can pass through Southampton,
on my way to my own living in Devonshire, and Miss
Clavering can visit her sister there "

“Let it be so,” said Sir Miles, briefly; and so the con-
versation closed.
Some weeks afterward, Lucretia went in her uncle's
carriage, with four post-horses, with her maid and her
footman—went in the state and pomp of heiress to Laugh-
ton—to the small lodging-house in which the kind pastor
crowded his children and his young guest. She stayed
there some days. She did not weep when she embraced
Susan—she did not weep when she took leave of her;
but she showed no want of actual kindness, though the
kindness was formal and stately. On her return, Sir
Miles forebore to question; but he looked as if he ex-
pected, and would willingly permit, her to speak on what
might naturally be uppermost at her heart. Lucretia,
however, remained silent, till at last the baronet, coloring
as if ashamed of his curiosity, said:
“Is your sister like your mother ?”
“You forget, sir, I can have no recollection of my
mother.”
“Your mother had a strong family likeness to myself.”
“She is not like you—they say she is like Dr. Mivers.”
“Oh 1” said the baronet, and he asked no more. The
sisters did not meet again: a few letters passed between
them, but the correspondence gradually ceased.
Young Ardworth went to college, prepared by Mr.
Fielden, who was no ordinary scholar, and an accurate
and profound mathematician—a more important requisite
than classical learning in a tutor for Cambridge. But
Ardworth was idle, and perhaps even dissipated. He

took a common degree, and made some debts, which were
paid by Sir Miles without a murmur. A few letters then
passed between the baronet and the clergyman as to Ard-
worth's future destiny; the latter owned that his pupil
was not persevering enough for the bar, nor steady enough
for the church. These were no great faults in Sir Miles's
eyes. He resolved, after an effort, to judge himself of the
capacities of the young man, and so came the invitation
to Laughton. Ardworth was greatly surprised when
Fielden communicated to him this invitation, for hitherto
he had not conceived the slightest suspicion of his bene-
factor—he had rather, and naturally, supposed that some
relation of his father's had paid for his maintenance at the
university; and he knew enough of the family history to
look upon Sir Miles as the proudest of men. How was
it, then, that he who would not receive the daughter of
Dr. Mivers, his own niece, would invite the nephew of Dr.
Mivers, who was no relation to him 7 However, his cu-
riosity was excited, and Fielden was urgent that he should
go;—to Laughton, therefore, had he gone.
We have now brought down, to the opening of our nar-
rative, the general records of the family it concerns; we
have reserved our account of the rearing and the character
of the personage most important, perhaps, in the develop-
ment of its events—Lucretia Clavering; in order to place
singly before the reader, the portrait of her dark, mis
guided, and ill-boding youth.

WHEN Lucretia first came to the house of Sir Miles St.
John, she was an infant about four years old. The baronet
then lived principally in London, with occasional visits
rather to the Continent or a watering-place, than to his
own family mansion. He did not pay any minute atten-
tion to his little ward—satisfied that her nurse was sedu-
lous, and her nursery airy and commodious. When at the
age of seven, she began to interest him, and he himself,
approaching old age, began seriously to consider whether
he should select her as his heiress, for hitherto he had not
formed any decided or definite notions on the matter—he
was startled by a temper so vehement, so self willed and
sternly imperious, so obstinately bent upon attaining its
object, so indifferently contemptuous of warning, reproof,
coaxing, or punishment, that her governess honestly came
to him in despair.
The management of this unmanageable child interested
Sir Miles. It caused him to think of Lucretia seriously;
it caused him to have her much in his society, and always
in his thoughts; the result was, that by amusing and oc-
cupying him, she forced a stronger hold on his affections
than she might have done had she been more like the

ordinary run of commonplace children. Of all dogs, there
is no dog that so attaches a master as a dog that snarls at
everybody else,_that no other hand can venture to pat
with impunity; of all horses, there is none which so flatters
the rider, from Alexander downward, as a horse that no-
body else can ride. Extend this principle to the human
species, and you may understand why Lucretia became so
dear to Sir Miles St. John—she got at his heart through
his vanity. For though, at times, her brow darkened, and
her eye flashed even at his remonstrance, she was yet no
sooner in his society than she made a marked distinction
between him and the subordinates, who had hitherto sought
to control her. Was this affection ?—he thought so Alas,
what parent can trace the workings of a child's mind—
springs moved by an idle word from a nurse—a whispered
conference between hirelings I Was it possible that Lu-
cretia had not often been menaced, as the direst evil that
could befall her, with her uncle's displeasure; that long
before she could be sensible of mere worldly loss or profit,
she was not impressed with a vague sense of Sir Miles's
power over her fate; nay, when trampling, in childish
wrath and scorn, upon some menial's irritable feelings, was
it possible that she had not been told that, but for Sir
Miles, she would be little better than a servant herself?
Be this as it may, all weakness is prone to dissimulate:
and rare and happy is the child whose feelings are as pure
and transparent as the fond parent deems them. There is
something in children, too, which seems like an instinctive
deference to the aristocratic appearances which sway the

world. Sir Miles's stately person—his imposing dress, the
respect with which he was surrounded—all tended to beget
notions of superiority and power, to which it was no shame
to succumb, as it was to Miss Black, the governess, whom
the maids answered pertly, or Martha, the nurse, whom
Miss Black snubbed if Lucretia tore her frock.
Sir Miles's affection once won—his penetration not per-
haps blinded to her more evident faults, but his self-love
soothed toward regarding them leniently—there was much
in Lucretia's external gifts which justified the predilection
of the haughty man. As a child, she was beautiful, and,
perhaps, from her very imperfections of temper, her beauty
had that air of distinction which the love of command is
apt to confer. If Sir Miles was with his friends when Lu-
cretia swept into the room, he was pleased to hear them
call her their little “princess,” and pleased yet more at a
certain dignified tranquillity with which she received their
caresses or their toys, and which he regarded as the sign
of a superior mind: nor was it long, indeed, before what
we call a superior mind developed itself in the young Lu-
cretia. All children are quick till they are set methodically
to study; but Lucretia's quickness defied even that numb-
ing ordeal, by which half of us are rendered dunces. Ra.
pidity and precision in all the tasks set to her, in the
comprehension of all the explanations given to her ques-
tions, evinced singular powers of readiness and reasoning.
As she grew older, she became more reserved and
thoughtful. Seeing but few children of her own age, and

mixing intimately with none, her mind was debarred from
the usual objects which distract the vivacity, the restless
and wondrous observation, of childhood. She came in
and out of Sir Miles's library of a morning, or his drawing-
room of an evening till her hour for rest, with unquestioned
and sometimes unnoticed freedom; she listened to the con-
versation around her, and formed her own conclusions un-
checked. It has a great influence upon a child, whether
for good or for evil, to mix early and habitually with those
grown up—for good to the mere intellect always—the evil
depends upon the character and discretion of those the
child sees and hears—“Reverence the greatest is due to
children,” exclaims the wisest of the Romans;* that is to
say, that we must revere the candor and inexperience and
innocence of their minds.
Now Sir Miles's habitual associates were persons of the
world; well-bred and decorous, indeed, before children, as
the best of the old school were—avoiding all anecdotes,
all allusions, for which the prudent matron would send her
girls out of the room; but, with that reserve, speaking of
the world as the world goes; if talking of young A–, cal-
culating carelessly what he would have when old A–, his
father, died—naturally giving to wealth, and station, and
ability, their fixed importance in life—not over-apt to
single out for eulogium some quiet goodness, rather in-
clined to speak with irony of pretensions to virtue—rarely
speaking but with respect of the worldly seemings which

rule mankind;—all these had their inevitable effect upon
that keen, quick, yet moody and reflective intellect.
Sir Miles removed at last to Laughton. He gave up
London—why, he acknowledged not to himself; but it
was because he had outlived his age—most of his old set
were gone—new hours, new habits had stolen in. He had
ceased to be of importance as a marrying man, as a per-
sonage of fashion; his health was impaired; he shrank
from the fatigues of a contested election; he resigned his
seat in Parliament for his native county, and, once settled
at Laughton, the life there soothed and flattered him—
there, all his former claims to distinction were still fresh.
He amused himself by collecting, in his old halls and
chambers, his statues and pictures, and felt that, without
fatigue or trouble, he was a greater man at Laughton
in his old age, than he had been in London during his
youth. -
Lucretia was then thirteen. Three years afterward,
Olivier Dalibard was established in the house, and from
that time a great change became noticeable in her. The
irregular vehemence of her temper gradually subsided, and
was replaced by an habitual self-command, which rendered
the rare deviations from it more effective and imposing.
Her pride changed its character wholly and permanently;
no word, no look of scorn to the low-born and the poor
escaped her. The masculine studies which her erudite
tutor opened to a grasping and inquisitive mind, elevaicd
her very errors above the petty distinctions of class. She
imbibed earnestly what Dalibard assumed or felt,-the

more dangerous pride of the fallen angel,—and set up the
intellect as a deity. All belonging to the mere study of
mind charmed and enchained her; but active and practical
in her very reveries, if she brooded, it was to scheme, to
plot, to weave web and mesh, and to smile in haughty tri-
umph at her own ingenuity and daring. The first lesson
of mere worldly wisdom teaches us to command temper;
it was worldly wisdom that made the once impetuous girl
calm, tranquil, and serene. Sir Miles was pleased by a
change that removed from Lucretia's outward character
its chief blot; perhaps, as his frame declined, he sighed
sometimes to think that with so much majesty there ap-
peared but little tenderness; he took, however, the merits
with the faults, and was content upon the whole.
If the Provençal had taken more than common pains
with his young pupil, the pains were not solely disinterested.
In plunging her mind amid that profound corruption which
belongs only to intellect cultivated in scorn of good, and
in suppression of heart, he had his own views to serve.
He watched the age when the passions ripen; and he
grasped at the fruit which his training sought to mature.
In the human heart ill regulated there is a dark desire for
the forbidden. This Lucretia felt—this her studies cher-
ished, and her thoughts brooded over. She detected, with
the quickness of her sex, the preceptor's stealthy aim. She
started not at the danger. Proud of her mastery over her-
self, she rather triumphed in luring on into weakness this
master-intelligence which had lighted up her own, to see
her slave in her teacher—to despise or to pity him whom

she had first contemplated with awe. And with this mere
pride of the understanding might be connected that of the
sex; she had attained the years when woman is curious to
know and to sound her power. To inflame Dalibard's
cupidity or ambition was easy; but to touch his heart—
that marble heart!—this had its dignity and its charm.
Strange to say, she succeeded. The passion, as well as
interest, of this dangerous and able man became enlisted
in his hopes; and now the game played between them had
a terror in its suspense; for if Dalibard penetrated not
into the recesses of his pupil's complicated nature, she was
far from having yet sounded the hell that lay black and
devouring beneath his own. Not through her affections—
those he scarce hoped for—but through her inexperience,
her vanity, her passions, he contemplated the path to his
victory over her soul and her fate. And so resolute, so
wily, so unscrupulous was this person who had played
upon all the subtlest keys and chords in the scale of turbu-
lent life, that, despite the lofty smile with which Lucretia
at length heard and repelled his suit, he had no fear of the
ultimate issue, when all his projects were traversed, all
his mines and stratagems abruptly brought to a close, by
an event which he had wholly unforeseen—the appearance
of a rival; the ardent and almost purifying love, which,
escaping awhile from all the demons he had evoked, she had,
with a girl's frank heart and impulse, conceived for Main-
waring. And here, indeed, was the great crisis in Lu-
cretia's life and destiny. So interwoven with her nature
had become the hard calculations of the understanding;
7+

so habitual to her now was the zest for scheming, which
revels in the play and vivacity of intrigue and plot, and
which Shakspeare has, perhaps, intended chiefly to depict
in the villainy of Iago, that it is probable Lucretia could
never become a character thoroughly amiable and honest.
But with a happy and well-placed love, her ambition might
have had legitimate vents; her restless energies, the wo.
man's natural field in sympathies for another. The heart
once opened softens by use: gradually and unconsciously
the interchange of affection, the companionship with an
upright and ingenuous mind (for virtue is not only beauti-
ful—it is contagious) might have had their redeeming and
hallowing influence. Happier, indeed, had it been, if her
choice had fallen upon a more commanding and lofty na-
ture. But perhaps it was the very meekness and suscepti-
bility of Mainwaring's temper, relieved from feebleness by
his talents, which, once in play, were undeniably great,
that pleased her by contrast with her own hardness of
spirit and despotism of will.
That Sir Miles should have been blind to the position of
the lovers, is less disparaging to his penetration than it
may appear; for the very imprudence with which Lucretia
abandoned herself to the society of Mainwaring during his
visits at Laughton, took a resemblance to candor. Sir
Miles knew his niece to be more than commonly clever
and well informed; that she, like him, should feel that the
conversation of a superior young man was a relief to the
ordinary babble of their country neighbors, was natural
enough; and if now and then a doubt, a fear, had crossed

his mind, and rendered him more touched than he liked to
own by Vernon's remarks, it had vanished upon perceiving
that Lucretia never seemed a shade more pensive in Main-
waring's absence. The listlessness and the melancholy
which are apt to accompany love, especially where unpro-
pitiously placed, were not visible on the surface of this
strong nature. In truth, once assured that Mainwaring
returned her affection, Lucretia reposed on the future with
a calm and resolute confidence; and her customary dis-
simulation closed like an unruffled sea over all the under-
currents that met and played below. Still Sir Miles's
attention once, however slightly, aroused to the recollec-
tion that Lucretia was at the age when woman naturally
meditates upon love and marriage, had suggested, afresh
and more vividly, a project which had before been indis-
tinctly conceived, viz., the union of the divided branches of
his house by the marriage of the last male of the Vernons
with the heiress of the St. Johns. Sir Miles had seen
much of Vernon himself, at various intervals: he had been
present at his christening, though he had refused to be his
godfather, for fear of raising undue expectations; he had
visited and munificently “tipped ” him at Eton; he had
accompanied him to his quarters when he joined the
Prince's regiment; he had come often in contact with
him, when, at the death of his father, Vernon retired front
the army and blazed in the front ranks of metropolitan
fashion; he had given him counsel, and had even lent him
money. Vernon's spendthrift habits, and dissipated if not
dissolute life, had certainly confirmed the old baronet in

his intentions to trust the lands of Laughton to the lesser
risk which property incurs in the hands of a female, if
tightly settled on her, than in the more colossal and multi-
form luxuries of an expensive man; and to do him justice,
during the flush of Vernon's riotous career, he had shrunk
from the thought of confiding the happiness of his niece to
so unstable a partner. But of late, whether from his im-
paired health, or his broken fortunes, Vernon's follies had
been less glaring. He had now arrived at the mature age
of thirty-three, when wild oats may reasonably be sown.
The composed and steadfast character of Lucretia might
serve to guide and direct him: and Sir Miles was one of those
who hold the doctrine that a reformed rake makes the best
husband; add to this, there was nothing in Vernon's repu-
tation (once allowing that his thirst for pleasure was slaked)
which could excite serious apprehensions. Through all his
difficulties, he had maintained his honor unblemished; a
thousand traits of amiability and kindness of heart made
him popular and beloved. He was nobody's enemy but
his own. His very distresses—the prospect of his ruin, if
left unassisted by Sir Miles's testamentary dispositions—
were arguments in his favor. And, after all, though Lu-
cretia was a nearer relation, Vernon was in truth the direct
male heir, and, according to the usual prejudices of family,
therefore, the fitter representative of the ancient line. With
these feelings and views, he had invited Vernon to his
house, and we have seen already that his favorable im-
pressions had been confirmed by the visit.
And here, we must say, that Vernon himself had been

brought up in boyhood and youth to regard himself the
presumptive inheritor of Laughton. It had been, from
time immemorial, the custom of the St. Johns to pass by
the claims of females in the settlement of the entails: from
male to male the estate had gone—furnishing warriors to
the army and senators to the state. And if when Lu-
cretia first came to Sir Miles's house the bright prospect
seemed somewhat obscured, still the mésalliance of the
mother, and Sir Miles's obstinate resentment thereat,
seemed to warrant the supposition that he would prob-
ably only leave to the orphan the usual portion of a
daughter of the.house, and that the lands would go in
their ordinary destination. This belief, adopted passively,
and as a thing of course, had had a very prejudicial effect
upon Vernon's career. What mattered that he overen-
joyed his youth, that the subordinate property of the Wer-
nons, a paltry four or five thousand pounds a year, went
a little too fast—the splendid estates of Laughton would
recover all. From this dream he had only been awakened
two or three years before, by an attachment he had formed
to the portionless daughter of an earl; and the Grange
being too far encumbered to allow him the proper settle-
ments which the lady's family required, it became a matter
of importance to ascertain Sir Miles's intentions. Too
delicate himself to sound them, he had prevailed upon the
earl, who was well acquainted with Sir Miles, to take
Laughton in his way to his own seat in Dorsetshire, and,
without betraying the grounds of his interest in the ques-
tion, learn carelessly, as it were, the views of the wealthy

man. The result had been a severe and terrible disap-
pointment. Sir Miles had then fully determined upon
constituting Lucretia his heiress, and, with the usual open-
ness of his character, he had plainly said so, upon the very
first covert and polished allusion to the subject, which the
earl slily made. This discovery, in breaking off all hopes
of an union with Lady Mary Stanville, had crushed more
than mercenary expectations. It affected, through his
heart, Vernon's health and spirits; it rankled deep, and
was resented at first as a fatal injury. But Vernon's
native nobility of disposition gradually softened an indig-
nation which his reason convinced him was groundless and
unjust. Sir Miles had never encouraged the expectations,
which Vernon's family and himself had unthinkingly formed.
The baronet was master of his own fortune, and, after all,
was it not more natural that he should prefer the child he
had brought up and reared, to a distant relation, little more
than an acquaintance, simply because man succeeded to
man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns? And, Mary
fairly lost to him, his constitutional indifference to money,
a certain French levity of temper, a persuasion that his
life was nearing its wasted close, had left him without re-
gret, as without resentment, at his kinsman's decision.
IIis boyish affection for the hearty, generous old gentle-
man returned, and though he abhorred the country, he had,
without a single interested thought or calculation, cor-
dially accepted the baronet's hospitable overtures, and
deserted, for the wilds of Hampshire, “the sweet shady
side of Pall Mall.”

We may now enter the drawing-room at Laughton, in
which were already assembled several of the families re-
siding in the more immediate neighborhood, and who
sociably dropped in to chat around the national tea-table,
play a rubber at whist, or make up, by the help of two or
three children and two or three grandpapas, a merry coun-
try dance. For, in that happy day, people were much
more sociable than they are now, in the houses of our
rural Thanes. Our country seats became bustling and
animated after the Birthday; many even of the more im-
portant families resided, indeed, all the year round on
their estates. The Continent was closed to us; the fas-
tidious exclusiveness which comes from habitual residence
in cities, had not made that demarkation in castes and in
talk, between neighbor and neighbor, which exists now.
Our squires were less educated, less refined, but more hos-
pitable and unassuming. In a word, there was what does
not exist now, except in some districts remote from Lon
don,--a rural society for those who sought it.
The party, as we enter, is grouped somewhat thus—but
first, we must cast a glance at the room itself, which rarely
failed to be the first object to attract a stranger's notice.
It was a long, and not particularly well-proportioned apart-
ment, according, at least, to modern notions, for it had
rather the appearance of two rooms thrown into one. At
the distance of about thirty-five, feet, the walls, before
somewhat narrow, were met by an arch, supported by
carved pilasters, which opened into a space nearly double
tne width of the previous part of the room, with a domed

ceiling, and an embayed window of such depth that the
recess almost formed a chamber in itself. But both these
divisions of the apartment corresponded exactly in point
of decoration; they had the same small paneling, painted
a very light green, which seemed almost white by candle-
light, each compartment wrought with an arabesque, the
same enriched fieke and cornice; they had the same high
mantle-pieces, ascending to the ceiling, with the arms of
St. John in bold relief. They had, too, the same old-
fashioned and venerable furniture, draperies of thick figured
velvet, with immense chairs and sofas to correspond, inter-
spersed, it is true, with more modern and commodious
inventions of the upholsterer's art, in grave stuffed leather,
or lively chintz. Two windows, nearly as deep as that in
the farther division, broke the outline of the former one,
and helped to give that irregular and nooky appearance
to the apartment, which took all discomfort from its ex-
tent, and furnished all convenience for solitary study or
detached flirtation. With little respect for the carved
work of the panels, the walls were covered with pictures
brought by Sir Miles from Italy; here and there marble
busts and statues gave lightness to the character of the
room, and harmonized well with that half-Italian mode of
decoration which belongs to the period of James I. The
shape of the chamber, in its divisions, lent itself admi-
rably to that friendly and sociable intermixture of amuse-
ments which reconciles the tastes of young and old. In
the first division, near the fire-place, Sir Miles, seated in
his easy-chair, and sheltered from the opening door by a

sevenfold tapestry screen, was still at chess with his li-
brarian. At a little distance, a middle-aged gentleman,
and three turbaned matrons, were cutting in at whist—
shilling points—with a half-crown bet, optional, and not
much ventured on. On tables, drawn into the recesses of
the windows, were the day's newspapers, Gilray's carica-
tures, the last new publications, and such other ingenious
suggestions to chit-chat. And round these tables grouped
those who had not yet found elsewhere their evening's
amusement; two or three shy young clergymen, the parish
doctor, four or five squires, who felt great interest-in poli-
tics, but never dreamt of the extravagance of taking in a
daily paper, and who now, monopolizing all the journals
they could find, began fairly with the heroic resolution to
skip nothing, from the first advertisement to the printer's
name. Amid one of these groups, Mainwaring had bash-
fully ensconced himself. In the farther division, the chan
delier, suspended from the domed ceiling, threw its cheerful
light over a large circular table below, on which gleamed
the ponderous tea-urn, of massive silver, with its usual
accompaniments. Nor were wanting there, in addition to
those airy nothings sliced infinitesimally from a French
roll the more substantial, and now exiled cheer, of cakes
— plum and seed, Yorkshire and saffron—attesting the
light hand of the housekeeper, and the strong digestion of
the guests. Round this table were seated, in full gossip,
the maids and the matrons, with a slight sprinkling of the
bolder young gentlemen who had been taught to please
the fair. The warmth of the evening allowed the upper

casement to be opened and the curtains drawn aside, and
the July moonlight feebly struggled against the blaze of
the lights within. At this table it was Miss Clavering's
obvious duty to preside; but that was a complaisance to
which she rarely condescended. Nevertheless, she had her
own way of doing the honor of her uncle's house, which
was not without courtesy and grace; to glide from one to
the other, exchange a few friendly words, see that each
set had its well-known amusements, and, finally, sit quietly
down to converse with some who, from gravity or age,
appeared most to neglect, or be neglected by the rest, was
her ordinary, and not unpopular mode of welcoming the
guests at Laughton—not unpopular, for she thus avoided
all interference with the flirtations and conquests of hum-
bler damsels, whom her station and her endowments might
otherwise have crossed or humbled, while she insured the
good word of the old, to whom the young are seldom
so attentive. But if a stranger of more than provincial
repute chanced to be present, if some stray member
of parliament, or barrister on the circuit, or wandering
artist, accompanied any of the neighbors, to him Lucretia
gave more earnest and undivided attention. Him she
sought to draw into a conversation deeper than the usual
babble, and with her calm, searching eyes, bent on him
while he spoke, seemed to fathom the intellect she set in
play. But as yet, this evening, she had not made her ap-
pearance—a sin against etiquette very unusual in her.
Perhaps her recent conversation with Dalibard had ab-
sorbed her thoughts to forgetfulness of the less important

demands on her attention. Her absence had not inter-
fered with the gayety at the tea-table, which was frank
even to noisiness; as it centered round the laughing face
of Ardworth, who, though unknown to most or all of the
ladies present, beyond a brief introduction to one or two
of the first comers from Sir Miles (as the host had risen
from his chess to bid them welcome), had already con-
trived to make himself perfectly at home and outrageously
popular. Niched between two bouncing lasses, he had
commenced acquaintance with them in a strain of familiar
drollery and fun, which had soon broadened its circle, and
now embraced the whole group in the happy contagion of
good humor and young animal spirits. Gabriel, allowed
to sit up later than his usual hour, had not, as might have
been expected, attached himself to this circle, nor indeed
to any ; he might be seen moving quietly about—now
contemplating the pictures on the wall with a curious eye
—now pausing at the whist-table, and noting the game
with the interest of an embryo gamester—now throwing
himself on an ottoman, and trying to coax toward him
Dash or Ponto—trying in vain, for both the dogs abhorred
him; yet still, through all this general movement, had any
one taken the pains to observe him closely, it might have
been sufficiently apparent that his keen, bright, restless eye,
from the corner of its long sly lids, roved chiefly toward
the three persons whom he approached the least—his
father, Mainwaring, and Mr. Vernon. This last had en-
sconced himself apart from all, in the angle formed by one
of the pilasters of the arch that divided the room, so that

he was in command, as it were, of both sections. Re-
clined, with the careless grace that seemed inseparable
from every attitude and motion of his person, in one of
the great velvet chairs, with a book in his hand, which, to .
say truth, was turned upside down, but in the lecture of
which he seemed absorbed—he heard at one hand the
mirthful laughter that circled round young Ardworth, or,
in its pauses, caught, on the other side, muttered exclama-
tions from the grave whist-players—“If you had but
trumped that diamond, ma'am!”—“Bless me, sir, it was
the best heart!” And somehow or other, both the laugh-
ter and exclamations affected him alike, with what then
was called “the spleen.”—for the one reminded him of his
own young days of joyous, careless mirth, of which his
mechanical gayety now was but a mocking ghost, and the
other seemed a satire, a parody, on the fierce but noiseless
rapture of gaming, through which his passions had passed
—when thousands had slipped away with a bland smile,
provoking not one of those natural ebullitions of emotion
which there accompanied the loss of a shilling point. And
besides this, Vernon had been so accustomed to the success
of the drawing-room, to be a somebody and a something
in the company of wits and princes, that he felt, for the
first time, a sense of insignificance in this provincial circle.
Those fat squires had heard nothing of Mr. Vernon, ex-
cept that he would not have Laughton—he had no acres,
no vote in their county—he was a nobody to them. Those
ruddy maidens, though now and then, indeed, one or two
might steal an admiring glance at a figure of elegance so

unusual, regarded him not with the female interest he had
been accustomed to inspire. They felt instinctively that
he could be nothing to them, nor they to him—a mere
London fop, and not half so handsome as Squires Bluff
and Chuff.
Rousing himself from this little vexation to his vanity,
with a conscious smile at his own weakness, Vernon turned
his looks toward the door, waiting for Lucretia's entrance,
and, since her uncle's address to him, feeling that new and
indescribable interest in her appearance, which is apt to
steal into every breast, when what was before but an indif.
ferent acquaintance is suddenly enhaloed with the light of
a possible wife. At length, the door opened, and Lucretia
entered. Mr. Vernon lowered his book, and gazed with
an earnestness that partook both of doubt and admiration.
Lucretia Clavering was tall—tall beyond what is ad-
mitted to be tall in woman; but in her height there was
nothing either awkward or masculine—a figure more per-
fect never served for model to a sculptor. The dress at
that day, unbecoming as we now deem it, was not to her—
at least, on the whole—disadvantageous. The short waist
gave greater sweep to her majestic length of limb, while
the classic thinness of the drapery betrayed the exact pro-
portion and the exquisite contour. The arms then were
worn bare almost to the shoulder, and Lucretia's arms were
not more faultless in shape than dazzling in their snowy
color—the stately neck, the falling shoulders, the firm,
slight, yet rounded bust—all would have charmed equally
the artist and the sensualist. Fortunately, the sole defect

of her form was not apparent at a distance: that defect
was in the hand; it had not the usual faults of female
youthfulness—the superfluity of flesh, the too rosy health-
fulness of color; on the contrary, it was small and thin,
but it was, nevertheless, more the hand of a man than a
woman; the shape had a man's nervous distinctness, the
veins swelled like sinews, the joints of the fingers were .
marked and prominent. In that hand, it almost seemed as
if the iron force of the character betrayed itself. But as
we have said, this slight defect, which few, if seen, would
hypercritically notice, could not of course be perceptible as
she moved slowly up the room; and Vernon's eye, glancing
over the noble figure, rested upon the face. Was it hand-
some?—was it repelling 7 Strange that in feature it had
pretensions to the highest order of beauty, and yet, even
that experienced connoisseur in female charms was almost
puzzled what sentence to pronounce. The hair, as was the
fashion of the day, clustered in profuse curls over the fore-
head, but could not conceal a slight line or wrinkle between
the brows; and this line, rare in women at any age, rare
even in men at hers, gave an expression at once of thought
and sternness to the whole face. The eyebrows themselves
were straight, and not strongly marked—a shade or two
perhaps too light, a fault still more apparent in the lashes;
the eyes were large, full, and, though bright, astonishingly
calm and deep, at least in ordinary moments; yet withal
they wanted the charm of that steadfast and open look,
which goes at once to the heart and invites its trust; their
expression was rather vague and abstracted. She usually

looked aslant while she spoke, and this, which with some
appears but shyness, in one so self-collected had an air of
falsehood. But when, at times, if earnest, and bent rather
on examining those she addressed than guarding herself
from penetration, she fixed those eyes upon you with sud-
den and direct scrutiny, the gaze impressed you powerfully,
and haunted you with a strange spell. The eye itself was
of a peculiar and displeasing color—not blue, nor gray,
nor black, nor hazel, but rather of that cat-like green,
which is drowsy in the light and vivid in the shade. The
profile was purely Greek, and so seen, Lucretia's beauty
seemed incontestable; but in front face, and still more
when inclined between the two, all the features took a
sharpness, that, however regular, had something chilling
and severe; the mouth was small, but the lips were thin
and pale, and had an expression of effort and contraction,
which added to the distrust that her sidelong glance was
calculated to inspire. The teeth were dazzlingly white,
but sharp and thin, and the eye-teeth were much longer
than the rest. The complexion was pale, but without
much delicacy; the paleness seemed not natural to it, but
rather that hue which study and late vigils give to men;
so that she wanted the freshness and bloom of youth, and
looked older than she was—an effect confirmed by an ab-
sence of roundness in the cheek, not noticeable in the
profile, but rendering the front face somewhat harsh as
well as sharp. In a word, the face and the figure were
not in harmony; the figure prevented you from pronounc-
ing her to be masculine—the face took from the figure the

charm of feminacy. It was the head of the young Augustus
upon the form of Agrippina. One touch more, and we
close a description, which already perhaps the reader may
consider frivolously minute. If you had placed before the
mouth and lower part of the face a mask or bandage, the
whole character of the upper face would have changed at
once; the eye lost its glittering falseness, the brow its
sinister contraction; you would have pronounced the face
not only beautiful, but sweet and womanly. Take that
bandage suddenly away, and the change would have startled
you, and startled you the more, because you could detect
no sufficient defect or disproportion in the lower part of
the countenance to explain it. It was as if the mouth was
the key to the whole: the key nothing without the text,
the text uncomprehended without the key.
Such, then, was Lucretia Clavering in outward appear-
ance, at the age of twenty—striking to the most careless
eye–interesting and perplexing the student in that dark
language, never yet deciphered,—the human countenance.
The reader must have observed, that the effect every face
that he remarks for the first time produces, is different
from the impression it leaves upon him when habitually
seen. Perhaps, no two persons differ more from each
other, than does the same countenance in our earliest
recollection of it, from the countenance regarded in the
familiarity of repeated intercourse. And this was especially
the case with Lucretia Clavering's; the first impulse of
nearly all who beheld it was distrust that partook of fear:
it almost inspired you with a sense of danger. The judg-

ment rose up against it; the heart set itself on its guard.
But this uneasy sentiment soon died away with most ob-
servers, in admiration at the chiseled outline, which, like
the Grecian sculpture, gained the more the more it was
examined; in respect for the intellectual power of the
expression; and in fascinated pleasure at the charm of a
smile, rarely employed, it is true, but the more attractive,
both for that reason and for its sudden effect in giving
brightness and persuasion to an aspect that needed them
so much. It was literally like the abrupt breaking out of
a sunbeam; and the repellent impression of the face, thus
familiarized away, the matchless form took its natural in-
fluence; so that, while one who but saw Lucretia for a
moment, might have pronounced her almost plain, and
certainly not prepossessing in appearance, those with whom
she lived, those whom she sought to please, those who saw
her daily, united in acknowledgment of her beauty; and if
they still felt awe, attributed it only to the force of her
understanding.
As she now came midway up the room, Gabriel started
from his seat and ran to her caressingly. Lucretia bent
down, and placed her hand upon his fair locks. As she
did so, he whispered:
“Mr. Vernon has been watching for you.”
“Hush! Where is your father?”
“Behind the screen, at chess with Sir Miles.”
“With Sir Miles!” and Lucretia's eye fell, with the
direct gaze we have before referred to, upon the boy's
face.

“I have been looking over them pretty often,” said he,
meaningly: “they have talked of nothing but the game.”
Lucretia lifted her head, and glanced round with her
furtive eye; the boy divined the search, and with a scarce
\perceptible gesture pointed her attention to Mainwaring's
retreat. Her vivid smile passed over her lips, as she
bowed slightly to her lover, and then withdrawing the
hand which Gabriel had taken in his own, she moved on,
passed Vernon with a commonplace word or two, and was
soon exchanging greetings with the gay merry-makers in
the farther part of the room. A few minutes afterward,
the servants entered, the tea-table was removed, chairs
thrust back—a single lady of a certain age volunteered
her services at the piano, and dancing began within the
ample space which the arch fenced off from the whist-
players. Vernon had watched his opportunity, and at
the first sound of the piano had gained Lucretia's side,
and with grave politeness pre-engaged her hand for the
opening dance.
At that day, though it is not so very long ago, gentle-
men were not ashamed to dance, and to dance well; it
was no languid saunter through a quadrille; it was fair,
deliberate, skillful dancing, among the courtly; free, bound-
ing movement, among the gay.
Vernon, as might be expected, was the most admired
performer of the evening; but he was thinking very little
of the notice he at last excited; he was employing such
ingenuity as his experience of life supplied to the defi-
eiencies of a very imperfect education, limited to the little

flogged into him at Eton, in deciphering the character and
getting at the heart of his fair partner.
“I wonder you do not make Sir Miles take you to
London, my cousin, if you will allow me to call you so.
You ought to have been presented.”
“I have no wish to go to London yet.”
“Yet!” said Mr. Vernon, with the somewhat fade gal-
lantry of his day; “beauty even like yours has little time
to spare.” -
“Hands across, hands across!" cried Mr. Ardworth.
“And,” continued Mr. Vernon, as soon as a pause
was permitted to him, “there is a song which the prince
sings, written by some sensible old-fashioned fellow, which
says:
“Gather your rosebuds while you may,
For Time is still a-flying.’”
“You have obeyed the moral of the song yourself, I
believe, Mr. Wernon.”
“Call me cousin, or Charles—Charley, if you like—as
most of my friends do : nobody ever calls me Mr. Vernon;
I don't know myself by that name.”
“Down the middle, we are all waiting for you,” shouted
Ardworth.
And down the middle with wondrous grace glided the
exquisite nankins of Charley Vernon.
The dance now, thanks to Ardworth, became too ani-
mated and riotous to allow more than a few broken mono-
syllables till Vernon and his partner gained the end of the
set, and then, flirting his partner's fan, he recommenced:

96 LU CRETIA.
“Seriously, my cousin, you must sometimes feel very
much moped here.”
“Never!” answered Lucretia. Not once yet had her
eye rested on Mr. Vernon. She felt that she was sounded.
“Yet I am sure you have a taste for the pomps and
vanities. Aha! there is ambition under those careless
curls,” said Mr. Vernon, with his easy adorable imperti-
nence.
Lucretia winced. º
“But if I were ambitious, what field for ambition could
I find in London?”
“The same as Alexander—empire, my cousin.”
“You forget that I am not a man. Man, indeed, may
hope for an empire. It is something to be a Pitt, or even
a Warren Hastings.”
Mr. Vernon stared. Was this stupidity, or what?
“A woman has an empire more undisputed than Mr.
Pitt's, and more pitiless than that of Governor Hastings.”
“Oh, pardon me, Mr. Vernon »
“Charles, if you please.”
Lucretia's brow darkened.
“Pardon me,” she repeated; “but these compliments,
if such they are meant to be, meet a very ungrateful re-
turn. A woman's empire over gauzes and ribbons, over
tea-tables and drums, over fops and coquettes, is not
worth a journey from Laughton to London.”
“You think you can despise admiration ?”
“What you mean by admiration—yes.”
“And love, too 7” said Vernon, in a whisper.

Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to
her partner. Was he aiming at her secret?—was he hint-
ing at intentions of his own 7 The look chilled Vernon,
and he turned away his head.
Suddenly, then, in pursuance of a new train of ideas,
Lucretia altered her manner to him. She had detected
what before she had surmised. This sudden familiarity on
his part arose from notions her uncle had instilled—the
visitor had been incited to become the suitor. Her pene-
tration into character, which from childhood had been her
passionate study, told her that on that light, polished, fear-
less nature, scorn would have slight effect; to meet the
familiarity would be the best means to secure a friend, to
disarm a wooer. She changed then her manner: she
summoned up her extraordinary craft: she accepted the
intimacy held out to her, not to unguard herself, but to
lay open her opponent. It became necessary to her to
know this man, to have such power as the knowledge
might give her. Insensibly and gradually she led her
companion away from his design of approaching her own
secrets or character, into frank talk about himself. All
unconsciously he began to lay bare to his listener the in-
firmities of his erring, open heart. Silently she looked
down, and plumbed them all : the frivolity, the reckless-
ness, the half gay, half mournful sense of waste and ruin.
There, blooming among the wrecks, she saw the fairest
flowers of noble manhood, profuse and fragrant still–
generosity and courage, and disregard for self. Spend-
thrift and gambler on one side the medal; gentleman and

soldier on the other. Beside this maimed and imperfect
nature she measured her own prepared and profound in-
tellect, and as she listened, her smile became more bland
and frequent. She could afford to be gracious; she felt
superiority, scorn, and safety.
As this seeming intimacy had matured, Vernon and his
partner had quitted the dance, and were conversing apart
in the recess of one of the windows, which the newspaper
readers had deserted, in the part of the room where Sir
Miles and Dalibard, still seated, were about to commence
their third game at chess. The baronet's hand ceased
from the task of arranging his pawns, his eye was upon
the pair, and then, after a long and complacent gaze, it
looked round without discovering the object it sought.
“I am about to task your kindness most improperly,
Monsieur Dalibard,” said Sir Miles, with that politeness
so displeasing to Ardworth, “but will you do me the favor
to move aside that fold of the screen 7 I wish for a better
view of our young people. Thank you very much.”
Sir Miles now discovered Mainwaring, and observed
that far from regarding with self-betraying jealousy the
apparent flirtation going on between Lucretia and her
kinsman, he was engaged in animated conversation with
the chairman of the quarter sessions. Sir Miles was satis-
fied, and ranged his pawns. All this time, and indeed
ever since they had sat down to play, the Provençal had
been waiting, with the patience that belonged to his char-
acter, for some observation from Sir Miles on the subject,
which his sagacity perceived was engrossing his thoughts.

There had been about the old gentleman a fidgety restless.
ness, which showed that something was on his mind. His
eyes had been frequently turned toward his niece since her
entrance; once or twice he had cleared his throat and
hemmed,—his usual prelude to some more important com-
munication; and Dalibard had heard him muttering to
himself, and fancied he caught the name of “Mainwaring.”
And indeed the baronet had been repeatedly on the verge
of sounding his secretary, and as often had been checked
both by pride in himself and pride for Lucretia. It seemed
to him beneath his own dignity and hers even to hint to an
inferior a fear, a doubt of the heiress of Laughton. Olivier
Dalibard could easily have led on his patron—he could
easily, if he pleased it, have dropped words to instill sus-
picion and prompt question, but that was not his object;
he rather shunned than courted any reference to himself
upon the matter; for he knew that Lucretia, if she could
suppose that he, however indirectly, had betrayed her to
her uncle, would at once declare his own suit to her, and
so procure his immediate dismissal; while aware of her
powers of dissimulation, and her influence over her uncle,
he feared that a single word from her would suffice to
remove all suspicion in Sir Miles, however ingeniously
implanted and however truthfully grounded. But all the
while, under his apparent calm, his mind was busy and his
passion burning.
“Pshaw, your old play—the bishop again " said Sir
Miles, laughing, as he moved a knight to frustrate his
adversary's supposed plan; and then turning back, he

once more contemplated the growing familiarity between
Vernon and his niece. This time he could not contain his
pleasure; “Dalibard, my dear sir,” he said, rubbing his
hands, “look yonder; they would make a handsome couple!”
“Who, sir?” said the Provençal, looking another way,
with dogged stupidity.
“Who? damn it, man 1 nay, pray forgive my ill manners
—but I felt glad, sir, and proud, sir. Who? Charley
Vernon and Lucretia Clavering.”
“Assuredly, yes. Do you think that there is a chance
of so happy an event?”
“Why, it depends only on Lucretia; I shall never force
her.” Here Sir Miles stopped, for Gabriel, unperceived
before, picked up his patron's pocket-handkerchief.
Olivier Dalibard's gray eyes rested coldly on his son.
“You are not dancing to night, my boy. Go; I like to
see you amused.” -
The boy obeyed at once, as he always did, the paternal
commands.-He found a partner, and joined a dance just
began; and in the midst of the dance, Honoré Gabriel
Warney seemed a new being : not Ardworth himself so
thoroughly entered into the enjoyment of the exercise, the
lights, the music. With brilliant eyes and dilated nostrils,
he seemed prematurely to feel all that is exciting and
voluptuous in that exhilaration, which to childhood is
usually so innocent. His glances followed the fairest
form; his clasp lingered in the softest hand; his voice
trembled as the warm breath of his partner came on his
cheeks.


## p. 101 (#107) ############################################

LUCRETIA. 101
Meanwhile, the conversation between the chess-players
continued.
“Yes,” said the baronet, “it depends only on Lucretia,
—and she seems pleased with Vernon; who would not
be?”
“Yotr penetration rarely deceives you, sir. I own I
think with you. Does Mr. Vernon know that you would
permit the alliance?”
“Yes; but ” the baronet stopped short.
“You were saying, but—but what, Sir Miles 7"
“Why, the dog affected diffidence; he had some feat
lest he should not win her affections—but luckily, at least,
they are disengaged.”
Dalibard looked grave, and his eye, as if involuntarily,
glanced toward Mainwaring. As ill luck would have it,
the young man had then ceased his conversation with the
chairman of the quarter sessions, and with arms folded,
brow contracted, and looks earnest, anxious, and intent,
was contemplating the whispered conference between Lu-
cretia and Vernon.
Sir Miles's eye had followed his secretary's, and his face
changed. His hand fell on the chess-board, and upset half
the men; he uttered a very audible “Zounds !”
“I think, Sir Miles,” said the Provençal, rising as if
conscious that Sir Miles wished to play no more, “I
think that if you spoke soon to Miss Clavering, as to your
views with regard to Mr. Vernon, it might ripen matters;
for I have heard it said by French mothers — and our
French women understand the female heart, sir—that a

girl having no other affection is often prepossessed at
once in favor of a man whom she knows beforehand is
prepared to woo and to win her, whereas without that
knowledge, he would have seemed but an ordinary ac-
quaintance.”
“It is shrewdly said, my dear Monsieur Dalibard; and
for more reasons than one, the sooner I speak to her the
better. Lend me your arm—it is time for supper—I see
the dance is over.”
Passing by the place where Mainwaring still leant, the
baronet looked at him fixedly. The young man did not
notice the gaze. Sir Miles touched him gently. He started
as from a reverie :
“You have not danced, Mr. Mainwaring.”
“I dance so seldom, Sir Miles,” said Mainwaring,
coloring.
“Ahl you employ your head more than your heels,
young gentleman; very right—I must speak to you to-
morrow. Well, ladies, I hope you have enjoyed yourselves.

the lights of heaven, and they came bright and still
through the casements: Moonbeam and Starbeam, they

that march, rank upon rank, into their kingdom of soli-
tude. Down the oak stairs, from the casements, blazoned
with heraldry, moved the rays, creepingly, fearfully. On
the armor in the hall clustered the rays boldly and brightly,
till the steel shone out like a mirror. In the library, long
and low, they just entered, stopped short—it was no place
for their play. In the drawing-room, now deserted, they
were more curious and adventurous. Through the large
window, still open, they came in freely and archly, as if to
spy what had caused such disorder; the stiff chairs out of
place, the smooth floor despoiled of its carpet—that flower
dropped on the ground—that scarf forgotten on the table
—the rays lingered upon them all. Up and down, through
the house, from the base to the roof, roved the children of
the air, and found but two spirits awake amid the slum-
ber of the rest.
In that tower to the east—in the tapestry chamber–
with the large gilded bed in the recess, came the rays,
tamed and wan, as if scared by the grosser light on the
table. By that table sat a girl, her brow leaning on one
hand; in the other she held a rose—it is a love-token—
exchanged with its sister rose, by stealth—in mute sign
of reproach for doubt excited—an assurance and a recon-
ciliation. A love-token l—shrink not, ye rays—there is
something akin to you in love. But, see, the hand closes
convulsively on the flower—it hides it not in the breast—
it lifts it not to the lip; it throws it passionately aside.

and to think that will here cannot shorten an hour !” Then

she rose, and walked to and fro, and each time she gained
a certain niche in the chamber she paused, and then irres-
olutely passed on again. What is in that niche : Only
books. What can books teach thee, pale girl? The step

that clasped the flower takes down a volume. The girl

The sharpest test of those nerves, upon which depends
the mere animal courage, is to be roused suddenly, in the
depth of night, by a violent hand. The impulse of Gabriel,
thus startled, was neither of timidity nor surprise. It was
that of some Spartan boy, not new to danger: with a
slight cry, and a fierce spring, the son's hand clutched at
the father's throat. Dalibard shook him off with an effort,
and a smile, half in approval half in irony, played by the
moonlight over his lips.
“Blood will out, young tiger,” said he. “Hush, and
hear me!”
“Is it you, father ?” said Gabriel; “I thought, — I
dreamed 77 -
“No matter; think—dream always, that man should be
prepared for defense from perill”
“Gabriel,” and the pale scholar seated himself on the
bed, “turn your face to mine—nearer; let the moon fall
on it; lift your eyes—look at me—so l Are you not play-
ing false to me? Are you not Lucretia's spy, while you
are pretending to be mine : It is so; your eye betrays
you. Now, heed me; you have a mind beyond your years.

fare and squalid dress, or your lodgment here, the sense
of luxury, the sight of splendor, the atmosphere of wealth?

“I choose as you would have me, then,” said the boy—
“the last.”
“I believe you. Attend l you do not love me—that is
natural—you are the son of Clara Warney ! You have

supposed that in loving Lucretia Clavering you might vex
or thwart me, you scarce knew how; and Lucretia Claver-
ing has gold and gifts, and soft words, and promises, to
bribe withal. I now tell you openly my plan with regard
to this girl : it is my aim to marry her—to be master of
this house and these lands. If I succeed, you share them
with me. By betraying me, word or look, to Lucretia,
you frustrate this aim ; you plot against our rise and to
our ruin. Deem not that you could escape my fall; if I
am driven hence—as you might drive me—you share my
fate; and, mark me, you are delivered up to my revengel
You cease to be my son—you are my foe. Child l you
know me.”
The boy, bold as he was, shuddered; but after a pause,
so brief that a breath scarce passed between his silence
and his words, he replied, with emphasis:
“Father, you have read my heart. I have been per-
suaded by Lucretia (for she bewitches me) to watch you
—at least, when you are with Sir Miles. I knew that this
was mixed up with Mr. Mainwaring. Now that you have
made me understand your own views, I will be true to you
—true without threats.”
The father looked hard on him, and seemed satisfied
with the gaze. “Remember, at least, that your future rests
upon your truth: that is no threat—that is a thought of
hope. Now sleep or muse on it.” He dropped the curtain
which his hand had drawn aside, and stole from the room
as noiselessly as he had entered. The boy slept no more.
Deceit, and cupidity, and corrupt ambition were at work

child's brow play the demons who had followed the father's
step to his bed of sleep.
Back to his own room, close at hand, crept Olivier Dali
bard. The walls were lined with books—many in language
and deep in lore. Moon and Starbeam, ye love the mid-
night solitude of the scholar ! The Provençal stole to the
easement, and looked forth. All was serene; breathless
trees, and gleaming sculpture, and whitened sward, girdled
by the mass of shadow. Of what thought the man? not of
the present loveliness which the scene gave to his eye, nor
of the future mysteries which the stars should whisper to
the soul. Gloomily over a stormy and a hideous past
roved the memory, stored with fraud and foul with crime;
plan upon plan, schemed with ruthless wisdom, followed
up by remorseless daring, and yet all now a ruin and a
blank!—an intellect at war with good, and the good had
conquered l But the conviction neither touched the con-
science nor enlightened the reason; he felt, it is true, a
moody sense of impotence, but it brought rage, not de-
spondency: it was not that he submitted to Good, as too
powerful to oppose, but that he deemed he had not yet
gained all the mastery over the arsenal of Evil. And evil
he called it not. Good and evil to him were but subordi-
nate genii, at the command of Mind; they were the slaves
of the lamp. But had he got at the true secret of the
lamp itself? “How is it,” he thought, as he turned im-
patiently from the casement, “that I am baffled here, where
my fortunes seemed most assured 7 Here the mind has

the merest commonplace in the vulgar lives of mortals—

taught her to despise—one of the stock gallants of a comedy

the stage starts up, and the fabric of years is overthrown.”
As he thus mused, he placed his hand upon a small box on
one of the tables. “Yet, within this,” resumed his solilo-
quy, and he struck the lid, that gave back a dull sound,—
“within this I hold the keys of life and death! Fool, the

CONFERENCES.
THE next day Sir Miles did not appear at breakfast;
not that he was unwell, but that he meditated holding
certain audiences, and on such occasions the good old
gentleman liked to prepare himself. He belonged to a
school in which, amid much that was hearty and convivial,
there was much also that, nowadays, would seem stiff
and formal, contrasting the other school immediately suc.
ceeding him, which Mr. Vernon represented, and of which
the Charles Surface of Sheridan is a faithful and admirable
type. The room that Sir Miles appropriated to himself
was, properly speaking, the state apartment, called, in the
old inventories, “King J ames's chamber;” it was on the
first floor, communicating with the picture-gallery, which, at
the farther end, opened upon a corridor, admitting to the
principal bed-rooms. As Sir Miles cared nothing for holi-
day state, he had unscrupulously taken his cubiculum in
this chamber, which was really the handsomest in the house,
except the banquet hall; placed his bed in one angle, with
a huge screen before it, filled up the space with his Italian
antiques and curiosities, and fixed his favorite pictures on
the faded gilt leather paneled on the walls. His main
motive in this was the communication with the adjoining

gallery, which, when the weather was unfavorable, furnished
ample room for his habitual walk. He knew how many
strides by the help of his crutch made a mile, and this was
convenient. Moreover, he liked to look, when alone, on
those old portraits of his ancestors, which he had reli-
giously conserved in their places, preferring to thrust his
Florentine and Venetian master-pieces into bed-rooms and
parlors rather than to dislodge from the gallery the stiff
ruffs, doublets, and fardingales of his predecessors. It was
whispered in the house that the baronet, whenever he had
to reprove a tenant, or lecture a dependent, took care to
have him brought to his sanctum, through the full length
of this gallery, so that the victim might be duly prepared
and awed by the imposing effect of so stately a journey,
and the grave faces of all the generations of St. John,
which could not fail to impress him with the dignity of the
family, and alarm him at the prospect of the injured frown
of its representative. Across this gallery now, following
the steps of the powdered valet, strode young Ardworth;
staring now and then at some portrait more than usually
grim, more often wondering why his boots, that never
creaked before, should creak on those particular boards,
and feeling a quiet curiosity, without the least mixture of
fear or awe, as to what old Square-toes intended to say to
him. But all feeling of irreverence ceased when, shown
into the baronet's room, and the door closed, Sir Miles
rose with a smile and cordially shaking his hand, said,
dropping the punctilious courtesy of Mister—“Ardworth,
sir, if I had a little prejudice against you, before you came,

you have conquered it. You are a fine, manly, spirited
fellow, sir; and you have an old man's good wishes,
which are no bad beginning to a young man's good for-
tunes.”
The color rushed over Ardworth's forehead, and a tear
sprang to his eyes. He felt a rising at his throat, as he
stammered out some not very audible reply.
“I wished to see you, young gentleman, that I might
judge myself what you would like best, and what would
best fit you. Your father is in the army; what say you to
a pair of colors?”
“Oh, Sir Miles, that is my utmost ambition! Anything
but law, except the church; anything but the church,
except a desk and a counterl”
The baronet, much pleased, gave him a gentle pat on
the shoulder. “Ha, ha! we gentlemen, you see (for the
Ardworths are very well born—very), we gentlemen under-
stand each otherl Between you and me, I never liked the
law—never thought a man of birth should belong to it—
take money for lying—shabby—shocking ! Don't let that
go any further! The church—Mother Church—I honor
her! Church and state go togetherl But one ought to
be very good to preach to others—better than you and I
are—eh, eh? ha, ha! Well, then, you like the army—
there's a letter for you to the Horse Guards—go up to
town—your business is done; and, as for your outfit—read
this little book at your leisure.” And Sir Miles thrust a
pocket-book into Ardworth's hand.
“But pardon me,” said the young man, much bewildered.

“What claim have I, Sir Miles, to such generosity? I know
that my uncle offended you.”
“Sir, that's the claim 1" said Sir Miles, gravely. “I
cannot live long !” he added, with a touch of melancholy
in his voice; “let me die in peace with all l—perhaps I
injured your uncle? Who knows but, if so, he hears and
pardons me now 7"
“Oh, Sir Miles 1” exclaimed the thoughtless, generous-
hearted young man, “and my little playfellow, Susan, your
own niece l’”
Sir Miles drew back haughtily; but the burst that of.
fended him rose so evidently from the heart, was so ex-
cusable from its motive, and the youth's ignorance of the
world, that his frown soon vanished, as he said, calmly and
gravely:
“No man, my good sir, can allow to others the right to
touch on his family affairs; I trust I shall be just to the
poor young lady; and so, if we never meet again, let us
think well of each other. Go, my boy! serve your king
and your country!”
“I will do my best, Sir Miles, if only to merit your
kindness.” f
“Stay a moment: you are intimate, I find, with young
Mainwaring 7”
“An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”
“The army will not do for him, eh?”
“He is too clever for it, sir.”
“Ah, he'd make a lawyer, I suppose—glib tongue
enoughl and can talk well,—and lie, if he's paid for it?”

“I don't know how lawyers regard these matters, Sir
Miles; but if you don't make him a lawyer, I am sure you
must leave him an honest man.”
“Really and truly 37
“Upon my honor I think so.”
“Good day to you, and good luck. You must catch
the coach at the lodge; for, I see by the papers, that, in
spite of all the talk about Peace, they are raising regi-
ments like wildfire.”
With very different feelings from those with which he
had entered the room, Ardworth quitted it. He hurried
into his own chamber to thrust his clothes into his port-
manteau, and, while thus employed, Mainwaring entered.
“Joy, my dear fellow I wish me joy! I am going to
town—into the army—abroad—to be shot at, thank
Heaven l That dear old gentleman l—just throw me that
coat, will you?”
A very few more words sufficed to explain what had
passed to Mainwaring; he sighed when his friend had
finished: “I wish I were going with you!”
“Do you? Sir Miles has only got to write another
letter to the Horse Guards; but no, you are meant to be
something better than food for powder; and, besides, your
Iucretial Hang it, I am sorry I cannot stay to examine
her as I had promised; but I have seen enough to know
that she certainly loves you. Ah, when she changed

still, do you know, Will, now that Sir Miles has spoken to
me so, that I could have sobbed—‘God bless you, my old
boy!”—'pon my life, I could l—now, do you know, that I
feel enraged with you for abetting that girl to deceive
him.”
“I am enraged with myself; and—” Here a servant
entered, and informed Mainwaring that he had been search-
ing for him—Sir Miles requested to see him in his room.
Mainwaring started like a culprit. “Never fear,” whispered
Ardworth; “he has no suspicion of you, I'm sure. Shake
hands; when shall we meet again? Is it not odd, I, who
am a Republican by theory, taking King George's pay to
fight against the French 7 No use stopping now to moral-
ize on such contradictions. John–Tom, what's your
name—here, my man, here, throw that portmanteau on
your shoulder, and come to the lodge.” And so, full of
health, hope, vivacity, and spirit, John Walter Ardworth
departed on his career.
Meanwhile, Mainwaring slowly took his way to Sir
Miles. As he approached the gallery, he met Lucretia,
who was coming from her own room. “Sir Miles has
sent for me,” he said, meaningly. He had time for no
more, for the valet was at the door of the gallery, waiting
to usher him to his host.
“Ha! you will say not a word that can betray us;
guard your looks, tool” whispered Lucretia, hurriedly;
“afterward, join me by the cedars.” She passed on to-
ward the staircase, and glanced at the large clock that was
placed there. “Past eleven; Wernon is never up before

twelve. I must see him before my uncle sends for me, as ,
he will send if he suspects ” She paused, went back
to her room, rang/for her maid, dressed as for walking,
and said, carelessly, “If Sir Miles wants me, I am gone to
the rectory, and shall probably return by the village, so
that I shall be back about one.” Toward the rectory, in-
deed, Lucretia bent her way; but half way there, turned
back, and passing through the plantation at the rear of
the house, awaited Mainwaring on the bench beneath the
cedars. He was not long before he joined her. His face
was sad and thoughtful; and when he seated himself by
her side, it was with a weariness of spirit that alarmed
her.
“Well,” said she, fearfully, and she placed her hand
on his.
“Oh, Lucretia,” he exclaimed, as he pressed that hand
with an emotion that came from other passions than love,
“we, or rather I, have done great wrong. I have been
leading you to betray your uncle's trust, to convert your
gratitude to him into hypocrisy. I have been unworthy of
myself—I am poor—I am humbly born; but till I came
here, I was rich and proud in honor. I am not so now.
Lucretia, pardon me—pardon me! let the dream be over
—we must not sin thus; for it is sin, and the worst of sin
—treachery. We must part: forget me !” -
“Forget you ! never, never, never !” cried Lucretia,
with suppressed, but most earnest vehemence—her breast
heaving, her hands, as he dropped the one he held, clasped
together, her eyes full of tears—transformed at once into

softness, meekness, even while racked by passion and de-
spair.
“Oh, William, say anything—reproach, chide, despise
me, for mine is all the fault; say anything but that word
—‘part.” I have chosen you, I have sought you out, I
have wooed you if you will; be it so. I cling to you–
you are my all—all that saves me from—from myself,” she
added, falteringly, and in a hollow voice. “Your love—
you know not what it is to me ! I scarcely knew it myself
before. I feel what it is now, when you say ‘part.”
Agitated and tortured, Mainwaring writhed at these
burning words, bent his face low, and covered it with his
hands.
He felt her clasp struggling to withdraw them, yielded,
and saw her kneeling at his feet. His manhood, and his
gratitude, and his heart, all moved by that sight in one so
haughty, he opened his arms, and she fell on his breast.
“You will never say ‘part’ again, William I" she gasped,
convulsively.
“But what are we to do?”
“Say, first, what has passed between you and my uncle.”
“Little to relate; for I can repeat words, not tones and
looks. Sir Miles spoke to me, at first kindly and encour-
agingly, about my prospects; said it was time that I should
fix myself; added a few words, with menacing emphasis,
against what he called ‘idle dreams and desultory ambi-
tion,” and observing that I changed countenance—for I
felt that I did—his manner became more cold and severe.
Lucretia, if he has not detected our secret, he more than

suspects my— my presumption. Finally, he said, dryly,
that I had better return home, consult with my father, and
that if I preferred entering into the service of the govern-
ment to any mercantile profession, he thought he had suf.
ficient interest to promote my views. But, clearly and
distinctly, he left on my mind one impression—that my
visits here are over.”
“Did he allude to me—to Mr. Vernon 7”
“Ah, Lucretial do you know him so little—his delicacy,
his pride?”
Lucretia was silent, and Mainwaring continued:
“I felt that I was dismissed; I took my leave of your
uncle; I came hither with the intention to say farewell
forever.”
“Hush, hush | that thought is over ! And you return
to your father's; perhaps better so; it is but hope de-
ferred: and, in your absence, I can the more easily allay
all suspicion, if suspicion exist; but I must write to you;
we must correspond. William, dear William, write often
—write kindly; tell me, in every letter, that you love me
—that you love only me—that you will be patient, and
confide.”
“Dear Lucretia.” said Mainwaring, tenderly, and moved
by the pathos of her earnest and imploring voice: “but
you forget; the bag is always brought first to Sir Miles;
he will recognize my hand; and to whom can you trust
your own letters?”
“True,” replied Lucretia, despondingly; and there was
a pause: suddenly she lifted her head, and cried, “but

your father's house is not far from this—not ten miles—we
can find a spot at the remote end of the park, near the
path through the great wood; there I can leave my let-
ters; there I can find yours.”
“But it must be seldom. If any of Sir Miles's servants
see me, if jj
“Oh, William, William, this is not the language of
love I?"
“Forgive me—I think of you !”
“Love thinks of nothing but itself; it is tyrannical, ab-
sorbing—it forgets even the object loved; it feeds on
danger—it strengthens by obstacles,” said Lucretia, toss-
ing her hair from her forehead, and with an expression of
dark and wild power on her brow and in her eyes: “fear
not for me, I am sufficient guard upon myself; even while
I speak, I think; yes, I have thought of the very spot.
You remember that hollow oak at the bottom of the dell,
in which Guy St. John, the cavalier, is said to have hid
himself from Fairfax's soldiers. Every Monday I will
leave a letter in that hollow; every Tuesday you can
search for it, and leave your own. This is but once a
week; there is no risk here.”
Mainwaring's conscience still smote him; but he had
not the strength to resist the energy of Lucretia. The
force of her character seized upon the weak part of his
own—its gentleness, its fear of inflicting pain, its reluct-
ance to say “no”—that simple cause of misery to the
overtimid. A few sentences more, full of courage, confi-
dence, and passion, on the part of the woman, of constraint,

and yet of soothed and grateful affection, on that of the
man, and the affianced parted.
Mainwaring had already given orders to have his trunks
sent to him at his father's; and, a hardy pedestrian by
habit, he now struck across the park, passed the dell and
the hollow tree, commonly called “Guy's Oak,” and across
woodland and fields golden with ripening corn, took his
way to the town, in the center of which, square, solid, and
imposing, stood the respectable residence of his bustling,
active, electioneering father.
Lucretia's eye followed a form, as fair as ever captivated
maiden's glance, till it was out of sight; and then, as she
emerged from the shade of the cedars into the more open
space of the garden, her usual thoughtful composure was
restored to her steadfast countenance. On the terrace,
she caught sight of Vernon, who had just quitted his own
room, where he always breakfasted alone, and who was
now languidly stretched on a bench and basking in the
sun. Like all who have abused life, Vernon was not the
same man in the early part of the day. The spirits that
rose to temperate heat the third hour after noon, and
expanded into glow when the lights shone over gay
carousers, at morning were flat and exhausted. With
hollow eyes, and that weary fall of the muscles of the
cheeks which betrays the votary of Bacchus, the convivial
three-bottle man—Charley Vernon forced a smile, meant
to be airy and impertinent, to his pale lips, as he rose with
effort, and extended three fingers to his cousin.
“Where have you been hiding 7 catching bloom from

the roses?—you have the prettiest shade of color—just
enough—not a hue too much. And there is Sir Miles's
valet gone to the rectory, and the fat footman puffing away
toward the village, and I, like a faithful warden, from my
post at the castle, all looking out for the truant.”
“But who wants me, cousin 7” said Lucretia, with the
full blaze of her rare and captivating smile.
“The knight of Laughton confessedly wants thee, O
damsel !—the knight of the Bleeding Heart may want thee
more—dare he own it 7”
And with a hand that trembled a little, not with love
—at least it trembled always a little before the Madeira
at luncheon—he lifted hers to his lips.
“Compliments again, words—idle words !” said Lu-
cretia, looking down bashfully.
“How can I convince thee of my sincerity, unless thou
takest my life as its pledge, maid of Laughton 7"
And very much tired of standing, Charley Vernon drew
her gently to the bench, and seated himself by her side.
Lucretia's eyes were still downcast, and she remained
silent; Vernon, suppressing a yawn, felt that he was
bound to continue. There was nothing very formidable
in Lucretia's manner.
“Fore Gad!” thought he, “I suppose I must take the
heiress after all; the sooner’tis over, the sooner I can get
back to Brook Street.”
“It is premature, my fair cousin,” said he aloud—“pre-
mature, after less than a week's visit, and only some four-
teen or fifteen hours' permitted friendship and intimacy,

to say what is uppermost in my thoughts; but we spend-
thrifts are slow at nothing, not even at wooing. By
sweet Wenus, then, fair cousin, you look provokingly hand-
some ! Sir Miles, your good uncle, is pleased to forgive
all my follies and faults, upon one condition, that you will
take on yourself the easy task to reform me. Will you,
my fair cousin 7 Such as I am, you behold me ! I am no
sinner in the disguise of a saint | My fortune is spent—
my health is not strong; but a young widow's is no
mournful position. I am gay when I am well; good tem-
pered when ailing. I never betrayed a trust—can you
trust me with yourself?”
This was a long speech, and Charley Vernon felt pleased
that it was over. There was much in it that would have
touched a heart even closed to him, and a little genuine
emotion had given light to his eyes and color to his cheek.
Amid all the ravages of dissipation, there was something
interesting in his countenance, and manly in his tone and
his gesture. But Lucretia was only sensible to one part
of his confession — her uncle had consented to his suit.
This was all of which she desired to be assured, and against
this she now sought to screen herself.
“Your candor, Mr. Vernon,” she said, avoiding his eyes,
“deserves candor in me. I cannot affect to misunderstand
you;-but you take me by surprise—I was so unprepared
for this. Give me time—I must reflect.”
“Reflection is dull work in the country; you can reflect
more amusingly in town, my fair cousin.”
“I will wait, then, till I find myself in town.”

“Ah, you make me the happiest, the most grateful of
men,” cried Mr. Vernon, rising with a semi-genuflection,
which seemed to imply, “Consider yourself knelt to,” just
as a courteous assailer, with a motion of the hand, implies,
“Consider yourself horsewhipped.”
Lucretia, who, with all her intellect, had no capacity for
humor, recoiled, and looked up in positive surprise.
“I do not understand you, Mr. Vernon,” she said, with
austere gravity.
“Allow me the bliss of flattering myself that you, at
least, are understood,” replied Charley Vernon, with im-
perturbable assurance. “You will wait to reflect till you
are in town—that is to say, the day after our honeymoon,
when you awake in May Fair.”
Before Lucretia could reply, she saw the indefatigable
valet formally approaching, with the anticipated message
that Sir Miles requested to see her. She replied hurriedly
to this last, that she would be with her uncle immediately;
and when he had again disappeared within the porch, she
said, with a constrained effort at frankness:
“Mr. Vernon, if I have misunderstood your words, I
think I do not mistake your character. You cannot wish
to take advantage of my affection for my uncle, and the
passive obedience I owe to him, to force me into a step—
of which—of which—I have not yet sufficiently considered
the results. If you really desire that my feelings should be
consulted, that I should not—pardon me—consider myself
sacrificed to the family pride of my guardian, and the in-
terests of my suitor »

“Madam I" exclaimed Vernon, reddening.
Pleased with the irritating effect her words had pro-
duced, Lucretia continued calmly: “If, in a word, I am
to be a free agent in a choice on which my happiness de-
pends, forbear to urge Sir Miles further at present—forbear
to press your suit upon me. Give me the delay of a few
months; I shall know how to appreciate your delicacy.”
“Miss Clavering,” answered Vernon, with a touch of
the St. John haughtiness, “I am in despair that you
should even think so grave an appeal to my honor neces-
sary. I am well aware of your expectations and my
poverty. And believe me, I would rather rot in a prison
than enrich myself by forcing your inclinations. You have
but to say the word, and I will (as becomes me as man
and gentleman) screen you from all chance of Sir Miles's
displeasure, by taking it on myself to decline an honor of
which I feel, indeed, very undeserving.”
“But I have offended you,” said Lucretia, softly, while
she turned aside to conceal the glad light of her eyes,—
“pardon me; and, to prove that you do so, give me your
arm to my uncle's room.”
Vernon, with rather more of Sir Miles's antiquated stiff-
ness than his own rakish ease, offered his arm, with a pro-
found reverence, to his cousin; and they took their way to
the house. Not till they had passed up the stairs, and
were even in the gallery, did further words pass between
them. Then Vernon said, “But what is your wish, Miss
Clavering 7 On what footing shall I remain here 7”
“Will you suffer me to dictate 7” replied Lucretia,

stopping short with well-feigned confusion, as if suddenly
aware that the right to dictate gives the right to hope.
“Ah, consider me at least as your slave l’” whispered
Vernon, as his eye, resting on the contour of that match-
less neck, partially and advantageously turned from him,
he began, with his constitutional admiration of the sex, to
feel interested in a pursuit that now seemed, after piquing,
to flatter his self-love.
“Then I will use the privilege when we meet again,”
answered Lucretia; and drawing her arm gently from his,
she passed on to her uncle, leaving Vernon midway in the
gallery.
Those faded portraits looked down on her with that
melancholy gloom which the effigies of our dead ancestors
seem mysteriously to acquire. To noble and aspiring
spirits, no homily to truth, and honor, and fair ambition
is more eloquent, than the mute and melancholy canvas,
from which our fathers, made by death our household
gods, contemplate us still. They appear to confide to us
the charge of their unblemished names. They speak to us
from the grave, and, heard aright, the pride of family is
the guardian angel of its heirs. But Lucretia, with her
hard and scholastic mind, despised as the veriest weakness
all the poetry that belongs to the sense of a pure descent.
It was because she was proud as the proudest in herself,
that she had nothing but contempt for the virtue, the
valor, or the wisdom of those that had gone before. So
with a brain busy with guile and stratagem, she trod on
beneath the eyes of the simple and spotless Dead.

Vernon, thus left alone, mused a few moments on what
had passed between himself and the heiress, and then
slowly retracing his steps, his eye roved along the stately
series of his line. “Faith !” he muttered, “if my boyhood
had been passed in this old gallery, his Royal Highness
would have lost a good fellow and hard drinker; and his
Majesty would have had, perhaps, a more distinguished
soldier—certainly, a worthier subject. If I marry this
lady, and we are blessed with a son, he shall walk through
this gallery, once a day, before he is flogged into Latin l’
Lucretia's interview with her uncle was a master-piece of
art. What pity that such craft and subtlety were wasted
in our little day, and on such petty objects; under the
Medici, that spirit had gone far to the shaping of history.
Sure, from her uncle's openness, that he would plunge at
once into the subject for which she deemed she was sum-
moned, she evinced no repugnance, when, tenderly kissing
her, he asked “If Charles Vernon had a chance of win-
ning favor in her eyes?” She knew that she was safe in
saying “No:” that her uncle would never force her incli-
nations: safe so far as Vernon was concerned; but she
desired more; she desired thoroughly to quench all sus-
picion that her heart was preoccupied; entirely to remove
from Sir Miles's thoughts the image of Mainwaring; and
a denial of one suitor might quicken the baronet's eyes to
the concealment of the other. Nor was this all : if Sir
Miles was seriously bent upon seeing her settled in mar-
riage before his death, the dismissal of Vernon might only
expose her to the importunity of new candidates, more

difficult to deal with. Vernon himself she could use as
the shield against the arrows of a host. Therefore when
Sir Miles repeated his question, she answered, with much
gentleness and seeming modest sense, that “Mr. Vernon
had much that must prepossess in his favor; that in addi-
tion to his own advantages he had one, the highest in her
eyes, her uncle's sanction and approval. But,” and she
hesitated with becoming and natural diffidence, “were not
his habits unfixed and roving 7 So it was said; she knew
not herself—she would trust her happiness to her uncle.
But if so, and if Mr. Vernon were really disposed to change,
would it not be prudent to try him—try him where there
was temptation; not in the repose of Laughton, but amid
his own haunts of London f Sir Miles had friends who
would honestly inform him of the result. She did but
suggest this: she was too ready to leave all to her dear
guardian's acuteness and experience.”
Melted by her docility, and in high approval of the
prudence which betokened a more rational judgment than
he himself had evinced, the good old man clasped her to his
breast, and shed tears as he praised and thanked her—she
had decided, as she always did, for the best.—Heaven forbid
that she should be wasted on an incorrigible man of pleas-
ure! “And,” said the frank-hearted gentleman, unable
long to keep any-thought concealed, “and to think that I
could have wronged you, for a moment, my own noble
child !—that I could have been dolt enough to suppose
that the good looks of that boy Mainwaring might have
caused you to forget what—but you change color!”—for

with all her dissimulation, Lucretia loved too ardently not
to shrink at that name thus suddenly pronounced. “Oh,”
continued the baronet, drawing her toward him still more
closely, while with one hand he put back her face that he
might read its expression the more closely,–"oh, if it had
been so—if it be so, I will pity, not blame you, for my
neglect was the fault; pity you, for I have known a similar
struggle; admire you in pity, for you have the spirit or
your ancestors, and you will conquer the weakness. Speak |
have I touched on the truth? Speak without fear, child!
—you have no mother; but in age a man sometimes gets
a mother's heart.”
Startled and alarmed as the lark when the step nears its
nest, Lucretia summoned all the dark wile of her nature to
mislead the intruder. “No, uncle, no; I am not so un-
worthy. You misconceived my emotion.” -
“Ah, you know that he has had the presumption to love
you—the puppy! and you feel the compassion you women
always feel for such offenders? Is that it?”
Rapidly Lucretia considered if it would be wise to leave
that impression on his mind; on one hand, it might ac-
count for a moment's agitation, and if Mainwaring were
detected hovering near the domain, in the exchange of
their correspondence, it might appear but the idle, if hope-
less, romance of youth, which haunts the mere home of its
object;-but no; on the other hand, it left his banishment
absolute and confirmed. Her resolution was taken with a
promptitude that made her pause not perceptible.
“No, my dear uncle,” she said, so cheerfully, that it re-

moved all doubt from the mind of her listener; “but
Monsieur Dalibard has rallied me on the subject, and I
was so angry with him, that when you touched on it I
thought more of my quarrel with him than of poor timid
Mr. Mainwaring himself. Come now, own it, dear sir!
Monsieur Dalibard has instilled this strange fancy into
your head.”
“No, 'Slife: if he had taken such a liberty, I should
have lost my librarian. No, I assure you, it was rather
Vernon: you know true love is jealous.”
“Vernon l’” thought Lucretia; “he must go, and at
once.” Sliding from her uncle's arms to the stool at his
feet, she then led the conversation more familiarly back
into the channel it had lost; and when at last she escaped,
it was with the understanding that, without promise or
compromise, Mr. Vernon should return to London at once,
and be put upon the ordeal, through which she felt assured
it was little likely he should pass with success.

GUY's OAK.
THREE weeks afterward, the life at Laughton seemed
restored to the cheerful and somewhat monotonous tran-
quillity of its course, before chafed and disturbed by the
recent interruptions to the stream. Vernon had de-
parted satisfied with the justice of the trial imposed on
him, and far too high spirited to seek to extort from niece
or uncle any engagement beyond that which, to a nice
sense of honor, the trial itself imposed. His memory and
his heart were still faithful to Mary; but his senses, his
fancy, his vanity were a little involved in his success with
the heiress. Though so free from all mercenary meanness,
Mr. Vernon was still enough man of the world to be sensi-
ble of the advantages of the alliance which had first been
pressed on him by Sir Miles; and from which Lucretia
herself appeared not to be averse. The season of Lºndon
was over, but there was always a set, and that set the one
in which Charley Vernon principally moved, who found
town fuller than the country. Besides, he went occasionally
to Brighton, which was then to England what Baiae was to
Rome. The prince was holding gay court at the Pavilion,
and that was the atmosphere which Vernon was habituated
to breathe. He was no parasite of royalty: he had that
11 * I (129)

130 LU CRETIA.
strong personal affection to the prince which it is often the
good fortune of royalty to attract. Nothing is less founded
than the complaint which poets put into the lips of princes,
that they have no friends; it is, at least, their own per-
verse fault if that be the case—a little amiability, a little
of frank kindness goes so far when it emanates from the
rays of a crown l But Vernon was stronger than Lucretia
deemed him,-once contemplating the prospect of a union
which was to consign to his charge the happiness of
another, and feeling all that he should owe in such a mar-
riage to the confidence both of niece and uncle, he evinced
steadier principles than he had ever made manifest, when
he had only his own fortune to mar and his own happiness
to trifle with. He joined his old companions; but he kept
aloof from their more dissipated pursuits. Beyond what
was then thought the venial error of too devout libations
to Bacchus, Charley Vernon seemed reformed.
Ardworth had joined a regiment, which had departed
for the field of action. Mainwaring was still with his
father, and had not yet announced to Sir Miles any wish
or project for the future.
Olivier Dalibard, as before, passed his mornings alone
in his chamber—his noon and his evenings with Sir Miles.
He avoided all private conferences with Lucretia. She
did not provoke them. Young Gabriel amused himself in
copying Sir Miles's pictures, sketching from Nature, scrib-
bling in his room, prose or verse, no matter which (he
never showed his lucubrations), pinching the dogs when
he could catch them alone, shooting the cats, if they ap-

peared in the plantation, on pretense of love for the young
pheasants, sauntering into the cottages, where he was a
favorite because of his good looks, but where he always
contrived to leave the trace of his visits in disorder and
mischief, upsetting the tea-kettle and scalding the children,
or, what he loved dearly, setting two gossips by the ears.
But these occupations were over by the hour Lucretia left
her apartment. From that time he never left her out of
view; and, when encouraged to join her at his usual privi-
leged times, whether in the gardens at sunset, or in her
evening niche in the drawing-room, he was sleek, silken,
and caressing as Cupid, after plaguing the Nymphs, at the
feet of Psyche. These two strange persons had indeed
apparently that sort of sentimental familiarity which is
sometimes seen between a fair boy and a girl much older
than himself; but the attraction that drew them together
was an indefinable instinct of their similarity in many traits
of their several characters, the whelp leopard sported
fearlessly round the she-panther. Before Olivier's mid-
night conference with his son, Gabriel had drawn close
and closer to Lucretia, as an ally against his father; for
that father he cherished feelings which, beneath the most
docile obedience, concealed horror and hate, and some-
thing of the ferocity of revenge. And if young Warney
loved any one on earth except himself, it was Lucretia
Clavering. She had administered to his ruling passions,
which were for effect and display; she had devised the
dress which set off to the utmost his exterior, and gave it
that picturesque and artistic appearance which he had

sighed for in his study of the portraits of Titian and Wan-
dyke. She supplied him (for in money she was generous)
with enough to gratify and forestall every boyish caprice,
and this liberality now turned against her, for it had in-
creased into a settled vice his natural taste for extrava-
gance, and made all other considerations subordinate to
that of feeding his cupidity. She praised his drawings,
which, though self-taught, were indeed extraordinary, pre-
dicted his fame as an artist, lifted him into consequence
among the guests by her notice and eulogies; and what,
perhaps, won him more than all, he felt that it was to
her—to Dalibard's desire to conceal before her his more
cruel propensities—that he owed his father's change
from the most refined severity to the most paternal gen-
tleness.
And thus he had repaid her, as she expected, by a de-
votion which she trusted to employ against her tutor him-
self, should the baffled aspirant become the scheming rival
and the secret foe. But now, thoroughly aware of the
gravity of his father's objects, seeing before him the chance
of a settled establishment at Laughton, a positive and in-
fluential connection with Lucretia; and on the other hand,
a return to the poverty he recalled with disgust, and the
terrors of his father's solitary malice and revenge, he en-
tered fully into Dalibard's somber plans, and, without
scruple or remorse, would have abetted any harm to his
benefactress. Thus craft doomed to have accomplices in
craft, resembles the spider whose web, spread indeed for
the fly, attracts the fellow-spider that shall thrust it forth,

and profit by the meshes it has woven for a victim, to sur-
render to a master.
Already young Warney, set quietly and ceaselessly to
spy every movement of Lucretia's, had reported to his
father two visits to the most retired part of the park; but
he had not yet ventured near enough to discover the exact
spot, and his very watch on Lucretia had prevented the
detection of Mainwaring himself in his stealthy exchange
of correspondence. Dalibard bade him continue his watch,
without hinting at his ulterior intentions, for, indeed, in
these he was not decided. Even should he discover any
communication between Lucretia and Mainwaring, how
reveal it to Sir Miles without forever precluding himself
from the chance of profiting by the betrayal? Could Lu-
cretia ever forgive the injury, and could she fail to detect
the hand that inflicted it? His only hope was in the re-
moval of Mainwaring from his path by other agencies than
his own, and (by an appearance of generosity and self-
abandonment, in keeping her secret, and submitting to
his fate) he trusted to regain the confidence she now with-
held from him, and use it to his advantage when the time
came to defend himself from Vernon. For he had learned
from Sir Miles the passive understanding with respect to
that candidate for her hand; and he felt assured that had
Mainwaring never existed, could he cease to exist for her
hopes, Lucretia, despite her dissimulation, would succumb
to one she feared but respected, rather than to one she
evidently trifled with and despised.
“But the course to be taken must be adopted after the

evidence is collected,” thought the subtle schemer, and he
tranquilly continued his chess with the baronet.
Before, however, Gabriel could make any further dis-
coveries, an event occurred which excited very different
emotions among those it more immediately interested.
Sir Miles had, during the last twelve months, been
visited by two seizures, seemingly of an apoplectic char-
acter. Whether they were apoplexy or the less alarming
attacks that arise from some more gentle congestion,
occasioned by free living and indolent habits, was matter
of doubt with his physician—not a very skillful, though a
very formal man. Country doctors were not then the
same able, educated, and scientific class that they are now
rapidly becoming. Sir Miles himself so, stoutly and so
eagerly repudiated the least hint of the more unfavorable
interpretation, that the doctor, if not convinced by his
patient, was awed from expressing plainly a contrary opin-
ion. There are certain persons who will dismiss their
physician if he tells them the truth: Sir Miles was one of
them.
In his character there was a weakness not uncommon to
the proud. He did not fear death, but he shrank from
the thought that others should calculate on his dying. He
was fond of his power, though he exercised it gently: he
knew that the power of wealth and station is enfeebled in
proportion as its dependents can foresee the date of its
transfer. He dreaded, too, the comments which are always
made on those visited by his peculiar disease: “Pool Sir
Miles l an apoplectic fit ! his intellect must be very much

shaken—he revoked at whist last night—memory sadly
impaired ſ” This may be a pitiable foible; but heroes
and statesmen have had it most: pardon it in the proud
old man. He enjoined the physician to state, throughout
the house and the neighborhood, that the attacks were
wholly innocent and unimportant. The physician did so,
and was generally believed; for Sir Miles seemed as lively
and as vigorous after them as before. Two persons alone
were not deceived—Dalibard and Lucretia. The first, at
an earlier part of his life, had studied pathology with the
profound research and ingenious application which he
brought to bear upon all he undertook. He whispered
from the first to Lucretia:
“Unless your uncle changes his habits, takes exer-
cise, and forbears wine and the table, his days are num-
bered.”
And when this intelligence was first conveyed to her,
before she had become acquainted with Mainwaring, Lu-
eretia felt the shock of a grief sudden and sincere. We
have seen how these better sentiments changed as a human
life became an obstacle in her way. In her character, what
phrenologists call “destructiveness,” in the comprehensive
sense of the word, was superlatively developed. She had
not actual cruelty; she was not blood-thirsty: those vices
belong to a different cast of character. She was rather
deliberately and intellectually unsparing—a goal was be-
fore her; she must march to it; all in the way were but
hostile impediments. At first, however, Sir Miles was
not in the way, except to fortune, and for that, as avarice

was not her leading vice, she could well wait; therefore, at
this hint of the Provençal's, she ventured to urge her uncle
to abstinence and exercise; but Sir Miles was touchy on
the subject; he feared the interpretations which great
change of habits might suggest, the memory of the fearful
warning died away, and he felt as well as before, for, save
an old rheumatic gout (which had long since left him, with
no other apparent evil but a lameness in the joints, that
rendered exercise unwelcome and painful), he possessed
one of those comfortable, and often treacherous constitu-
tions, which evince no displeasure at irregularities, and
bear all liberties with philosophical composure. Accord-
ingly, he would have his own way; and he contrived to
coax or to force his doctor into an authority on his side;
wine was necessary to his constitution; much exercise was
a dangerous fatigue. The second attack, following four
months after the first, was less alarming, and Sir Miles
fancied it concealed even from his niece; but three nights
after his recovery, the old baronet sat musing alone for
some time in his own room, before he retired to rest.
Then he rose, opened his desk, and read his will atten-
tively, locked it up with a slight sigh, and took down his
Bible. The next morning he dispatched the letters which
summoned Ardworth and Vernon to his house; and, as he
quitted his room, his look lingered with melancholy fond-
ness upon the portraits in the gallery. No one was by the
old man to interpret these slight signs, in which lay a world
of meaning.
A few weeks after Vernon had left the house, and in

the midst of the restored tranquillity we have described,
it so happened that Sir Miles's physician, after dining at
the hall, had been summoned to attend one of the children
at the neighboring rectory, and there he spent the night.
A little before daybreak his slumbers were disturbed; he
was recalled in all haste to Laughton Hall. For the third
time, he found Sir Miles speechless. Dalibard was by his
bedside. Lucretia had not been made aware of the seizure;
for Sir Miles had previously told his valet (who of late
slept in the same room) never to alarm Miss Clavering if
he was taken ill. The doctor was about to apply his
usual remedies; but when he drew forth his lancet, Dali-
bard placed his hand on the physician's arm:
“Not this time,” he said slowly, and with emphasis;
“it will be his death.”
“Pooh, sir!” said the doctor, disdainfully.
“Do so, then I bleed him, and take the responsibility.
I have studied medicine—I know these symptoms. In
this case the apoplexy may spare—the lancet kills.”
The physician drew back dismayed and doubtful.
“What would you do, then?”
“Wait three minutes longer the effect of the cataplasms
I have applied. If they fail »
“Ay, then f"
“A chill bath, and vigorous friction.”
“Sir, I will never permit it.”

open, his teeth locked. The doctor drew near, looked at
the ſancet, and said irresolutely:
“Your practice is new to me; but if you have studied
medicine, that's another matter. Will you guarantee the
success of your plan 7"
“Yes.”
“Mind, I wash my hands of it; I take Mr. Jones to
witness:” and he appealed to the valet.
“Call up the footmen, and lift your master,” said Dali-
bard; and the doctor, glancing round, saw that a bath,
filled some seven or eight inches deep with water, stood
already prepared in the room. Perplexed and irresolute,
he offered no obstacle to Dalibard's movements. The
body, seemingly lifeless, was placed in the bath; and the
servants, under Dalibard's directions, applied vigorous
and incessant friction. - Several minutes elapsed before
any favorable symptom took place; at length, Sir Miles
heaved a deep sigh, and the eyes moved—a minute or two
more, and the teeth chattered; the blood, set in motion,
appeared on the surface of the skin: life ebbed back; the
danger was past; the dark foe driven from the citadel.
Sir Miles spoke audibly, though incoherently, as he was
taken back to his bed, warmly covered up, the lights re-
moved, noise forbidden, and Dalibard and the doctor
remained in silence by the bedside.
“Rich man,” thought Dalibard, “thine hour is not yet
come; thy wealth must not pass to the boy Mainwaring.”
Sir Miles's recovery, under the care of Dalibard, who
now had his own way, was as rapid and complete as be-

fore. Lucretia, when sº heard, the next morning, of the
attack, felt, we dare not say, a guilty joy, but a terrible
and feverish agitation. Sir Miles himself, informed by
his valet of Dalibard's wrestle with the doctor, felt a pro-
found gratitude and reverent wonder for the simple means
to which he probably owed his restoration; and he listened,
with a docility which Dalibard was not prepared to expect,
to his learned secretary's urgent admonitions as to the life
he must lead, if he desired to live at all. Convinced, at
last, that wine and good cheer had not blockaded out the
enemy, and having to do, in Olivier Dalibard, with a very
different temper from the doctor's, he assented with a
tolerable grace to the trial of a strict regimen and to
daily exercise in the open air. Dalibard now became con-
stantly with him—the increase of his influence was as
natural as it was apparent. Lucretia trembled; she di-
wined a danger in his power, now separate from her own,
and which threatened to be independent of it. She be-
came abstracted and uneasy—jealousy of the Provençal
possessed her. She began to meditate schemes for his
downfall. At this time, Sir Miles received the following
letter from Mr. Fielden :
“SouTHAMPTon, August 20th, 1801.
“DEAR SIR MILES,-You will remember that I informed
you when I arrived at Southampton with my dear young
charge; and Susan has twice written to her sister, implying
the request which she lacked the courage, seeing that she
is timid, expressly to urge, that Miss Clavering might again

be permitted to visit her. Miss Clavering has answered,
as might be expected from the propinquity of the relation-
ship; but she has perhaps the same fears of offending you
that actuate her sister. But now, since the worthy cler-
gyman, who had undertaken my parochial duties, has
found the air insalubrious, and prays me not to enforce
the engagement by which we had exchanged our several
charges for the space of a calendar year, I am reluctantly
compelled to return home—my dear wife, thank Heaven,
being already restored to health, which is an unspeakable
mercy; and I am sure I cannot be sufficiently grateful to
Providence, which has not only provided me with a liberal
independence of more than two hundred pounds a year,
but the best of wives and the most dutiful of children—
possessions that I venture to call ‘the riches of the heart.'
Now, I pray you, my dear Sir Miles, to gratify these two
deserving young persons, and to suffer Miss Lucretia in-
continently to visit her sister. Counting on your consent,
thus boldly demanded, I have already prepared an apart-
ment for Miss Clavering; and Susan is busy in what,
though I do not know much of such feminine matters, the
whole house declares to be a most beautiful and fanciful
toilet cover, with roses and forget-me-nots, cut out of mus-
lin, and two large silk tassels, which cost her three shillings
and fourpence. I cannot conclude, without thanking you
from my heart for your noble kindness to young Ardworth.
He is so full of ardor and spirit, that I remember, poor
lad, when I left him, as I thought, hard at work on that
well-known problem of Euclid, vulgarly called the Asses'

Sir Miles put this letter in his niece's hand, and said,
kindly, “Why not have gone to see your sister before?—I
should not have been angry. Go, my child, as soon as
you like: to-morrow is Sunday—no traveling that day—
but the next, the carriage shall be at your order.”
Lucretia hesitated a moment. To leave Dalibard in
sole possession of the field, even for a few days, was a
thought of alarm; but what evil could he do in that time?

hear — she fancied his last letter had been colder and
shorter—she yearned to hear him say, with his own lips,
that “he loved her still !” This idea banished or prevailed
over all others. She thanked her uncle cheerfully and
gayly, and the journey was settled.
“Be at watch early on Monday,” said Olivier to his
son.
Monday came—the baronet had ordered the carriage to
be at the door at ten. A little before eight, Lucretia stole

out and took her way to Guy's Oak. Gabriel had placed
himself in readiness; he had climbed a tree at the bottom
of the park (near the place where hitherto he had lost
sight of her); she passed under it, on through a dark
grove of pollard oaks. When she was at a sufficient dis-
tance, the boy dropped from his perch; with the stealth
of an Indian he crept on her trace, following from tree to
tree, always sheltered, always watchful; he saw her pause
at the dell and look round—she descended into the hol-
low ; he slunk through the fern—he gained the marge of
the dell, and looked down—she was lost to his sight. At
length, to his surprise, he saw the gleam of her robe
emerge from the hollow of a tree—her head stooped as
she eame through the aperture; he had time to shrink
back among the fern; she passed on hurriedly, the same
way she had taken, back to the house; then into the dell
crept the boy. Guy's Oak, vast and venerable, with gnarled
green boughs below, and sere branches above, that told
that its day of fall was decreed at last—rose high from the
abyss of the hollow—high and far-seen amid the trees that
stood on the vantage-ground above—even as a great name
soars the loftier when it springs from the grave. A dark
and irregular fissure gave entrance to the heart of the oak
—the boy glided in and looked round—he saw nothing—
yet something there must be. The rays of the early sun
did not penetrate into the hollow, it was as dim as a cave.
He felt slowly in every crevice, and a startled moth or two
flew out. It was not for moths that the girl had come to
Guy's Oak! He drew back, at last, in despair; as he did

so, he heard a low sound close at hand, a low murmuring,
angry sound, like a hiss; he looked round, and through
the dark, two burning eyes fixed his own—he had startled
a snake from its bed. He drew out in time, as the reptile
sprang; but now his task, search, and object were for-
gotten. With the versatility of a child, his thoughts were
all on the enemy he had provoked. That zest of prey
which is inherent in man's breast, which makes him love
the sport and the chase, and maddens boyhood and age
with the passion for slaughter, leapt up within him; any.
thing of danger, and contest, and excitement gave Gabriel
Warney a strange fever of pleasure. He sprang up the
sides of the dell, climbed the park pales on which it bor-
dered, was in the wood where the young shoots rose green
and strong from the underwood;—to cut a staff for the
strife, to descend again into the dell, creep again through
the fissure, look round for those vengeful eyes, was quick
done as the joyous play of the impulse. The poor snake
had slid down in content and fancied security; its young,
perhaps, were not far off; its wrath had been the in-
stinct Nature gives to the mother. It hath done thee no
harm yet, boy; leave it in peace | The young hunter had
no ear to such whisper of prudence or mercy. Dim and
blind in the fissure, he struck the ground and the tree with
his stick, shouted out, bade the eyes gleam, and defied
them; whether or not the reptile had spent its ire in the
first fruitless spring, and this unlooked-for return of the
intruder rather daunted than exasperated, we leave those
better versed in natural history to conjecture; but, instead

of obeying the challenge and courting the contest, it glided
by the sides of the oak, close to the very feet of its foe,
and, emerging into the light, dragged its gray coils through
the grass; but its hiss still betrayed it. Gabriel sprang
through the fissure, and struck at the craven, insulting it
with a laugh of scorn as he struck. Suddenly it halted,
suddenly reared its crest; the throat swelled with venom,
the tongue darted out, and again, green as emeralds, glared
the spite of its eyes. No fear felt Gabriel Warney; his
arm was averted; he gazed spelled and admiringly with
the eye of an artist. Had he had pencil and tablet at that
moment, he would have dropped his weapon for the sketch,
though the snake had been as deadly as the viper of Su-
matra. The sight sunk into his memory, to be reproduced
often by the wild, morbid fancies of his hand. Scarce a
moment, however, had he for the gaze; the reptile sprang,
and fell, baffled and bruised by the involuntary blow of its
enemy. As it writhed on the grass, how its colors came
out—how graceful were the movements of its pain l And
still the boy gazed, till the eye was sated and the cruelty
returned. A blow—a second—a third—all the beauty is
gone—shapeless, and clotted with gore, that elegant head;
mangled and dissevered the airy spires of that delicate
shape, which had glanced in its circling involutions, free
and winding as a poet's thought through his verse. The
boy trampled the quivering relics into the sod, with a
fierce animal joy of conquest, and turned once more toward
the hollow, for a last almost hopeless survey. Lo, his
object was found ! In his search for the snake, either his

staff, or his foot, had disturbed a layer of moss in the cor-
ner; the faint ray, ere he entered the hollow, gleamed upon
something white. He emerged from the cavity with a
letter in his hand: he read the address, thrust it into his
bosom, and as stealthily, but more rapidly, than he had
come, took his way to his father.

CHAPTER W.
HOUSEHOLD TREASON.
THE Provençal took the letter from his son's hand, and
looked at him with an approbation half complacent, half
ironical. “Mon fils!” said he, patting the boy's head
gently; “why should we not be friends? We want each
other; we have the strong world to fight against.”
“Not if you are master of this place.”
“Well answered: no; then we shall have the strong
world on our side, and shall have only rogues and the
poor to make war upon.” Then, with a quiet gesture, he
dismissed his son, and gazed slowly on the letter. His
pulse, which was usually low, quickened, and his lips were
tightly compressed; he shrank from the contents with a
jealous pang; as a light quivers strugglingly in a noxious
vault, love, descended into that hideous breast, gleamed
upon dreary horrors, and warred with the noxious atmos-
phere; but it shone still. To this dangerous man every
art that gives power to the household traitor was familiar;
he had no fear that the violated seal should betray the
fraud which gave the contents to the eye that, at length,
steadily fell upon the following lines:
“DEAREST AND EVER DEAREST:—
“Where art thou at this moment? what are thy

of night. I picture you to myself as my hand glides over
the paper. I think I see you, as you look on these words,
and envy them the gaze of those dark eyes. Press your
lips to the paper. Do you feel the kiss that I leave there?
Well, well ! it will not be for long now that we shall be
divided. Oh, what joy, when I think that I am about to
see you ! Two days more, at most three, and we shall
meet—shall we not? I am going to see my sister. I sub-
join my address. Come, come, come; I thirst to see you
once more. And I did well to say, “Wait, and be patient;’
we shall not wait long : before the year is out, I shall be
free. My uncle has had another and more deadly attack.
I see its trace in his face, in his step, in his whole form
and bearing. The only obstacle between us is fading
away. Can I grieve when I think it?—grieve when life
with you spreads smiling beyond the old man's grave?
And why should age, that has survived all passion, stand
with its chilling frown, and the miserable prejudices the
world has not conquered, but strengthened into a creed—
why should age stand between youth and youth 7 I feel

but the pedestal. Oh, how I shall enjoy your revenge
upon the proud l—for I have drawn no pastoral scenes in
my picture of the future. No; I see you leading senates,
and duping fools. I shall be by your side, your partner,

step after step, as you mount the height, for I am ambi-
tious, you know, William; and not less, because I love:
rather ten thousand times more so. I would not have
you born great and noble, for what then could we look
to ? what use all my schemes, and my plans, and aspir-
ings? Fortune, accident would have taken from us the
great zest of life, which is desire.
“When I see you, I shall tell you that I have some
fears of Olivier Dalibard: he has evidently some wily pro-
ject in view. He, who never interfered before with the
blundering physician, now thrusts him aside, affects to
have saved the old man, attends him always. Dares he
think to win an influence to turn against me?—against
us? Happily, when I shall come back, my uncle will
probably be restored to the false strength which deceives
him, he will have less need of Dalibard, and then—then
let the Frenchman beware I have already a plot to turn
his schemes to his own banishment. Come to Southamp-
ton, then, as soon as you can—perhaps the day you re-
ceive this, on Wednesday, at farthest. Your last letter
implies blame of my policy with respect to Vernon. Again
I say, it is necessary to amuse my uncle to the last. Before
Vernon can advance a claim, there will be weeping at
Laughton. I shall weep, too, perhaps; but there will be
joy in those tears, as well as sorrow : for then, when I
clasp thy hand, I can murmur, “It is mine at last, and
forever!" -
“Adieu ! no, not adieu-to our meeting, my love, my
beloved 1–thy LUCRETIA!”

An hour after Miss Clavering had departed on her visit,
Dalibard returned the letter to his son, the seal seemingly
unbroken, and bade him replace it in the hollow of the
tree, but sufficiently in sight to betray itself to the first
that entered. He then communicated the plan he had
formed for its detection—a plan which would prevent Lu-
cretia ever suspecting the agency of his son or himself;
and this done, he joined Sir Miles in the gallery. Hith-
erto, in addition to his other apprehensions in revealing
to the baronet Lucretia's clandestine intimacy with Main-
waring, Dalibard had shrunk from the thought, that the
disclosure would lose her the heritage which had first
tempted his avarice or ambition; but now, his jealous and
his vindictive passions were aroused, and his whole plan of
strategy was changed. He must crush Lucretia, or she
would crush him, as her threats declared. To ruin her in
Sir Miles's eyes, to expel her from his house, might not,
after all, weaken his own position, even with regard to
power over herself. If he remained firmly established at
Laughton, he could affect intercession, he could delay at
least any precipitate union with Mainwaring, by practicing
on the ambition which he still saw at work beneath her love;
he might become a necessary ally, and then,-why then—
his ironical smile glanced across his lips. But beyond this
his quick eye saw fair prospects to self-interest—Lucretia
banished; the heritage not hers; the will to be altered;
Dalibard esteemed indispensable to the life of the baronet!
Come, there was hope here, not for the heritage, indeed,
but at least for a munificent bequest.

At noon, some visitors, bringing strangers from London,
whom Sir Miles had invited to see the house (which was
one of the lions of the neighborhood, though not pro-
fessedly a show place), were expected. Aware of this,
Dalibard prayed the baronet to rest quiet till his company
arrived, and then, he said carelessly,–
“It will be a healthful diversion to your spirits to accom-
pany them a little in the park—you can go in your garden
chair—you will have new companions to talk with by the
way; and it is always warm and sunny at the slope of the
hill, toward the bottom of the park.”
Sir Miles assented cheerfully: the guests came; strolled
over the house, admired the pictures and the armor, and
the hall and the staircase: paid due respect to the sub-
stantial old-fashioned luncheon; and then, refreshed, and
in great good humor, acquiesced in Sir Miles's proposition
to saunter through the park. -
The poor baronet was more lively than usual. The
younger people clustered gayly round his chair (which was
wheeled by his valet), smiling at his jests, and charmed
with his courteous high breeding. A little in the rear
walked Gabriel, paying special attention to the prettiest
and merriest girl of the company, who was a great favorite
with Sir Miles, perhaps for those reasons.
“What a delightful old gentleman " said the young
lady. “How I envy Miss Clavering such an uncle!”
“Ah! but you are a little out of favor to-day,” I can
tell you,” said Gabriel, laughingly; “you were close by
Sir Miles when he went through the picture-gallery, and

you never asked him the history of the old knight in the
buff doublet and blue sash *
“Dear me! what of that?”
“Why, that was brave Colonel Guy St. John, the cava-
lier; the pride and boast of Sir Miles: you know his weak-
ness. He looked so displeased when you said, ‘what a
droll-looking figure P I was on thorns for you!”
“What a pity! I would not offend dear Sir Miles for
the world.”
“Well, it's easy to make it up with him. Go and tell
him that he must take you to see Guy's Oak, in the dell,
that you have heard so much about it; and when you
get him on his hobby, it is hard if you can't make your
peace.”
“Oh! I'll certainly do it, Master Warney;” and the
young lady lost no time in obeying the hint. Gabriel had
set other tongues on the same cry, so that there was a
general exclamation, when the girl named the subject—
“Oh, Guy's Oak, by all means !”
Much pleased with the enthusiasm this memorial of his
pet ancestor produced, Sir Miles led the way to the dell,
and, pausing as he reached the verge, said:
“I fear I cannot do you the honors: it is too steep for
my chair to descend safely.”
Gabriel whispered the fair companion, whose side he still
kept to.
“Now, my dear Sir Miles,” cried the girl, “I positively
won't stir without you; I am sure we could get down the
chair without a jolt. Look there, how nicely the ground

slopes! Jane, Lucy, my dears, let us take charge of Sir
Miles. Now, then.”
The gallant old gentleman would have marched to the
breach in such guidance: he kissed the fair hands that lay
so temptingly on his chair, and then rising with some
difficulty, said:
“No, my dears, you have made me so young again,
that I think I can walk down the steep with the best of
you.”
So, leaning partly on his valet, and by the help of the
hands extended to him, step after step, Sir Miles, with
well-disguised effort, reached the huge roots of the oak.
“The hollow then was much smaller,” said he, “so he
was not so easily detected as a man would be now : the
damned crop-ears—I beg pardon, my dears, the rascally
rebels—poked their swords through the fissure, and two
went, one through his jerkin, one through his arm; but
he took care not to swear at the liberty, and they went
away, not suspecting him.”
While thus speaking, the young people were already
playfully struggling which should first enter the oak. Two
got precedence, and went in and out, one after the other.
Gabriel breathed hard—“The blind owlets!” thought he,
“and I put the letter where a mole would have seen it!”
“You know the spell when you enter an oak-tree where
the fairies have been,” he whispered to the fair object of
his notice. “You must turn round three times, look care-
fully on the ground, and you will see the face you love
best. If I was but a little older, how I should pray ! »

“Nonsense!” said the girl, blushing, as she now said
through the crowd, and went timidly in; presently she
uttered a little exclamation.
The gallant Sir Miles stooped down to see what was
the matter, and offering his hand as she came out, was
startled to see her holding a letter.
“Only think what I have found !” said the girl. “What
a strange place for a post-office I Bless me! it is directed
to Mr. Mainwaring !”
“Mr. Mainwaring !” cried three or four voices; but the
baronet's was mute. His eye recognized Lucretia's hand;
his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth; the blood
surged, like a sea, in his temples; his face became purple.
Suddenly Gabriel, peeping over the girl's shoulder, snatched
away the letter.
“It is my letter—it is mine ! What a shame in Main-
waring not to have come for it as he promised 1"
Sir Miles looked round, and breathed more freely.
“Yours, Master Warney !” said the young lady, aston-
ished. “What can make your letters to Mr. Mainwaring
such a secret?”
“Oh you'll laugh at me; but—but—I wrote e
poem on Guy's Oak, and Mr. Mainwaring promised to get
it into the county paper for me; and as he was to pass
close by the park pales, through the wood yonder, on his

pressure of gratitude. There was a general cry for Ga.

briel to read his poem on the spot; but the boy looked
sheepish, and hung down his head, and seemed rather
more disposed to cry than to recite. Sir Miles, with an
effort at simulation that all his long practice of the world
never could have nerved him to, unexcited by a motive less
strong than the honor of his blood and house, came to the
relief of the young wit that had just come to his own.
“Nay,” he said, almost calmly, “I know our young poet
is too shy to oblige you. I will take charge of your verses,
Master Gabriel;” and, with a grave air of command, he
took the letter from the boy and placed it in his pocket.
The return to the house was less gay than the visit to
the oak. The baronet himself made a feverish effort to
appear blithe and debonnair as before; but it was not
successful. Fortunately, the carriages were all at the door
as they reached the house, and, luncheon being over, no-
thing delayed the parting compliments of the guests. As
the last carriage drove away, Sir Miles beckoned to Gabriel
and bade him follow him into his room.
When there, he dismissed his valet, and said:
“You know, then, who wrote this letter. Have you
been in the secret of the correspondence 7 Speak the
truth, my dear boy, it shall cost you nothing.”
“Oh, Sir Miles 1” cried Gabriel, earnestly, “I know
nothing whatever beyond this—that I saw the hand of my
dear kind Miss Lucretia; that I felt, I hardly knew why,
that both you and she would not have those people dis-
cover it, which they would if the letter had been circulated
from one to the other, for some one would have known the

hand as well as myself, and therefore I spoke, without
thinking, the first thing that came into my head.”
“You—you have obliged me and my niece, sir,” said
the baronet, tremulously; and then, with a forced and
sickly smile, he added—“some foolish vagary of Lucretia's,
I suppose; I must scold her for it. Say nothing about
it, however, to any one.”
“Oh no, sir!”
“Good-by, my dear Gabriel !”
“And that boy saved the honor of my niece's name—
my mother's grandchild! Oh, God! this is bitter!—in my
old age, too !”
He bowed his head over his hands, and tears forced
themselves through his fingers. He was long before he
had courage to read the letter, though he little foreboded
all the shock that it would give him. It was the first
letter, not destined to himself, of which he had ever broken
the seal. Even that recollection made the honorable old
man pause; but his duty was plain and evident, as head of
the house and guardian to his niece. Thrice he wiped his
spectacles; still they were dim, still the tears would come.
He rose tremblingly, walked to the window, and saw the
stately deer grouped in the distance, saw the church spire,
that rose above the burial-vault of his ancestors, and his
heart sunk deeper and deeper, as he muttered—“Wain
pride! pride!” Then he crept to the door and locked it,
and at last, seating himself firmly, as a wounded man to
some terrible operation, he read the letter.

through the bitterest trial which honor and affection can
undergo,-household treason l When the wife lifts high
the blushless front, and brazens out her guilt; when the
child, with loud voice, throws off all control, and makes
boast of disobedience, man revolts at the audacity; his
spirit arms against his wrong; its face, at least, is bare;
the blow, if sacrilegious, is direct. But, when mild words
and soft kisses conceal the worst foe Fate can arm—when
amid the confidence of the heart starts up the form of
Perfidy—when out from the reptile swells the fiend in its
terror—when the breast on which man leaned for comfort
has taken counsel to deceive him—when he learns that,
day after day, the life entwined with his own has been a
lie and a stage-mime, he feels not the softness of grief, nor
the absorption of rage; it is mightier than grief, and more
withering than rage; it is a horror that appalls. The
heart does not bleed; the tears do not flow, as in woes
to which humanity is commonly subjected;—it is as if
something that violates the course of nature had taken
place; something monstrous and out of all thought and
forewarning; for the domestic traitor is a being apart
from the orbit of criminals. The felon has no fear of his
innocent children; with a price on his head, he lays it in
safety on the bosom of his wife. In his home, the ablest
man, the most subtle and suspecting, can be as much a
dupe as the simplest. Were it not so as the rule, and the
exceptions most rare, this world were the riot of a hell!
And therefore it is that to the household perfidy, in all
lands, in all ages, God's curse seems to cleave, and to

God's curse man abandons it: he does not honor it by
hate, still less will he lighten and share the guilt by de-
scending to revenge. He turns aside with a sickness and
loathing, and leaves Nature to purity from the earth the
ghastly phenomenon she abhors.
Old man, that she willfully deceived thee—that she
abused thy belief—and denied to thy question—and pro-
faned maidenhood to stealth—all this might have galled
thee, but to these wrongs old men are subjected;—they
give mirth to Qur farces;–maid and lover are privileged
impostors. But to have counted the sands in thine hour-
glass, to have sate by thy side, marveling when the worms
should have thee—and looked smiling on thy face for the

tioner hungers for the feel
There were no tears in those eyes when they came to
the close—the letter fell noiselessly to the floor; and the
head sank on the breast, and the hands drooped upon the
poor crippled limbs, whose crawl in the sunshine hard
youth had grudged. He felt humbled, stunned—crushed;
the pride was clean gone from him; the cruel words struck
home—worse than a cipher, did he then but cumber the
earth? At that moment, old Ponto, the setter, shook him-
self, looked up, and laid his head in his master's lap; and
Dash, jealous, rose also, and sprang—not actively, for
Dash was old, too—upon his knees, and licked the numbed
drooping hands. Now, people praise the fidelity of dogs
till the theme is worn out, but nobody knows what a dog

that strange wistfulness which, in our hours of trouble, the
eyes of a dog sympathizingly assume—an odd thought for
a sensible man passed into him—showing, mole than pages
of somber elegy, how deep was the sudden misanthropy
that blackened the world around. “When I am dead,”
ran that thought, “is there one human being whom I can
trust to take charge of the old man's dogs?”

The -WILL.
THE next day, or rather the next evening, Sir Miles St.
John was seated before his unshared chicken; seated alone,
and vaguely surprised at himself, in a large comfortable
room in his old hotel, Hanover Square; —yes, he had
escaped. Hast thou, O reader, tasted the luxury of escape
from a home where the charm is broken—where Distrust
looks askant from the Lares? In vain had Dalibard re-
monstrated, conjured up dangers, and asked at least to
accompany him. Excepting his dogs and his old valet,
who was too like a dog in his fond fidelity to rank among
bipeds, Sir Miles did not wish to have about him a single
face, familiar at Laughton,--Dalibard especially. Lu-
cretia's letter had hinted at plans and designs in Dalibard.
It might be unjust, it might be ungrateful, but he grew
sick at the thought that he was the center stone of strata-
gems and plots. The smooth face of the Provençal took
a wily expression in his eyes; nay, he thought his very
footmen watched his steps as if to count how long before
they followed his bier I So, breaking from all roughly
with a shake of his head, and a laconic assertion of busi-
ness in London, he got into his carriage—his own old
bachelor's lumbering traveling carriage—and bade the

post-boys drive fast, fast. Then, when he felt alone—
quite alone—and the gates of the lodge swung behind him,
he rubbed his hands with a schoolboy's glee, and chuckled
loud, as if he enjoyed not only the sense but the fun of his
safety—as if he had done something prodigiously cunning
and clever. -
So when he saw himself snug in his old well-remembered
hotel, in the same room as of yore—when returned, brisk
and gay, from the breezes of Weymouth, or the brouil-
lards of Paris, he thought he shook hands again with his
youth. Age and lameness, apoplexy and treason, all were
forgotten for the moment. And when, as the excitement
died, those grim specters came back again to his thoughts,
they found their victim braced and prepared, standing
erect on that hearth, for whose hospitality he paid his
guinea a day—his front, proud and defying. He felt yet
that he had fortune and power, that a movement of his
hand could raise and strike down, that, at the verge of the
tomb, he was armed, to punish or reward, with the balance
and the sword. Tripped in the smug waiter, and an-
nounced “Mr. Parchmount.”
“Set a chair, and show him in.”
The lawyer entered.
“My dear Sir Miles, this is indeed a surprise. What

“The common whim of the old, sir. I would alter my
Will.” -
Three days did lawyer and client devote to the task, for
Sir Miles was minute, and Mr. Parchmount was precise;

and little difficulties arose, and changes in the first outline
were made; and Sir Miles, from the very depth of his dis-
gust, desired not to act only from passion. In that last
deed of his life the old man was sublime. He sought to
rise out of the mortal, fix his eyes on the Great Judge,
weigh circumstances and excuses, and keep justice even
and serene.
Meanwhile, unconscious of the train laid afar, Lucretia
reposed on the mine—reposed, indeed, is not the word,
for she was agitated and restless that Mainwaring had
not obeyed her summons. She wrote to him again from
Southampton the third day of her arrival; but before his
answer came, she received this short epistle from London:
“Mr. Parchmount presents his compliments to Miss
Clavering, and, by desire of Sir Miles St. John, requests
her not to return to Laughton. Miss Clavering will hear
further in a few days, when Sir Miles has concluded the
business that has brought him to London.”
This letter, if it excited much curiosity, did not produce
alarm. It was natural that Sir Miles should be busy in
winding up his affairs: his journey to London for that pur-
pose was no ill omen to her prospects, and her thoughts
flew back to the one subject that tyrannized over them.
Mainwaring's reply, which came two days afterward, dis-
quieted her much more. He had not found the letter she
had left for him in the tree. He was full of apprehensions;
he condemned the imprudence of calling on her at Mr.
Fielden's; he begged her to renounce the idea of such a
risk. He would return again to Guy's Oak, and search

more narrowly—had she changed the spot where the
former letters were placed? Yet now, not even the non-
receipt of her letter, which she ascribed to the care with
which she had concealed it amid the dry leaves and moss,
disturbed her so much as the evident constraint with which
Mainwaring wrote—the cautious and lukewarm remon-
strance which answered her passionate appeal. It may be,
that her very doubts, at times, of Mainwaring's affection
had increased the ardor of her own attachment; for in
some natures the excitement of fear deepens love more
than the calmness of trust. Now with the doubt for the
first time flashed the resentment, and her answer to Main-
waring was vehement and imperious. But the next day
came a messenger express from London, with a letter from
Mr. Parchmount, that arrested for the moment even the
fierce current of love.
When the task had been completed—the will signed,
sealed, and delivered—the old man had felt a load lifted
from his heart. Three or four of his old friends, bons
vivans like himself, had seen his arrival duly proclaimed
in the newspapers, and had hastened to welcome him.
Warmed by the genial sight of faces associated with the
frank joys of his youth, Sir Miles, if he did not forget the
prudent counsels of Dalibard, conceived a proud bitterness
of joy in despising them. Why take such care of the
worn-out carcass? His will was made. What was left
to life so peculiarly attractive? He invited his friends to
a feast worthy of old : seasoned revelers were they, with a
free gout for a vent to all indulgence. So they came; and

they drank, and they laughed, and they talked back their
young days: they saw not the nervous irritation, the strain
on the spirits, the heated membrane of the brain, which
made Sir Miles the most jovial of all. It was a night of
nights—the old fellows were lifted back into their chariots
or sedans. Sir Miles alone seemed as steady and sober as
if he had supped with Diogenes. His servant, whose re-
spectful admonitions had been awed into silence, lent him
his arm to bed, but Sir Miles scarcely touched it. The .
next morning, when the servant (who slept in the same
room) awoke, to his surprise the glare of a candle streamed
on his eyes; he rubbed them : could he see right?—Sir
Miles was seated at the table—he must have got up and
lighted a candle to write—noiselessly, indeed. The servant
looked and looked, and the stillness of Sir Miles awed
him: he was seated on an arm-chair, leaning back. As
awe succeeded to suspicion, he sprang up, approached his
master, took his hand : it was cold, and fell heavily from
his clasp—Sir Miles must have been dead for hours.
The pen lay on the ground, where it had dropped from
the hand; the letter on the table was scarcely commenced;
the words ran thus:
“LUCRETIA-You will return no more to my house
You are free as if I were dead; but I shall be just. Would
that I had been so to your mother—to your sister! But I
am old now, as you say, and 77

unwritten would have been clear. There was, first, the
sharp struggle to conquer loathing repugnance, and ad-
dress at all the false and degraded one; then came the
sharp sting of ingratitude—then the idea of the life
grudged, and the grave desired—then the stout victory
over scorn—the resolution to be just—then the reproach
of the conscience, that for so far less an offense the sister
had been thrown aside—the comfort, perhaps, found in her
gentle and neglected child, obstinately repelled—then the
conviction of all earthly vanity and nothingness—the look
on into life, with the chilling sentiment that affection was
gone—that he could never trust again—that he was too
old to open his arms to new ties; and then, before felt
singly, all these thoughts united, and snapped the cord l
In announcing his mournful intelligence, with more feel-
ing than might have been expected from a lawyer (but
even his lawyer loved Sir Miles), Mr. Parchmount observed,
“that as the deceased lay at an hotel, and as Miss Claver-
ing's presence would not be needed in the performance of
the last rites, she would probably forbear the journey to
town. Nevertheless, as it was Sir Miles's wish that the
will should be opened as soon as possible after his death,
and it would, doubtless, contain instructions as to his
funeral, it would be well that Miss Clavering and her sister
should immediately depute some one to attend the reading
of the testament, on their behalf. Perhaps Mr. Fielden
would kindly undertake that melancholy office.”
To do justice to Lucretia, it must be said that her first
emotions, on the receipt of this letter, were those of a

poignant and remorseful grief, for which she was unpre-
pared. But how different it is to count on what shall
follow death, and to know that death has come ! Susan's
sobbing sympathy availed not, nor Mr. Fielden's pious and
tearful exhortations; her own sinful thoughts and hopes
came back to her, haunting and stern as furies. She in-
sisted at first upon going to London—gazing once more
on the clay: nay, the carriage was at the door, for all
yielded to her vehemence; but then her heart misgave her:
she did not dare to face the dead l Conscience waved
her back from the solemn offices of nature; she hid her
face with her hands, shrunk again into her room; and
Mr. Fielden, assuming unbidden the responsibility, went
alone.
Only Welmon (summoned from Brighton), the good
clergyman, and the lawyer, to whom, as sole executor,
the will was addressed, and in whose custody it had been
left, were present when the seal of the testament was
broken. The will was long, as is common when the dust
that it disposes of covers some fourteen or fifteen thousand
acres. But out of the mass of technicalities and repeti
tions these points of interest rose salient, -To Charles
Vernon, of Wernon Grange, Esq., and his heirs by him
lawfully begotten, were left all the lands and woods and
manors that covered that space, in the Hampshire map,
known by the name of the “Laughton property,” on con-
dition that he and his heirs assumed the name and arms
of St John; and on the failure of Mr. Vernon's issue, the
2state passed, first (with the same conditions) to the issue

of Susan Mivers; next, to that of Lucretia Clavering.
There the entail ceased—and the contingency fell to the
rival ingenuity of lawyers in hunting out, among the re-
mote and forgotten descendants of some ancient St. John,
the heir-at-law. To Lucretia Clavering, without a word
of endearment, was bequeathed 10,000l., the usual portion
which the house of St. John had allotted to its daughters;
to Susan Mivers the same sum, but with the addition of
these words, withheld from her sister—“and my blessing!”
To Olivier Dalibard, an annuity of 200l. a year; to Honoré
Gabriel Warney, 3000l.; to the Rev. Matthew Fielden,
4000l.; and the same sum to John Walter Ardworth. To
his favorite servant, Henry Jones, an ample provision, and
the charge of his dogs Dash and Ponto, with an allowance
therefor, to be paid weekly, and cease at their deaths.
Poor old man l he made it the interest of their guardian
not to grudge their lees of life. To his other attendants,
suitable and munificent bequests, proportioned to the length
of their services. For his body, he desired it buried in the
vault of his ancestors without pomp, but without a pre-
tense to a humility which he had not manifested in life;
and he requested that a small miniature in his writing-
desk should be placed in his coffin. That last injunction
was more than a sentiment, it bespoke the moral convic-
tion of the happiness the original might have conferred on
his life, of that happiness his pride had deprived him;
nor did he repent, for he had deemed pride a duty; but
the mute likeness, buried in his grave—that told the might
of the sacrifice he had made l Death removes all distiuc-

tions, and in the coffin the Lord of Laughton might choose
his partner.
When the will had been read, Mr. Parchmount pro-
duced two letters, one addressed in the hand of the de-
ceased to Mr. Vernon, the other in the lawyer's own hand
to Miss Clavering. The last inclosed the fragment found
on Sir Miles's table, and her own letter to Mainwaring,
redirected to her in Sir Miles's boldest and stateliest auto-
graph. He had, no doubt, meant to return it in the letter
left uncompleted.
The letter to Vernon contained a copy of Lucretia's
fatal epistle, and the following lines to Vernon himself:
“MY DEAR CHARLEs, – With much deliberation, and
with natural reluctance to reveal to you my niece's shame,
I feel it my duty to transmit to you the accompanying in-
closure, copied from the original with my own hand, which
the task sullied. I do so, first, because otherwise you
might, as I should have done in your place, feel bound in
honor to persist in the offer of your hand—feel bound the
more, because Miss Clavering is not my heiress; secondly,
because had her attachment been stronger than her interest,
and she had refused your offer, you might still have deemed
her hardly and capriciously dealt with by me, and not only
sought to augment her portion, but have profaned the
house of my ancestors by receiving her there as an honored
and welcomed relative and guest. Now, Charles Vernon,
I believe, to the utmost of my poor judgment, I have done
what is right and just. I have taken into consideration

that this young person has been brought up as a daughter
of my house, and what the daughters of my house have
received, I bequeath her; I put aside, as far as I can, all
resentment of mere family pride; I show that I do so,
when I repair my harshness to my poor sister, and leave
both her children the same provision. And if you exceed
what I have done for Lucretia, unless, on more dispassion-
ate consideration than I can give, you conscientiously
think me wrong, you insult my memory and impugn my
justice; be it in this as your conscience dictates; but I
entreat, I adjure, I command at least, that you never
knowingly admit by a hearth, hitherto sacred to unblem-
ished truth and honor, a person who has desecrated it with
treason. As gentleman to gentleman, I impose on you
this solemn injunction. I could have wished to leave that
young woman's children barred from the entail; but our
old tree has so few branches! You are unwedded; Susan,
too. I must take my chance that Miss Clavering's chil-
dren, if ever they inherit, do not imitate the mother. I
conclude she will wed that Mainwaring; her children will
have a low-born father. Well, her race, at least, is pure.
Clavering and St. John are names to guarantee faith and
honor; yet you see what she is 1–Charles Vernon, if her
issue inherit the soul of gentlemen, it must come, after all,
not from the well-born mother! I have lived to say this;
I, who—but perhaps if we had looked more closely into
the pedigree of those Claverings'

its old fame. Be kind and good to my poor—don't strain
on the tenants. By-the-way, Farmer Strongbow owes
three years' rent—I forgive him—pension him off—he can
do no good to the land, but he was born on it, and must
not fall on the parish. But to be kind and good to the
poor, not to strain on the tenants, you must learn not to
waste, my dear Charles. A needy man can never be gen-
erous without being unjust. How give, if you are in debt?
You will think of this—now—now—while your good heart
is soft—while your feelings are moved. Charley Vernon, I
think you will shed a tear when you see my arm-chair still
and empty. And I would have left you the care of my
dogs, but you are thoughtless, and will go much to Lon-
don, and they are used to the country now. Old Jones
will have a cottage in the village; he has promised to live
there; drop in now and then, and see poor Ponto and
Dash. It is late, and old friends come to dine here. So,
if anything happens to me, and we don't meet again, good-
by, and God bless you !

CHAPTE R W II.
The ENGAGEMENT.
IT is somewhat less than three months after the death of
Sir Miles St. John–November reigns in London. And
“reigns” seems scarcely a metaphysical expression as ap-
plied to the sullen, absolute sway which that dreary month
—(first in the dynasty of Winter)—spreads over the pas-
sive dejected city. Elsewhere, in England, November is
no such gloomy grim fellow as he is described. Over the
brown glebes and changed woods in the country his still
face looks contemplative and mild, and he has soft smiles,
too, at times—lighting up his taxed vassals the groves—
gleaming where the leaves still cling to the boughs—and
reflected in dimples from the waves which still glide free
from his chains. But as a conqueror, who makes his home
in the capital, weighs down with hard policy the mutinous
citizens, long ere his iron influence is felt in the province,
so the first tyrant of Winter has only rigor and frowns for
London. The very aspect of the wayfarers has the look
of men newly enslaved; cloaked and muffled, they steal to
and fro through the dismal fogs. Even the children creep
timidly through the streets; the carriages go cautious and
hearse-like along; daylight is dim and obscure; the town
is not filled, nor the brisk mirth of Christmas commenced;

the unsocial shadows flit amid the mist, like men on the
eve of a fatal conspiracy. Each other month in London
has its charms for the experienced. Even from August to
October, when The Season lies dormant, and Fashion for-
bids her sons to be seen within hearing of Bow, the true
lover of London finds pleasure still at hand if he search
for her duly;-the early walks through the parks and green
Kensington Gardens, which now change their character of
resort, and seem rural and countrylike, but yet with more
life than the country; for on the benches beneath the trees,
and along the sward and up the malls, are living beings
enough to interest the eye and divert the thoughts, if you
are a guesser into character, and amateur of the human
face; fresh nursery-maid and playful children, and the old
shabby-genteel buttoned-up officer, musing on half-pay, as
he sits alone in some alcove of Kenna, or leans pensive
over the rail of the vacant Ring; and early tradesman, or
clerk from the suburban lodging, trudging brisk to his
business, for business never ceases in London; then at
noon, what delight to escape to the banks at Putney or
Richmond—the row up the river—the fishing-punt—the
ease at your inn till dark l—or, if this tempt not, still,
Autumn shines clear and calm over the roofs, where the
smoke has a holiday; and how clean gleam the vistas
through the tranquilized thoroughfares, and as you saun-
ter along you have all London to yourself, Alexander Sel-
kirk. but with the mart of the world for your desert!
And when October comes on, it has one characteristic of
spring,-life busily returns to the city; you see the shops

bustling up, trade flowing back; as birds scent the April,
so the children of commerce plume their wings and pre-
pare for the first slack returns of the season. But No-
vember 1–strange the taste, stout the lungs, grief defying
the heart of the visitor who finds charms and joy in a
London November.
In a small lodging-house in Bulstrode Street, Manches-
ter Square, grouped a family in mourning, who had had
the temerity to come to town in November, for the pur-
pose, no doubt, of raising their spirits. In the dull small
drawing-room of the dull small house we introduce to you,
first, a middle-aged gentleman, whose dress showed, what
dress now fails to show—his profession; nobody could mis-
take the cut of the cloth, and the shape of the hat, for he
had just come in from a walk, and not from discourtesy,
but abstraction, the broad brim still shadowed his pleasant
placid face. Parson spoke out in him, from beaver to
buckle. By the coal fire, where, through volumes of smoke,
fussed and flickered a pretension to flame, sate a middle-
aged lady, whom, without being a conjuror, you would
pronounce at once to be wife to the parson; and sundry
children sate on stools all about her, with one book be-
tween them, and a low whispered murmur from their two
or three pursed-up lips, announcing that that book was
superfluous. By the last of three dim-looking windows,
made dimmer by brown moreen draperies, edged genteely
with black cotton velvet, stood a girl of very soft and pen-
sive expression of features—pretty, unquestionably—ex-
cessively pretty—but there was something so delicate and

elegant about her—the bend of her head, the shape of her
slight figure, the little fair hands crossed one on each other,
as the face mournfully and listlessly turned to the window,
—that “pretty” would have seemed a word of praise, too
often proffered to milliner and serving-maid; nevertheless,
it was perhaps the right one;—handsome would have im-
plied something statelier and more commanding—beau-
tiful, greater regularity of feature, or richness of coloring.
The parson, who, since his entrance, had been walking up
and down the small room, with his hands behind him,
glancing now and then at the young lady, but not speak-
ing, at length paused from that monotonous exercise, by
the chair of his wife, and touched her shoulder. She
stopped from her work, which, more engrossing than ele-
gant, was nothing less than what is technically called “the
taking in" of a certain blue jacket, which was about to
pass from Matthew, the eldest born, to David, the second,
and looked up at her husband affectionately; her husband,
however, spoke not,-he only made a sign, partly with his
eyebrow, partly with a jerk of his thumb over his right
shoulder, in the direction of the young lady we have de-
scribed, and then completed the pantomime with a melan-
choly shake of the head. The wife turned round and
looked hard, the scissors horizontally raised in one hand,
while the other reposed on the cuff of the jacket. At
this moment a low knock was heard at the street door.
The worthy pair saw the girl shrink back, with a kind of
tremulous movement; presently there came the sannd of a

footstep below—the creak of a hinge on the ground floor
—and again *ll was silent.
“That is Mr. Mainwaring's knock,” said one of the
children. -
The girl left the room abruptly, and, light as was her
step, they heard her steal up the stairs.
“My dears,” said the parson, “it wants an hour yet to
dark, you may go and walk in the square.”
“'Tis so dull in that ugly square, and they won't let us
into the green. I am sure we'd rather stay here,” said
one of the children, as spokesman for the rest, and they all
nestled closer round the hearth.
“But, my dears,” said the parson, simply, “I want to
talk alone with your mother. However, if you like best
to go and keep quiet in your own room, you may do so.”
“Or we can go into Susan's?”
“No,” said the parson; “you must not disturb Susan.”
“She never used to care about being disturbed. I
wonder what's come to her ?”
The parson made no rejoinder to this half-petulant ques-
tion. The children consulted together a moment, and re-
solved that the square, though so dull, was less dull than
their own little attic. That being decided, it was the
mother's turn to address them. And though Mr. Fielden
was as anxious and fond as most father's, he grew a little
impatient before comforters, kerchiefs, and muffatees were
arranged, and minute exordiums as to the danger of cross-
ing the street, and the risk of patting strange dogs, etc.,
were half-way concluded;—with a shrug and a smile, he

at length fairly pushed out the children, shut the door, and
drew his chair close to his wife's. s
“My dear,” he began at once, “I am extremely uneasy
about that poor girl.”
“What! Miss Clavering 7 Indeed, she eats almost no-
thing at all, and sits so moping alone; but she sees Mr.
Mainwaring every day. What can we do? She is so
proud, I'm afraid of her.”
“My dear, I was not thinking of Miss Clavering, though
I did not interrupt you, for it is very true that she is much
to be pitied.”
“And I am sure it was for her sake alone that you
agreed to Susan's request, and got Blackman to do duty
for you at the vicarage, while we all came up here, in
hopes London town would divert her. We left all at sixes
and sevens; and I should not at all wonder if John made
away with the apples.”
“But, I say,” resumed the parson, without heeding that
mournful foreboding—“I say, I was then only thinking of
Susan. You see how pale and sad she is grown.”
“Why, she is so very soft-hearted, and she must feel for
her sister.”
“But her sister, though she thinks much, and keeps
aloof from us, is not sad herself; only reserved. On the
eontrary, I believe she has now got over even poor Sir
Miles's death.”
“And the loss of the great property!”
“Fie, Mary 1” said Mr. Fielden, almost austerely.
Mary looked down, rebuked, for she was not one of the

high-spirited wives who despise their husbands for good-
ness.
“I beg pardon, my dear,” she said, meekly; “it was
very wrong in me; but I cannot—do what I will—I can-
not like that Miss Clavering.”
“The more need to judge her with charity. And if
what I fear is the case, I'm sure we can't feel too much
compassion for the poor blinded young lady.”
“Bless my heart, Mr. Fielden, what is it you mean?”
The parson looked round to be sure the door was quite
closed, and replied, in a whisper—“I mean, that I fear
William Mainwaring loves not Lucretia, but Susan.”
The scissors fell from the hand of Mrs. Fielden; and
though one point stuck in the ground, and the other point
threatened war upon flounces and toes, strange to say, she
did not even stoop to remove the chevaux de frise.
“Why, then, he's a most false-hearted young man 1"
“To blame, certainly,” said Fielden; “I don't say to
the contrary, though I like the young man, and am sure
that he's more timid than false. I may now tell you—for
I want your advice, Mary—what I kept secret before.
When Mainwaring visited us, many months ago, at South-
ampton, he confessed to me that he felt warmly for Susan,
and asked if I thought Sir Miles would consent. I knew
too well how proud the poor old gentleman was to give
him any such hopes. So he left very honorably. You
remember, after he went, that Susan's spirits were low—
you remarked it.”
“Yes, indeed, I remember. But when the first shock

of Sir Miles's death was over, she got back her swee:
color and looked cheerful enough.”
“Because, perhaps, then she felt that she had a fortune
to bestow on Mr. Mainwaring, and thought all obstacle
was over.”
“Why, how clever you are l How did you get at her
thoughts?”
“My own folly—my own rash folly,” almost groaned
Mr. Fielden. “For, not guessing that Mr. Mainwaring
could have got engaged meanwhile to Lucretia, and sus-
pecting how it was with Susan's poor little heart, I let
out, in a jest—Heaven forgive me !—what William had
said; and the dear child blushed, and kissed me, and—
why, a day or two after, when it was fixed that we should
come up to London, Lucretia informed me, with her freez-
ing politeness, that she was to marry Mainwaring herself,
as soon as her first mourning was over.”
“Poor, dear—dear Susan 1"
“Susan behaved like an angel; and when I broached it
to her, I thought she was calm; and I am sare she prayed
with her whole heart that both might be happy.”
“I’m sure she did. What is to be done 7 I understand
it all now. Dear me, dear me !—a sad piece of work,
inieed.” And Mrs. Fielden abstractedly picked up the
scissors.
“It was not till our coming to town, and Mr. Mainwar-
ing's visits to Lucretia, that her strength gave way.”
“A hard sight to bear: I never could have borne it, my
love. If I had seen you paying court to another, I should

have—I don't know what I should have done ! But what
an artful wretch this young Mainwaring must bel"
“Not very artful; for you see that he looks even sadder
than Susan. He got entangled somehow, to be sure.
Perhaps he had given up Susan in despair; and Miss
Clavering, if haughty, is no doubt a very superior young
lady; and, I dare say, it is only now in seeing them both
together, and comparing the two, that he feels what a
treasure he has lost. Well, what do you advise, Mary 7
Mainwaring, no doubt, is bound in honor to Miss Claver-
ing; but she will be sure to discover, sooner or later, the
state of his feelings, and then I tremble for both. I'm
sure she will never be happy, while he will be wretched;
and Susan—I dare not think upon Susan —she has a
cough that goes to my heart.”
“So she has; that cough—you don't know the money I
spend on black-currant jelly l What's my advice? why,
I’d speak to Miss Clavering at once, if I dared. I'm sure
love never will break her heart; and she's so proud, she'd
throw him of without a sigh, if she knew how things
stood.”
“I believe you are right,” said Mr. Fielden; “for truth
is the best policy after all. Still, it's scarce my business
to meddle; and if it were not for Susan—well, well, I
must think of it, and pray Heaven to direct me.”
This conference suffices to explain to the reader the
stage to which the history of Lucretia had arrived. Will-
ingly we pass over what it were scarcely possible to de-
scribe—her first shock at the fall from the expectations of

her life;—fortune, rank, and what she valued more than
either, power—crushed at a blow. From the dark and
sullen despair into which she was first plunged, she was
roused into hope—into something like joy—by Mainwar-
ing's letters. Never had they been so warm and so tender;
for the young man felt not only poignant remorse that he
had been the cause of her downfall (though she broke it to
him with more delicacy than might have been expected
from the state of her feelings and the hardness of her char-
acter), but he felt also imperiously the obligations which
her loss rendered more binding than ever. He persuaded,
he urged, he forced himself into affection; and, probably,
without a murmur of his heart, he would have gone with
her to the altar, and, once wedded, custom and duty would
have strengthened the chain imposed on himself, had it
not been for Lucretia's fatal eagerness to see him, to come
up to London, where she induced him to meet her—for
with her came Susan; and in Susan's averted face, and
trembling hand, and mute avoidance of his eye, he read
all which the poor dissembler fancied she concealed. But
the die was cast, the union announced, the time fixed, and
day by day he came to the house, to leave it in anguish
and despair. A feeling they shared in common caused
these two unhappy persons to shun each other. Main-
waring rarely came into the usual sitting-room of the
family; and when he did so, chiefly in the evening, Susan
usually took refuge in her own room. If they met, it was
by accident, on the stairs, or at the sudden opening of a
door; then not only no word, but scarcely even a look

was exchanged; neither had the courage to face the other.
Perhaps, of the two, this reserve weighed most on Susan;
perhaps she most yearned to break the silence, for she
thought she divined the cause of Mainwaring's gloomy
and mute &onstraint, in the upbraidings of his conscience,
which might doubtless recall—if no positive pledge to
Susan—at least, those words and tones which betray the
one heart and seek to allure the other; and the profound
melancholy stamped on his whole person, apparent even to
her hurried glance, touched her with a compassion free
from all the bitterness of selfish reproach. She fancied
she could die happy if she could remove that cloud from
his brow, that shadow from his conscience. Die—for she
thought not of life. She loved gently, quietly; not with
the vehement passion that belongs to stronger natures;
but it was the love of which the young and the pure have
died. The face of the Genius was calm and soft; and
only by the lowering of the hand do you see that the
torch burns out, and that the image too serene for earthly
love is the genius of loving Death.
Absorbed in the egotism of her passion—increased, as
is ever the case with women, even the worst, by the sacri.
fices it had cost her—and if that passion paused, by the
energy of her ambition, which already began to scheme
and reconstruct new scaffolds to repair the ruined walls of
the past, Lucretia as yet had not detected what was so
apparent to the simple sense of Mr. Fielden. That Main-
waring was grave, and thoughtful, and abstracted, she
ascribed only to his grief at the thought of her loss, and

his anxieties for her altered future; and in her efforts to
console him, her attempts to convince him that greauness
in England did not consist only in lands and manors—
that in the higher walks of life which conduct to the Tem-
ple of Renown, the leaders of the procession are the aris-
tocracy of knowledge and of intellect—she so betrayed,
not generous emulation and high-souled aspiring, but the
dark, unscrupulous, tortuous ambition of cunning, strat-
agem, and intrigue, that instead of feeling grateful and
encouraged, he shuddered and revolted. How, accom-
panied and led by a spirit which he felt to be stronger and
more commanding than his own—how preserve the white-
ness of his soul, the uprightness of his honor 7 Already
he felt himself debased. But in the still trial of domestic
intercourse, with the daily, hourly dripping on the stone,
in the many struggles between truth and falsehood, guile
and candor, which men—and, above all, ambitious men—
must wage, what darker angel would whisper him in his
monitor 7 Still he was bound–bound with an iron band;
he writhed, but dreamed not of escape.
The day after that of Fielden's conference with his wife,
an unexpected visitor came to the house. Olivier Dali-
bard called. He had not seen Lucretia since she had left
Laughton, nor had any correspondence passed between
them. He came at dusk, just after Mainwaring's daily
visit was over, and Lucretia was still in the parlor which
she had appropriated to herself. Her brow contracted as
ais name was announced, and the maid-servant lighted the

candle on the table, stirred the fire, and gave a tug at the
curtains. Her eye, glancing from his round the mean
room, with its dingy, horsehair furniture, involuntarily
implied the contrast between the past state and the pres-
ent, which his sight could scarcely help to impress on her.
But she welcomed him with her usual stately composure,
and without reference to what had been. Dalibard was
secretly anxious to discover if she suspected himself of
any agency in the detection of the eventful letter, and,
assured by her manner that no such thought was yet har-
bored, he thought it best to imitate her own reserve. He
assumed, however, a manner that, far more respectful than
he ever before observed to his pupil, was nevertheless suffi-
ciently kind and familiar to restore them gradually to their
old footing; and that he succeeded was apparent, when,
after a pause, Lucretia said abruptly: “How did Sir
Miles St. John discover my correspondence with Mr. Main-
waring 7”
“Is it possible that you are ignorant? Ah, how—how
should you know it?” And Dalibard so simply explained
the occurrence, in which, indeed, it was impossible to trace
the hand that had moved springs which seemed so entirely
set at work by an accident, that despite the extreme sus-
piciousness of her nature, Lucretia did not see a pretense
for accusing him. Indeed, when he related the little sub-
terfuge of Gabriel, his attempt to save her by taking the
letter on himself, she felt thankful to the boy, and deemed
Gabriel's conduct quite in keeping with his attachment to
herself And this accounted satisfactorily for the only

circumstance that had ever troubled her with a doubt—
viz., the legacy left to Gabriel. She knew enough of Sir
Miles to be aware that he would be grateful to any one
who had saved the name of his niece, even while most
embittered against her, from the shame attached to clan-
destine correspondence.
“It is strange, nevertheless,” said she, thoughtfully,
after a pause, “that the girl should have detected the let-
ter, concealed, as it was, by the leaves that covered it.”
“But,” answered Dalibard, readily, “you see two or
three persons had entered before, and their feet must have
displaced the leaves.” -
“Possibly; the evil is now past recall.”
“And Mr. Mainwaring 7 do you still adhere to one who
has cost you so much, poor child?”
“In three months more I shall be his wife.”
Dalibard sighed deeply, but offered no remonstrance.
“Well,” he said, taking her hand with mingled rever-
ence and affection—“well, I oppose your inclinations no
more, for now there is nothing to risk, you are mistress of
your own fortune; and since Mainwaring has talents, that
fortune will suffice for a career. Are you at length con-
vinced that I have conquered my folly? that I was dis-
interested when I incurred your displeasure ? If so, can
you restore to me your friendship? You will have some
struggle with the world, and, with my long experience of
men and life, even I, the poor exile, may assist you.”
And so thought Lucretia; for with some dread of Dali-
bard's craft, she yet credited his attachment to herself, and

she felt profound admiration for an intelligence more con-
summate and accomplished than any ever yet submitted to
her comprehension. From that time, Dalibard became an
habitual visitor at the house; he never interfered with Lu-
cretia's interviews with Mainwaring ; he took the union
for granted, and conversed with her cheerfully on the pros-
pects before her; he ingratiated himself with the Fieldens,
played with the children, made himself at home, and in the
evenings when Mainwaring, as often as he could find the
excuse, absented himself from the family circle, he contrived
to draw Lucretia into more social intercourse with her
homely companions than she had before condescended to
admit. Good Mr. Fielden rejoiced: here was the very
person, the old friend of Sir Miles, the preceptor of Lu-
cretia herself, evidently most attached to her, having in-
fluence over her—the very person to whom to confide his
embarrassment. One day, therefore, when Dalibard had
touched his heart by noticing the paleness of Susan, he
took him aside and told him all. “And now,” concluded
the pastor, hoping he had found one to relieve him of his
dreaded and ungracious task, “don’t you think that I–or
rather you—as so old a friend, should speak frankly to
Miss Clavering herself.”
“No, indeed,” said the Provencal, quickly; “if we spoke
to her she would disbelieve us. She would no doubt ap-
peal to Mainwaring, and Mainwaring would have no choice
but to contradict us. Once put on his guard, he would
control his very sadness. Lucretia, offended, might leave
your house, and certainly she would regard her sister as

having influenced your confession—a position unworthy
Miss Mivers. But do not fear; if the evil be so, it carries
with it its inevitable remedy. Let Lucretia discover it
herself; but, pardon me, she must have seen, at your first
reception of Mainwaring, that he had before been ac-
quainted with you?”
“She was not in the room when we first received Main-
waring, and I have always been distant to him, as you
may suppose, for I felt disappointed and displeased. Of
course, however, she is aware that we knew him before
she did. What of that?”
“Why, do you think then he told her at Laughton of
this acquaintance 7–that he spoke of Susan 7–I suspect
not.”
“I cannot say, I am sure,” said Mr. Fielden.
“Ask her that question accidentally, and for the rest be
discreet, my dear sir. I thank you for your confidence. I
will watch well over my poor young pupil. She must not,
indeed, be sacrificed to a man whose affections are engaged
elsewhere.”
Dalibard trod on air as he left the house; his very
countenance had changed; he seemed ten years younger.
It was evening; and suddenly, as he came into Oxford
Street, he encountered a knot of young men—noisy and
laughing loud—obstructing the pavement, breaking jests
on the more sober passengers, and attracting the especial
and admiring attention of sundry ladies in plumed hats
and scarlet pelisses; for the streets then enjoyed a gay
liberty which has vanished from London with the lanterns

of the watchmen. Noisiest, and most conspicuous of these
descendants of the Mohawks, the sleek and orderly scholar
beheld the childish figure of his son. Nor did Gabriel
shrink from his father's eye, stern and scornful as it was,
but rather braved the glance with an impudent leer.
Right, however, in the midst of the group strode the
Provençal, and laying his hand very gently on the boy's
shoulder, he said—“My son, come with me.”
Gabriel looked irresolute, and glanced at his companions.
Delighted at the prospect of a scene, they now gathered
round, with countenances and gestures that seemed little
disposed to acknowledge the parental authority.
“Gentlemen,” said Dalibard, turning a shade more pale,
for though morally most resolute, physically he was not
brave—“gentlemen, I must beg you to excuse me—this
child is my son "
“But Art is his mother,” replied a tall raw-boned young
man, with long tawny hair streaming down from a hat
very much battered. “At the juvenile age, the child is
consigned to the mother! Have I said it?” and he turned
round theatrically to his comrades.
“Bravo!” cried the rest, clapping their hands.
“Down with all tyrants and fathers—hip, hip, hurrah!”
and the hideous diapason nearly split the drum of the ears
into which it resounded.
“Gabriel,” whispered the father, “you had better follow
me, had you not? Reflect!” So saying, he bowed low
to the unpropitious assembly, and, as if yielding the victory,
stepped aside and crossed over toward Bond Street.

Before the din of derision and triumph died away, Dali-
bard looked back, and saw Gabriel behind him.
“Approach, sir,” he said; and as the boy stood still, he
added, “I promise peace, if you will accept it.”
“Peace, then!” answered Gabriel, and he joined his
father's side.
“So,” said Dalibard, “when I consented to your study-
ing Art, as you call it, under your mother's most respecta-
ble brother, I ought to have contemplated what would be
the natural and becoming companions of the rising Raf-
faelle I have given to the world.”
“I own, sir,” replied Gabriel, demurely, “that they are
riotous fellows, but some of them are clever, and 17
“And excessively drunk,” interrupted Dalibard, examin-
ing the gait of his son. “Do you learn that accomplish-
ment also, by way of steadying your hand for the easel ?”
“No, sir; I like wine well enough, but I would not be
drunk for the world. I see people when they are drunk
are mere fools—let out their secrets, and show themselves
up.”
“Well said,” replied the father, almost admiringly;
“but a truce with this bantering, Gabriel. Can you im-
agine that I will permit you any longer to remain with
that vagabond Warney, and yon crew of Vauriens? You
will come home with me; and if you must be a painter, I
will look out for a more trustworthy master.”
“I shall stay where I am,” answered Gabriel, firmly,
and compressing his lips with a force that left them blood-
less.


## p. 188 (#194) ############################################

188 LUCRETIA.
“What, boy? do I hear right? Dare you disobey me?
Dare you defy "
“Not in your house, so I will not enter it again.”
Dalibard laughed mockingly.
“Peste! but this is modest! You are not of age yet,
Mr. Warney: you are not free from a father's tyrannical
control.”
“The law does not own you as my father, I am told,
sir; you have said my name rightly—it is Warney, not
Dalibard. . We have no rights over each other; so at least
says Tom Passmore, and his father's a lawyerſ”
Dalibard's hand griped his son's arm fiercely. Despite
his pain, which was acute, the child uttered no cry; but
he growled beneath his teeth, “Beware I beware l—or my
mother's son may avenge her death !”
Dalibard removed his hand and staggered as if struck.
Gliding from his side, Gabriel seized the occasion to
escape; he paused, however, midway in the dull lamp-lit
kennel, when he saw himself out of reach, and then ap-
proaching cautiously, said—“I know I am a boy, but you
have made me man enough to take care of myself. Mr.
Warney, my uncle, will maintain me—when of age, old Sir
Miles has provided for me. Leave me in peace—treat me
as free; and I will visit you, help you when you want me—
obey you still,—yes, follow your instructions; for I know
you are”—he paused—“you are wise; but if you seek
again to make me your slave, you will only find me your
foe. Good night; and remember that a bastard has no
father!”


## p. 189 (#195) ############################################

I, UCRETIA. 189
With these words he moved on, and hurrying down the
street, turned the corner and vanished.
Dalibard remained motionless for some minutes; at
length he muttered, “Ay, let him go, he is dangerous!
What son ever revolted even from the worst father, and
throve in life?—Food for the gibbet ! What matters?”
When next Dalibard visited Lucretia, his manner was
changed—the cheerfulness he had before assumed gave
place to a kind of melancholy compassion; he no longer
entered into her plans for the future, but would look at
her mournfully, start up, and walk away. She would have
attributed the change to some return of his ancient passion,
but she heard him once murmur, with unspeakable pity,
“Poor child—poor child I" A vague apprehension seized
her—first, indeed, caught from some remarks dropped by
Mr. Fielden, which were less discreet than Dalibard had
recommended. A day or two afterward, she asked Main-
waring, carelessly, “why he had never spoken to her at
Laughton of his acquaintance with Fielden.”
“You asked me that before,” he said somewhat sullenly.
“Did I? I forgot!” But how was it? Tell me
again.”
“I scarcely know,” he replied, confusedly; “we were
always talking of each other, or poor Sir Miles—our own
hopes and fears.”
This was true, and a lover's natural excuse. In the
present of love all the past is forgotten.
“Still,” said Lucretia, with her sidelong glance—“still,
as you must have seen much of my own sister 27

190 LU CRETIA.
Mainwaring, while she spoke, was at work on a button
on his gaiter—(gaiters were then worn tight at the ankle)
—the effort brought the blood to his forehead.
“But,” he said, still stooping at his occupation, “you
were so little intimate with your sister,--I feared to offend.
Family differences are so difficult to approach.”
Lucretia was satisfied at the moment. For so vast was
her stake in Mainwaring's heart, so did her whole heart
and soul grapple to the rock left serene amid the deluge,
that she habitually and resolutely thrust from her mind all
the doubts that at times invaded it.
“I know,” she would often say to herself—“I know he
does not love as I do—but man never can, never ought to
love as woman I Were I a man, I should scorn myself if
I could be so absorbed in one emotion as I am proud to
be now — I, poor woman l—I know,” again she would
think,-“I know how suspicious and distrustful I am—I
must not distrust him—I shall only irritate—I may lose
him : I dare not distrust—it would be too dreadful.”
Thus, as a system vigorously embraced by a determined
mind, she had schooled and forced herself into reliance on
her lover. His words now, we say, satisfied her at the
moment; but afterward, in absence, they were recalled, in
spite of herself—in the midst of fears, shapeless and unde-
fined. Involuntarily she began to examine the counte-
nance, the movements, of her sister—to court Susan's so-
ciety more than she had done—for her previous indifference
had now deepened into bitterness. Susan, the neglected
and despised, had become her equal—nay, more than her

equal—Susan's children would have precedence to her own
in the heritage of Laughton 1 Hitherto she had never
deigned to talk to her in the sweet familiarity of sisters
so placed—never deigned to confide to her those feelings
for her future husband, which burned lone and ardent in
the close vault of her guarded heart. Now, however, she
began to name him, wind her arm into Susan's, talk of love
and home, and the days to come; and as she spoke she
read the workings of her sister's face. That part of the
secret grew clear almost at the first glance. Susan loved
—loved William Mainwaring; but was it not a love hope-
less and unreturned? Might not this be the cause that
had made Mainwaring so reserved? He might have seen,
or conjectured, a conquest he had not sought; and hence,
with manly delicacy, he had avoided naming Susan to
Lucretia; and now, perhaps, sought the excuse which at
times had chafed and wounded her for not joining the
household circle. If one of those who glance over these
pages chance to be a person more than usually able and
acute—a person who has loved and been deceived—he or
she, no matter which, will perhaps recall those first mo-
ments when the doubt, long put off, insisted to be heard;
a weak and foolish heart gives way to the doubt at once,
not so the subtler and more powerful ; it rather, on the
contrary, recalls all the little circumstances that justify
trust and make head against suspicion; it will not render
the citadel at the mere sound of the trumpet; it arms all
its forces, and bars its gates on the foe. Hence it is, that
the persons most easy to dupe in matters of affection are

usually those most astute in the larger affairs of life.
Molière, reading every riddle in the vast complexities of
human character, and clinging, in self-imposed credulity,
to his profligate wife, is a type of a striking truth. Still,
a foreboding, a warning instinct withheld Lucretia from
plumbing farther into the deeps of her own fears. So hor-
rible was the thought that she had been deceived, that
rather than face it, she would have preferred to deceive
herself. This poor bad heart shrunk from inquiry—it
trembled at the idea of condemnation. She hailed, with a
sentiment of release that partook of rapture, Susan's abrupt
announcement one morning, that she had accepted an in-
vitation from some relations of her father, to spend some
time with them at their villa near Hampstead; she was to
go the end of the week. Lucretia hailed it, though she
saw the cause. Susan shrank from the name of Mainwar-
ing on Lucretia's lips—shrank from the familiar inter-
course so ruthlessly forced on her With a bright eye,
that day, Lucretia met her lover; yet she would not tell
him of Susan's intended departure—she had not the
courage.
Dalibard was foiled. This contradiction in Lucretia's
temper—so suspicious—so determined—puzzled even his
penetration. He saw that bolder tactics were required.
He waylaid Mainwaring on the young man's way to his
lodgings, and, after talking to him on indifferent matters,
asked him carelessly whether he did not think Susan far
gone in a decline. Affecting not to notice the convulsive
start with which the question was received, he went on:


## p. 193 (#199) ############################################

LUCRETIA. 193
“There is evidently something on her mind—I observe
that her eyes are often red as with weeping—poor girl l–
perhaps some silly love affair. However, we shall not see
her again before your marriage; she is going away in a
day or two; the change of air may possibly yet restore
her: I own, though, I fear the worst. At this time of the
year, and in your climate, such complaints as I take hers
to be are rapid. Good day. We may meet this evening.”
Terror-stricken at these barbarous words, Mainwaring
no sooner reached his lodgings than he wrote and dis-
patched a note to Fielden, entreating him to call.
The vicar obeyed the summons, and found Mainwaring
in a state of mind bordering on distraction; nor when
Susan was named did Fielden's words take the shape of
comfort; for he himself was seriously alarmed for her
health; the sound of her low cough rang in his ears, and
he rather heightened than removed the picture which
haunted Mainwaring—Susan, stricken, dying, broken-
hearted 1
Tortured both in heart and conscience, Mainwaring felt
as if he had but one wish left in the world—to see Susan
once more l What to say, he scarce knew ; but for her
to depart—depart, perhaps, to her grave, believing him
coldly indifferent—for her not to know, at least, his strug-
gles, and pronounce his pardon, was a thought beyond
endurance. After such an interview both would have
new fortitude—each would unite in encouraging the other
in the only step left to honor. And this desire he urged
upon Fielden, with all the eloquence of passionate grief,
vol. 1.-17 N

as he entreated him to permit and procure one last confer-
ence with Susan. But this, the plain sense and straight-
forward conscience of the good man long refused. If
Mainwaring had been left in the position to explain his
heart to Lucretia, it would not have been for Fielden to
object; but to have a clandestine interview with one sister
while betrothed to the other, bore in itself a character too
equivocal to meet with the simple vicar's approval.
“What can you apprehend ?” exclaimed the young man,
almost fiercely—for, harassed and tortured, his mild nature
was driven to bay. “Can you suppose that I shall en-
courage my own misery by the guilty pleadings of unavail-
ing love 7 All that I ask is the luxury—yes, the luxury,
long unknown to me, of candor—to place fairly and man-
fully before Susan the position in which fate has involved
me. Can you suppose that we shall not both take comfort
and strength from each other? Our duty is plain, and
obvious; but it grows less painful, encouraged by the lips
of a companion in suffering. I tell you fairly, that see
Susan I will and must. I will watch round her home
wherever it be—hour after hour—come what may, I will
find my occasion. Is it not better that the interview should
be under your roof, within the same walls which shelter
her sister 7 There, the place itself imposes restraint on
despair. Oh, sir, this is no time for formal scruples—be
merciful, I beseech you, not to me, but to Susan I I judge
of her by myself. I know that I shall go to the altar
more resigned to the future, if for once I can give vent to
what weighs upon my heart. She will then see as I do,

that the path before me is inevitable, she will uompose
herself to face the fate that compels us. We shall swear
tacitly to each other, not to love, but to conquer love.
Believe me, sir, I am not selfish in this prayer: an instinct,
the intuition which human grief has into the secrets of
human grief, assures me that that which I ask is the best
consolation you can afford to Susan. You own she is ill
—suffering. Are not your fears for her very life—O Hea-
ven, for her very life—gravely awakened 7 And yet yon
see we have been silent to each other l Can speech be
more fatal in its results than silence? Oh, for her sake
hear me!” -
The good man's tears fell fast—his scruples were
shaken; there was truth in what Mainwaring urged. He
did not yield; but he promised to reflect, and inform
Mainwaring, by a line, in the evening. Finding this was
all he could effect, the young man at last suffered him to
leave the house, and Fielden hastened to take counsel of
Dalibard; that wily persuader soon reasoned away Mr.
Fielden's last faint objection—it now only remained to
procure Susan's assent to the interview, and to arrange
that it should be undisturbed. Mr. Fielden should take
out the children the next morning. Dalibard volunteered
to contrive the absence of Lucretia at the hour appointed.
Mrs. Fielden, alone, should remain within, and might, if it
were judged proper, be present at the interview, which was
fixed for the forenoon in the usual drawing-room. Nothing
but Susan's consent was now necessary, and Mr. Fielden
ascended to her room. He knocked twice—no sweet voice

bade him enter; he opened the door gently—Susan was
in prayer. At the opposite corner of the room, by the
side of her bed, she knelt, her face buried in her hands,
and he heard, low and indistinct, the murmur broken by
the sob. But gradually, and, as he stood unperceived,
sob and murmur ceased—prayer had its customary and
blessed effect with the pure and earnest. And when Susan
rose, though the tears yet rolled down her cheeks, the face
was serene as an angel's.
The pastor approached and took her hand;—a blush
then broke over her countenance—she trembled, and her
eyes fell on the ground. “My child,” he said solemnly,
“God will hear you!” And, after those words, there was
a long silence. He then drew her passively toward a seat,
and sate down by her, embarrassed how to begin. At
length he said, looking somewhat aside, “Mr. Mainwar-
ing has made me a request—a prayer which relates to you,
and which I refer to you. He asks you to grant him an
interview before you leave us—to-morrow, if you will. I
refused at first—I am in doubt still ; for, my dear, I have
always found that, when the feelings move us, our duty
becomes less clear to the human heart—corrupt, we know
—but still it is often a safer guide than our reason; I
never knew reason unerring, except in mathematics; we
have no Euclid” (and the good man smiled mournfully) “in
the problems of real life; I will not urge you one way or
the other—I put the case before you. Would it, as the
young man says, give you comfort and strength to see him
once again while, while—in short, before your sister is—I

mean before—that is, would it soothe you now, to have an
unreserved communication with him 7 He implores it.
What shall I answer?”
“This trial, too!” muttered Susan, almost inaudibly—
“this trial which I once yearned for ”— and the hand
clasped in Fielden's was as cold as ice; then, turning her
eyes to her guardian somewhat wildly, she cried, “But to
what end? what object? why should he wish to see me?”
“To take greater courage to do his duty—to feel less
unhappy at-at-”
“I will see him,” interrupted Susan, firmly; “he is right,
it will strengthen both—I will see him 1"
“But human nature is weak, my child; if my heart be
so now, what will be yours?”
“Fear me not,” answered Susan, with a sad wandering
smile; and she repeated vacantly, “I will see him 1"
The good man looked at her, threw his arms round her
wasted form, and, lifting up his eyes, his lips stirred with
such half-syllabled words as fathers breathe on high.

CHA PTE R VIII.
THE DISCOVERY.
DALIBARD had undertaken to get Lucretia from the
house; in fact, her approaching marriage rendered neces-
sary a communication with Mr. Parchmount, as executor
to her uncle's will, relative to the transfer of her portion;
and she had asked Dalibard to accompany her thither, for
her pride shrank from receiving the lawyer in the shabby
parlor of the shabby lodging-house; she therefore, that
evening, fixed the next day, before noon, for the visit. A
carriage was hired for the occasion, and, when it drove off,
Mr. Fielden took his children a walk to Primrose Hill,
and called, as was agreed, on Mainwaring by the way.
The carriage had scarcely rattled fifty yards through
the street when Dalibard fixed his eyes, with deep and
solemn commiseration, on Lucretia. Hitherto, with mas-
terly art, he had kept aloof from direct explanations with
his pupil; he knew that she would distrust no one like
himself. The plot was now ripened, and it was time for
the main agent to conduct the catastrophe. The look
was so expressive that Lucretia felt a chill at her heart,
and could not help exclaiming, “What has happened?
you have some terrible tidings to communicate?”
“I have, indeed, to say that which may, perhaps, cause

you to hate me forever; as we hate those who report our
afflictions. I must endure this; I have struggled long
between my indignation and my compassion. Rouse up
your strong mind, and hear me. Mainwaring loves your
sister!”
Lucretia uttered a cry that seemed scarcely to come
from a human voice:
“No—no l’ she gasped out, “do not tell me. I will
hear no more—I will not believe you!”
With an inexpressible pity and softness in his tone, this
man, whose career had given him such profound expe-
rience in the frailties of the human heart, continued: “I
do not ask you to believe me, Lucretia; I would not now'
speak, if you had not the opportunity to convince your-
self; even those with whom you live are false to you; at
this moment, they have arranged all,—for Mainwaring to
steal, in your absence, to your sister; in a few moments
more he will be with her; if you yourself would learn
what passes between them, you have the power.”
“I have—I have not—not—the courage;—drive on—
faster–faster.”
Dalibard again was foiled. In this strange cowardice
there was something so terrible, yet so touching, that it
became sublime—it was the grasp of a drowning soul at
the last plank.
“You are right, perhaps,” he said, after a pause; and
wisely forbearing all taunt and resistance, he left the heart
To its own workings.
Suddenly, Lucretia caught at the check-string—“Stop,”

she exclaimed—“stop ! I will not, I cannot endure this
suspense, to last through a lifel I will learn the worst. Bid
him drive back.”
“We must descend and walk; you forget we must en-
ter unsuspected;” and Dalibard, as the carriage stopped,
opened the door and let down the steps.
Lucretia recoiled, then pressing one hand to her heart,
she descended without touching the arm held out to her.
Dalibard bade the coachman wait, and they walked back
to the house.
“Yes, he may see her,” exclaimed Lucretia, her face
brightening. “Ah, there you have not deceived me; I
see your stratagem—I despise it; I know she loves him;
she has sought this interview. He is so mild and gentle,
so fearful to give pain; he has consented, from pity——that
is all. Is he not pledged to me? He, so candid, so in-
genuous ! There must be truth somewhere in the world.
If he is false, where find truth? Dark man, must I look
for it in you ?—you!”
“It is not my truth I require you to test; I pretend not
to truth universal; I can be true to one, as you may yet
discover: but I own your belief is not impossible; my in
terest in you may have made me rash and unjust—what
you may overhear, far from destroying, may confirm for-
ever your happiness. Would that it may be sol”
“It must be so,” returned Lucretia, with a fearful gloom
on her brow and in her accent; “I will interpret every
word to my own salvation.”
Dalibard's countenance changed, despite his usual con-

trol over it. He had set all his chances upon this cast,
and it was more hazardous than he had deemed. He had
counted too much upon the jealousy of common natures.
After all, how little to the ear of one resolved to deceive
herself might pass between these young persons, meeting
not to avow attachment, but to take courage from each
other what restraint might they impose on their feelings!
Still the game must be played out.
As they now neared the house, Dalibard looked care-
fully round, lest they should encounter Mainwaring on his
way to it. He had counted on arriving before the young
man could get there.
“But,” said Lucretia, breaking silence, with an ironical
smile—“but (for your tender anxiety for me has, no doubt,
provided all means and contrivance, all necessary aids to
baseness and eaves dropping, that can assure my happi-
ness) how am I to be present at this interview?”
“I have provided, as you say,” answered Dalibard, in
the tone of a man deeply hurt, “those means which I, who
have found the world one foe and one traitor, deemed the
best, to distinguish falsehood from truth. I have arranged
that we shall enter the house unsuspected. Mainwaring
and your sister will be in the drawing-room—the room
next to it will be vacant, as Mr. Fielden is from home;
there is but a glass door between the two chambers.”
“Enough, enough 1” and Lucretia turned round, and
placed her hand lightly on the Provençal's arm. “The
next hour will decide whether the means you suggest, to
learn truth and defend safety, will be familiar or loathsome

to me for life—will decide whether trust is a madness-
whether you, my youth's teacher, are the wisest of men, or
only the most dangerous.”
“Believe me or not, when I say I would rather the
decision should condemn me; for I, too, have need of
confidence in men.”
Nothing further was said; the dull street was quiet
and desolate as usual. Dalibard had taken with him the
key of the house door. The door opened noiselessly—
they were in the house. Mainwaring's cloak was in the
hall; he had arrived a few moments before them. Dali-
bard pointed silently to that evidence in favor of his tale.
Lucretia bowed her head, but with a look that implied de-
fiance; and (still without a word) she ascended the stairs
and entered the room appointed for concealment. But as she
entered, at the farther corner of the chamber she saw Mrs
Fielden seated—seated, remote and out of hearing. The
good-natured woman had yielded to Mainwaring's prayer,
and Susan's silent look that enforced it, to let their inter-
view be unwitnessed. She did not perceive Lucretia till
the last walked glidingly, but firmly, up to her, placed a
burning hand on her lips, and whispered—“Hush, betray
me not; my happiness for life—Susan's—his—are at
stake 1 I must hear what passes; it is my fate that is
deciding. Hush—I command l—for I have the right!”
Mrs. Fielden was awed and startled; and before she
could recover even breath, Lucretia had quitted her side
and taken her post at the fatal door. She lifted the corner
of the curtain from the glass panel and looked in

Mainwaring was seated at a little distance from Susan,
whose face was turned from her. Mainwaring's counte-
nance was in full view. But it was Susan's voice that
met her ear; and though sweet and low, it was distinct,
and even firm. It was evident from the words that the
conference had just begun. s
“Indeed, Mr. Mainwaring, you have nothing to explain
—nothing of which to accuse yourself. It was not for
this, believe me”—and here Susan turned her face, and its
aspect of heavenly innocence met the dry lurid eye of the
unseen witness—“not for this, believe me, that I consented
to see you. If I did so, it was only because I thought—
because I feared from your manner, when we met at times,
still more from your evident avoidance to meet me at all,
that you were unhappy (for I know you kind and honest);
unhappy at the thought that you had wounded me, and
my heart could not bear that, nor, perhaps, my pride either.
That you should have forgotten me 17
“Forgotten you!”
“That you should have been captivated,” continued
Susan, in a more hurried tone, “by one so superior to me
in all things as Lucretia, is very natural. I thought, then
—thought only—that nothing could cloud your happiness
but some reproach of a conscience too sensitive. For this
I have met you—met you without a thought which Lu-
cretia would have a right to blame, could she read my
heart; met you,” and the voice for the first time faltered,
“that I might say, ‘Be at peace: it is your sister that
addresses you. Requite Lucretia's love—it is deep and

strong; give her as she gives to you—a whole heart; and
in your happiness, I, your sister—sister to both—I shall
be blest.’” With a smile inexpressibly touching and in-
genuous, she held out her hand as she ceased. Mainwar-
ing sprang forward, and, despite her struggle, pressed it
to his lips—his heart.
4. Oh,” he exclaimed, in broken accents, which gradually
became more clear and loud, “what—what have I lost!—
lost forever! No, no, I will be worthy of you ! I do not
—I dare not say that I love you still ! I feel what I owe
to Lucretia. How I became first ensnared, infatuated;
how, with your image graven so deeply here 77
“Mainwaring—Mr. Mainwaring—I must not hear you.
Is this your promise ?”
“Yes, you must hear me yet. How I became engaged
to your sister—so different, indeed, from you—I start in
amaze and bewilderment when I seek to conjecture. But
so it was. For me she has forfeited fortune, rank—all
which that proud, stern heart so prized and coveted.
Heaven is my witness how I have struggled to repay her
affection with my own; if I cannot succeed, at least all
that faith and gratitude can give are hers. Yes; when I
leave you, comforted by your forgiveness, your prayers, I
shall have strength to tear you from my heart—it is my
duty—my fate. With a firm step I will go to these ab-
horred nuptials. Oh, shudder not; turn not away! For-
give the word; but I must speak—my heart will out—
yes, abhorred nuptials | Between my grave and the altar,
would—would that I had a choice!”


## p. 205 (#211) ############################################

LUCRETIA. 205
From this burst, which in vain from time to time Susan
had sought to check, Mainwaring was startled by an ap-
parition which froze his veins, as a ghost from the grave.
The door was thrown open, and Lucretia stood in the
aperture—stood, gazing on him, face to face; and her
own was so colorless, so rigid, so locked in its livid and
awful solemnity of aspect, that it was, indeed, as one risen
from the dead.
Dismayed by the abrupt cry, and the changed face of
her lover, Susan turned and beheld her sister. With the
impulse of the pierced and loving heart, which divined all
the agony inflicted, she sprang to Lucretia's side—she fell
to the ground and clasped her knees.
“Do not heed—do not believe him: it is but the frenzy
of a moment. He spoke but to deceive me—me, who
loved him once! Mine alone—mine is the crime. He
knows all your worth ; pity—pity—pity on yourself, on
him—on me!’ -
Lucretia's eyes fell with the glare of a fiend upon the
imploring face lifted to her own. Her lips moved, but no
sound was audible. At length she drew herself from her
sister's clasp, and walked steadily up to Mainwaring. She
surveyed him with a calm and cruel gaze, as if she enjoyed
his shame and terror. Before, however, she spoke, Mrs.
Fielden, who had watched, as one spell-bound, Lucretia's
movements, and without hearing what had passed, had the
full foreboding of what would ensue, but had not stirred
till Lucretia herself terminated the suspense and broke
the charm of her awe, before she spoke, Mrs. Fielden

rushed in, and giving vent to her agitation in loud sobs,
as she threw her arms round Susan, who was still kneeling
on the floor, brought something of grotesque to the more
tragic and fearful character of the scene.
“My uncle was right; there is neither courage nor honor
in the low-born 1 He, the schemer, too, is right. All hol-
low—all false !” Thus said Lucretia, with a strange sort
of musing accent, at first scornful, at last only quietly ab-
stracted. “Rise, sir,” she then added, with her most
imperious tone; “do you not hear your Susan weep? do
you fear in my presence to console her ? Coward to her,
as forsworn to me. Go, sir, you are free!”
“Hear me,” faltered Mainwaring, attempting to seize
her hand; “I do not ask you to forgive; but 77
“Forgive, sir!” interrupted Lucretia, rearing her head,
and with a look of freezing and unspeakable majesty,
“there is only one person here who needs a pardon; but
her fault is inexpiable:-it is the woman who stooped be-
neath her 37 -
With these words, hurled from her with a scorn which
crushed, while it galled, she mechanically drew round her
form her black mantle; her eye glanced on the deep
mourning of the garment, and her memory recalled all that
that love had cost her; but she added no other reproach.
Slowly she turned away: passing Susan, who lay sense-
less in Mrs. Fielden's arms, she paused, and kissed her
forehead.
“When she recovers, madam,” she said to Mrs. Fielden,
who was moved and astonished by this softness, “say that

Lucretia Clavering uttered a vow, when she kissed the
brow of William Mainwaring's future wife I’
Olivier Dalibard was still seated in the parlor below
when Lucretia entered. Her face yet retained its almost
unearthly rigidity and calm; but a sort of darkness had
come over its ashen pallor—that shade so indescribable
which is seen in the human face, after long illness, a day
or two before death. Dalibard was appalled, for he had
too often seen that hue in the dying, not to recognize it
now. His emotion was sufficiently genuine to give more
than usual earnestness to his voice and gesture, as he
poured out every word that spoke sympathy and soothing.
For a long time Lucretia did not seem to hear him: at
last her face softened—the ice broke.
“Motherless—friendless—lone—alone forever—undone
—undone I" she murmured. Her head sunk upon the
shoulder of her fearful counselor, unconscious of its rest-
ing-place, and she burst into tears—tears which, perhaps,
saved her reason or her life.

A SOUL WITHOUT HOPE.
WHEN Mr. Fielden returned home, Lucreția had quitted
the house. She left a line for him in her usual bold, clear
handwriting, referring him to his wife for explanation of the
reasons that forbade a further residence beneath his roof.
She had removed to a hotel, until she had leisure to
arrange her plans for the future. In a few months, she
should be of age; and in the mean while, who now living
claimed authority over her? For the rest, she added, “I
repeat what I told Mr. Mainwaring, all engagement be-
tween us is at an end; he will not insult me either by
letter or by visit. It is natural that I should at present
shrink from seeing Susan Mivers. Hereafter, if permitted,
I will visit Mrs. Mainwaring.”
Though all had chanced as Mr. Fielden had desired (if,
as he once half meditated, he had spoken to Lucretia her-
self), though a marriage that could have brought happi-
ness to none, and would have made the misery of two, was
at an end, he yet felt a bitter pang, almost of remorse, when
he learned what had occurred. And Lucretia, before se-
cretly disliked (if any one he could dislike), became dear
to him at once, by sorrow and compassion. Forgetting
every other person, he hurried to the hotel Lucretia had

chosen, but her coldness deceived and her pride repelled
him. She listened dryly to all he said, and merely replied,
“I feel only gratitude at my escape. Let this subject now
close forever.”
Mr. Fielden left her presence with less anxious and com-
miserating feelings—perhaps all had chanced for the best.
And, on returning home, his whole mind became absorbed
in alarm for Susan. She was delirious and in great danger;
it was many weeks before she recovered. Meanwhile, Lu-
cretia had removed into private apartments, of which she
withheld the address. During this time, therefore, they
lost sight of her.
If, amid the punishments with which the somber imag-
ination of poets has diversified the Realm of the tortured
Shadows, it had depicted some soul condemned to look
evermore down into an abyss—all change to its gaze for-
bidden—chasm upon chasm, yawning deeper and deeper,
darker and darker, endless and infinite; so that, eternally
gazing, the soul became, as it were, a part of the abyss,
such an image would symbol forth the state of Lucretia's
mind.
It was not the mere desolation of one whom love has
abandoned and betrayed. In the abyss were mingled, in-
extricably together, the gloom of the past and of the future
—there, the broken fortunes, the crushed ambition, the
ruin of the worldly expectations long inseparable from her
schemes; and amid them, the angry shade of the more
than father, whose heart she had wrung, and whose old
age she had speeded to the grave. These sacrifices to

love, while love was left to her, might have haunted her at
moments, but a smile, a word, a glance banished the regret
and the remorse. Now, love being rased out of life, the
ruins of all else loomed dismal amid the darkness; and a
voice rose up, whispering, “Lo, fool! what thou hast lost
because thou didst believe and love!” And this thought
grasped together the two worlds of being—the what has
been, and the what shall be. All hope seemed stricken
from the future, as a man strikes from the calculations of
his income the returns from a property irrevocably lost.
At her age, but few of her sex have parted with religion;
but even such mechanical faith as the lessons of her child-
hood, and the constrained conformities with Christian cere-
monies, had instilled, had long since melted away in the
hard scholastic skepticism of her fatal tutor—a skepticism
which had won, with little effort, a reason delighting in
the maze of doubt, and easily narrowed into the cramped
and iron logic of disbelief, by an intellect that scorned to
submit where it failed to comprehend. Nor had faith
given place to those large moral truths from which phi
losophy has sought to restore the proud statue of Pagan
Virtue as a substitute for the meek symbol of the Christian
Cross. By temperament unsocial—nor readily moved to
the genial and benevolent—that absolute egotism in which
Olivier Dalibard centered his dreary ethics seemed sanc-
tioned to Lucretia by her studies into the motives of man
and the history of the world. She had read the chronicles
of states and the memoirs of statesmen, and seen how craft
carries on the movements of an age. Those Wiscontis,

Castruccios, and Medici-those Richelieus, and Mazarins,
and de Retzs—those Loyolas, and Mohammeds, and Crom-
wells—those Monks and Godolphins—those Marlboroughs
and Walpoles—those founders of history, and dynasties,
and sects—those leaders and dupers of men, greater or
lesser, corrupters or corrupt—all standing out prominent
and renowned from the guiltless and laurelless obscure—
seemed to win, by the homage of posterity, the rewards
that attend the deceivers of their time. By a superb ar-
rogance of generalization, she transferred into private life,
and the rule of commonplace actions, the policy that, to
the abasement of honor, has so often triumphed in the
guidance of states. Therefore, betimes, the whole frame of
society was changed to her eye, from the calm aspect it
wears to those who live united with their kind—she viewed
all seemings with suspicion; and before she had entered
the world, prepared to live in it as a conspirator in a city
convulsed, spying and espied, schemed against and schem-
ing—here the crown for the crafty, there the axe for the
outwitted.
But her love, for love is trust, had led her half way forth
from this maze of the intellect. That fair youth of inex-
perience and candor, which seemed to bloom out in the
face of her betrothed—his very shrinking from the schemes
so natural to her, that to her they seemed even innocent—
his apparent reliance on mere masculine ability, with the
plain aids of perseverance and honesty, all had an attrac-
tion that plucked her back from herself. If she clung to
him, firmly, blindly, credulously, it was not as the lover

alone. In the lover, she beheld the good angel. Had he
only died to her—still the angel smile would have sur-
vived and warned. But the man had not died—the angel
itself had deceived;—the wings could uphold her no more
—they had touched the mire, and were sullied with the
soil;-with the stain was forfeited the strength. All was
deceit and hollowness and treachery. Lone again in the
universe rose the eternal I. So down into the abyss she
looked, depth upon depth, and the darkness had no relief,
and the deep had no end.
Olivier Dalibard alone, of all she knew, was admitted to
her seclusion. He played his part as might be expected
from the singular patience and penetration which belonged
to the genius of his character. He forbore the most dis-
tant allusion to his attachment or his hopes. He evinced
sympathy rather, by imitating her silence, than attempts
to console. When he spoke, he sought to interest her
mind more than to heal directly the deep wounds of her
heart. There is always, to the afflicted, a certain charm
in the depth and bitterness of eloquent misanthropy. And
Dalibard, who professed not to be a man-hater, but a
world-scorner, had powers of language and of reasoning
commensurate with his astute intellect and his profound
research. His society became not only a relief, it grew
almost a want, to that stern sorrower. But, whether
alarmed or not by the influence she felt him gradually
acquiring, or whether, through some haughty desire to
rise once more aloft from the state of her rival and her
lover, she made one sudden effort to grasp at the rank from

which she had been hurled. The only living person whose
connection could reopen to her the great world, with its
splendors and its scope to ambition, was Charles Vernon.
She scarcely admitted to her own mind the idea that she
would now accept, if offered, the suit she had before de-
spised—she did not even contemplate the renewal of that
suit—though there was something in the gallant and dis-
interested character of Vernon which should have made
her believe he would regard their altered fortunes rather
as a claim on his honor than a release to his engagements.
But hitherto no communication had passed between them,
and this was strange if he retained the same intentions
which he had announced at Laughton. Putting aside,
we say, however, all such considerations, Vernon had
sought her friendship, called her “cousin,” enforced the
distant relationship between them. Not as lover, but as
kinsman, the only kinsman of her own rank she possessed
—his position in the world, his connections, his brilliant
range of acquaintance, made his counsel for her future
plans, his aid in the re-establishment of her consequence
(if not as wealthy, still as well born), and her admission
among her equals, of price and value. It was worth
sounding the depth of the friendship he had offered, even
if his love had passed away with the fortune on which
doubtless it had been based. -
She took a bold step—she wrote to Vernon—not even
to allude to what had passed between them: her pride
forbade such unwomanly vulgarity. The baseness that
was in her took at least a more delicate exterior. She

wrote to him simply and distantly, to state that there
were some books and trifles of hers left at Laughton,
which she prized beyond their trivial value; and to re-
quest, as she believed him to be absent from the hall, per-
mission to call at her old home, in her way to a visit in a
neighboring county, and point out to whomsoever he
might appoint to meet her, the effects she deemed herself
privileged to claim. The letter was one merely of busi-
ness, but it was a sufficient test of the friendly feelings of
her former suitor.
She sent this letter to Vernon's house in London, and
the next day came the answer.
Vernon, we must own, entirely sympathized with Sir
Miles, in the solemn injunctions the old man had be-
queathed. Immediately after the death of one to whom
we owe gratitude and love, all his desires take a sanctity
irresistible and ineffable. We adopt his affection, his dis-
likes, his obligations, and his wrongs. And after he had
read the copy of Lucretia's letter, inclosed to him by Sir
Miles, the conquest the poor baronet had made over re-
sentment and vindictive emotion, the evident effort at pas-
sionless justice with which he had provided becomingly
for his niece, while he canceled her claims as his heiress,
had filled Vernon with a reverence for his wishes and de-
cisions, that silenced all those inclinations to overgener-
osity which an unexpected inheritance is apt to create
toward the less fortunate expectants; nevertheless, Lu-
cretia's direct application, her formal appeal to his com-
mon courtesy as host and kinsman, perplexed greatly a

man ever accustomed to a certain chivalry toward the
sex; the usual frankness of his disposition suggested, how-
ever, plain dealing as the best escape from his dilemma,
and therefore he answered thus:
“MADAM, Under other circumstances it would have
given me no common pleasure to place the house, that
you so long inhabited, again at your disposal. And I
feel so painfully the position which my refusal of your
request inflicts upon me, that rather than resort to excuses
and pretexts, which, while conveying an impression of my
sincerity, would seem almost like an insult to yourself, I
venture frankly to inform you that it was the dying wish
of my lamented kinsman, in consequence of a letter which
came under his eye, that the welcome you had hitherto
received at Laughton should be withdrawn. Pardon me,
Madam, if I express myself thus bluntly—it is somewhat
necessary to the vindication of my character in your eyes,
both as regards the honor of your request and my tacit
resignation of hopes, fervently, but too presumptuously,
entertained. In this most painful candor, Heaven forbid
that I should add wantonly to your self-reproaches for the
fault of youth and inexperience, which I should be the
last person to judge rigidly, and which, had Sir Miles's
life been spared, you would doubtless have amply repaired.
The feelings which actuated Sir Miles in his latter days
might have changed; but the injunction those feelings
prompted I am bound to respect.
“For the mere matter of business, on which you have

done me the honor to address me, I have only to say, that
any orders you may give to the steward, or transmit
through any person you may send to the hall, with regard
to the effects you so naturally desire to claim, shall be
implicitly obeyed. -
“And believe me, Madam (though I do not presume to
add those expressions, which might rather heighten the
offense I fear this letter will give you), that the assurance
of your happiness in the choice you have made, and which
now no obstacle can oppose, will considerably lighten the
pain with which I shall long recall my ungracious reply
to your communication.
“I have the honor to be, etc. etc.
“C. WERNoN ST. John.
“Brook Street, Dec. 18th, 18–.”
The receipt of such a letter could hardly add to the
profounder grief which preyed in the innermost core of
Lucretia's heart, but in repelling the effort she had made
to distract that grief by ambition, it blackened the sullen
despondency with which she regarded the future. As the
insect in the hollow snare of the ant-lion, she felt that
there was no footing up the sides of the cave into which
she had fallen — the sand gave way to the step. But
despondency in her brought no meekness—the cloud did
not descend in rain;–resting over the horizon, its dark-
ness was tinged with the fires which it fed. The heart,
already so embittered, was stung and mortified into intol-
erable shame and wrath. From the home that should

have been hers, in which, as acknowledged heiress, she had
smiled down on the ruined Vernon, she was banished by
him who had supplanted her, as one worthless and polluted.
Though, from motives of obvious delicacy, Vernon had
not said expressly that he had seen the letter to Mainwar-
ing, the unfamiliar and formal tone which he assumed
indirectly declared it, and betrayed the impression it had
made, in spite of his reserve. A living man then was in
possession of a secret which justified his disdain, and that
man was master of Laughton l The suppressed rage which
embraced the lost lover extended darkly over this witness
to that baffled and miserable love. But what availed rage
against either? Abandoned and despoiled, she was power-
less to avenge. It was at this time, when her prospects
seemed most dark, her pride was most crushed, and her
despair of the future at its height, that she turned to Dali- .
bard as the only friend left to her under the sun. Even
the vices she perceived in him became merits, for they for-
bade him to despise her. And now, this man rose sud-
denly into another and higher aspect of character: of late,
though equally deferential to her, there had been some-
thing more lofty in his mien, more assured on his brow;
gleams of a secret satisfaction, even of a joy, that he ap-
peared anxious to suppress, as ill in harmony with her
causes for dejection, broke out in his looks and words. At
length, one day, after some preparatory hesitation, he in-
formed her that he was free to return to France—that
even without the peace between England and France,

which (known under the name of the Peace of Amiens)
had been just concluded, he should have crossed the chan-
nel. The advocacy and interest of friends, whom he had
left at Paris, had already brought him under the special
notice of the wonderful man who then governed France,
and who sought to unite in its service every description
and variety of intellect. He should return to France, and
then—why, then, the ladder was on the walls of Fortune
and the foot planted on the step ! As he spoke, confi-
dently and sanguinely, with the verve and assurance of an
able man who sees clear the path to his goal, as he sketched
with rapid precision the nature of his prospects and his
hopes, all that subtle wisdom which had before often
seemed but vague and general, took practical shape and
interest thus applied to the actual circumstances of men;
the spirit of intrigue, which seemed mean when employed
on mean things, swelled into statesmanship and masterly
genius to the listener, when she saw it linked with the
large objects of masculine ambition. Insensibly, there-
fore, her attention became earnest—her mind aroused. The
vision of a field afar from the scenes of her humiliation
and despair—a field for energy, stratagem, and contest—
invited her restless intelligence. As Dalibard had pro-
foundly calculated, there was no new channel for her affec-
tions—the source was dried up, and the parched sands
heaped over it; but while the heart lay dormant, the mind
rose, sleepless, chafed, and perturbed. Through the mind,
he indirectly addressed and subtly wooed her.

part alonel” -
“Alone !” that word, more than once that day, Lucretia
repeated to herself—“alone!”—and what career was left
to her—she, too, alonel
In certain stages of great grief our natures yearn for
excitement. This has made some men gamblers; it has
made even women drunkards—it had effect over the serene
calm and would-be divinity of the Poet-sage. When his
son dies, Goethe does not mourn—he plunges into the ab-
sorption of a study uncultivated before. But, in the
great contest of life, in the whirlpool of actual affairs, the
stricken heart finds all—the gambling, the inebriation, and
the study.
We pause here. We have pursued long enough that
patient analysis, with all the food for reflection that it
possibly affords, to which we were insensibly led on by an
interest, dark and fascinating, that grew more and more
upon us, as we proceeded in our research into the early
history of a person fated to pervert no ordinary powers
into no commonplace guilt.
The charm is concluded—the circle closed round—the
self-guided seeker after knowledge has gained the fiend
for the familiar.

THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN FATHER AND SON.
WE pass over an interval of some months.
A painter stood at work at the easel; his human model
before him. He was employed on a nymph—the Nymph
Galatea. The subject had been taken before by Salvator,
whose genius found all its elements in the wild rocks,
gnarled fantastic trees, and gushing waterfalls of the land-
scape—in the huge ugliness of Polyphemus the lover—in
the grace and suavity and unconscious abandonment of the
nymph, sleeking her tresses dripping from the bath. The
painter, on a larger canvas (for Salvator's picture, at least
the one we have seen, is among the small sketches of the
great artistic creator of the romantic and grotesque), had
transferred the subject of the master; but he had left
subordinate the landscape and the giant, to concentrate
all his art on the person of the Nymph. Middle-aged was
the painter, in truth; but he looked old. His hair, though
long, was gray and thin; his face was bloated by intem-
perance; and his hand trembled much, though from habit
no trace of the tremor was visible in his work.
A boy, near at hand, was also employed on the same sub-
ject, with a rough chalk and a bold freedom of touch. He
was sketching his design of a Galatea and Polyphemus on

the wall; for the wall was only whitewashed, and covered
already with the multiform vagaries whether of master or
pupil: caricatures and demigods, hands and feet, torsos,
and monsters, and Venuses—the rude creations, all muti-
lated, jarring and mingled, gave a cynical, mocking, devil-
may-care kind of aspect to the sanctum of art. It was like
the dissection-room of the anatomist. The boy's sketch
was more in harmony with the walls of the studio than the
canvas of the master. His nymph, accurately drawn from
the undressed proportions of the model down to the waist,
terminated in the scales of a fish. The forked branches of
the trees stretched weird and imp-like as the hands of skele-
tons. Polyphemus, peering over the rocks, had the leer
of a demon; and in his gross features there was a certain
distorted, hideous likeness of the grave and symmetrical
lineaments of Olivier Dalibard.
All around was slovenly, squalid, and poverty-stricken;
rickety, wornout, rush-bottom chairs; unsold, unfinished
pictures, pell-mell in the corner, covered with dust; broken
easts of plaster; a lay-figure battered in its basket-work
arms, with its doll-like face, all smudged and besmeared:
a pot of porter and noggin of gin on a stained deal table,
accompanied by two or three broken, smoke-blackened
pipes, some tattered song-books, and old numbers of the
Covent Garden Magazine, betrayed the tastes of the artist,
and accounted for the shaking hand and the bloated form.
A jovial, disorderly, vagrant dog of a painter, was Tom
Warney!—a bachelor, of course—humorous and droll—a
boon companion, and a terrible borrower: clever enough

in his calling; with pains and some method, he had easily
gained subsistence and established a name; but he had
one trick that soon ruined him in the business part of his
profession. He took a fourth of his price in advance; and
having once clutched the money, the poor customer might
go hang for his picturel The only things Tom Warney
ever fairly completed were those for which no order had
been given; for in them, somehow or other, his fancy
became interested, and on them he lavished the gusto
which he really possessed. But the subjects were rarely
salable. Nymphs and deities undraperied have few wor-
shipers in England among the buyers of “furniture pic-
tures.” And to say truth, nymph and deity had usually a
very equivocal look; and if they came from the gods, you
would swear it was the gods of the galleries of Drury.
When Tom Warney sold a picture, he lived upon clover
till the money was gone. But the poorer and less steady
alumni of the rising school, especially those at war with
the Academy from which Warney was excluded, pitied,
despised, yet liked and courted him withal. In addition
to his good qualities of blithe song-singer, droll story-
teller, and stanch Bacchanalian, Tom Warney was liberally
good natured in communicating instruction really valuable
to those who knew how to avail themselves of a knowledge
he had made almost worthless to himself. He was a shrewd,
though good-natured critic, had many little secrets of color-
ing and composition, which an invitation to supper, or the
loan of ten shillings, was sufficient to bribe from him.
Ragged, out of elbows, unshaven, and slipshod, he still

had his set, among the gay and the young—a precious
master, a profitable set, for his nephew, Master Honoré
Gabriell But the poor rapscallion had a heart larger
than many honest painstaking men. As soon as Gabriel
had found him out, and entreated refuge from his fear of
his father, the painter clasped him tight in his great slovenly
arms, sold a Venus half price, to buy him a bed and a
wash-stand, and swore a tremendous oath, “that the son
of his poor guillotined sister should share the last shilling
in his pocket—the last drop in his can.”
Gabriel, fresh from the cheer of Laughton, and spoiled
by the prodigal gifts of Lucretia, had little gratitude for
shillings and porter. Nevertheless, he condescended to
take what he could get, while he sighed, from the depths
of a heart in which cupidity and vanity had become the
predominant rulers, for a destiny more worthy his genius,
and more in keeping with the sphere from which he had
descended.
The boy finished his sketch, with an impudent wink
at the model flung himself back on his chair, folded his
arms, cast a discontented glance at the whitened seams
of his sleeves, and soon seemed lost in his own reflec-
tions. The painter worked on in silence. The model,
whom Gabriel's wink had aroused, half flattered, half
indignant for a moment, lapsed into a doze. Outside
the window, you heard the song of a canary—a dingy,
smoke-colored canary—that seemed shedding its plumes,
for they were as ragged as the garments of its master;
still it contrived to sing—trill-trill-trill-trill-trill, as blithely

as if free in its native woods, or pampered by fair hands in
a gilded cage. The bird was the only true artist there: it
sang, as the poet sings, to obey its nature and vent its
heart. Trill-trill-trillela-la-la-trill-trill, went the song—
louder, gayer than usual—for there was a gleam of April
sunshine, struggling over the roof-tops. The song at
length roused up Gabriel; he turned his chair round, laid
his head on one side, listened, and looked curiously at the
bird.
At length an idea seemed to cross him: he rose, opened
the window, drew in the cage, placed it on the chair, then
took up one of his uncle's pipes, walked to the fire-place,
and thrust the shank of the pipe into the bars. When it
was red hot, he took it out by the bowl, having first pro-
teeted his hand from the heat by wrapping round it his
handkerchief; this done, he returned to the cage. His
movements had wakened up the dozing model. She eyed
them at first with dull curiosity, then with lively suspicion;
and presently starting up with an exclamation such as no
novelist but Fielding dare put into the mouth of a female
—much less a nymph of such renown as Galatea—she
sprang across the room, well-nigh upsetting easel and
painter, and fastened firm hold on Gabriel's shoulders.
“The varment l” she cried, vehemently; “the good-for-
nothing warment! If it had been a jay, or a nasty raven,
well and good!—but a poor little canary 1”
“Hoity-toity what are you about, nephew 7 What's
the matter?” said Tom Warney, coming up to the strife.
And, indeed, it was time, for Gabriel's teeth were set in his

cat-like jaws, and the glowing point of the pipe-shank was
within an inch of the cheek of the model.
“What's the matter?” replied Gabriel, sullenly; “why,
I was only going to try a little experiment.”
“An experiment? not on my canary, poor, dear little
thing l—the hours and hours that creature has strained its
throat to say—‘sing and be merry,’ when I had not a
rap in my pocket! It would have made a stone feel to
hear it.”
“But I think I can make it sing much better than ever
—only just let me try ! They say, that if you put out the
eyes of a canary, it—” Gabriel was not allowed to con-
clude his sentence; for here rose that clamor of horror
and indignation, from both painter and model, which
usually greets the announcement of every philosophical
discovery—at least, when about to be practically applied;
and in the midst of the hubbub, the poor little canary,
who had been fluttering about the cage to escape the hand
of the benevolent operator, set up no longer the cheerful
trill-trillela-la-trill, but a scared and heart-breaking chirp
—a shrill, terrified twit-twit.twitter-twit.
“Damn the bird!—hold your tongues!” cried Gabriel
Warney, reluctantly giving way; but still eyeing the bird
with the scientific regret with which the illustrious Ma-
jendie might contemplate a dog which some brute of a
master refused to disembowel for the good of the colics of
mankind.
The model seized on the cage, shut the door of the
wires, and carried it off. Tom Warney drained the rest of

his porter, and wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his
coat.
“And to use my pipe for such crueltyl Boy, boy, I
could not have believed it! But you were not in earnest
—oh, no, impossible! Sukey, my love—Galatea, the di-
vine—calm thy breast; Cupid did but jest:
“Cupid is the god of laughter,
Quip, and jest, and joke, sir.”
“If you don't whip the little wretch within an inch of
his life, he'll have a gallows end on't,” replied Galatea.
“Go, Cupid, go and kiss Galatea, and make your peace:
“Oh, leave a kiss within the cup,
And I'll not ask for wine!”
And 'tis no use asking for wine, or for gin either—not a
drop in the noggin!”
All this while, Gabriel, disdaining the recommendations
held forth to him, was employed in brushing his jacket
with a very mangy-looking brush; and when he had com-
pleted that operation, he approached his uncle and coolly
thrust his hands into that gentleman's waistcoat-pockets.
“Uncle, what have you done with those seven shillings?
I am going out to spend the day.”
“If you give them to him, Tom, I'll scratch your eyes
out,” cried the model; “and then we'll see how you'll
sing. Whip him, I say—whip him 1"
But, strange to say, this liberty of the boy's quite re-
opened the heart of his uncle—it was a pleasure to him,
who put his hands so habitually into other people's pock-

ets, to be invested with the novel grandeur of the man
sponged upon. “That's right, Cupid, son of Cytherea;
all's common property among friends. Seven shillings, I
have 'em not! “They now are five who once were seven;’
but such as they are, we'll share l
“Let old Timotheus yield the prize,
Or both divide the crown.’”
“Crowns bear no division, my uncle,” said Gabriel,
dryly—and he pocketed the five shillings. Then, having
first secured his escape, by gaining the threshold, he sud-
denly seized one of the rickety chairs by its leg, and, re-
gardless of the gallantries due to the sex, sent it right
against the model, who was shakºng her fist at him. A
scream, and a fall, and a sharp twit from the cage, which
was hurled nearly into the fire-place, told that the missive
had taken effect. Gabriel did not wait for the probable
reaction; he was in the streets in an instant.
“This won't do,” he muttered to himself; “there is no
getting on here. Foolish, drunken vagabond l no good
to be got from him. My father is terrible, but he will
make his way in the world. Umph 1 if I were but his
..match—and why not? I am brave, and he is not. There's
fun, too, in danger.”
Thus musing, he took his way to Dalibard's lodgings.
IIis father was at home. Now, though they were but
lodgings, and the street not in fashion, Olivier Dalibard's
apartments had an air of refinement, and even elegance,
that contrasted both the wretched squalor of the abode

223 LUCRETIA,
Gabriel had just left, and the meanness of Dalibard's for-
mer quarters in London. The change seemed to imply
that the Provençal had already made some way in the
world. And, truth to say, at all times, even in the lowest
ebb of his fortunes, there was that indescribable neatness
and formality of precision about all the exterior seemings
of the ci-devant friend of the prim Robespierre which
belong to those in whom order and method are strongly
developed—qualities which give even to neediness a cer-
tain dignity. As the room and its owner met the eye of
Gabriel, on whose senses all externals had considerable
influence, the ungrateful young ruffian recalled the kind,
tattered slovenly uncle, whose purse he had just emptied,
without one feeling miſder than disgust. Olivier Dali-
bard, always careful, if simple, in his dress, with his brow
of grave intellectual power, and his mien imposing, not
only from its calm, but from that nameless refinement which
rarely fails to give to the student the air of a gentleman,
—Olivier Dalibard he might dread—he might even detest;
but he was not ashamed of him.
“I said I would visit you, sir, if you would permit me,”
said Gabriel, in a tone of respect, not unmingled with
some defiance, as if in doubt of his reception.
The father's slow full eye, so different from the sidelong
furtive glance of Lucretia, rested on the son, as if to pen-
etrate his very heart.
“You look pale and haggard, child: you are fast losing
your health and beauty. Good gifts these, not to be
wasted before they can be duly employed. But you have

taken your choice. Be an artist—copy Tom Warney, and
prosper.”
Gabriel remained silent, with his eyes on the floor.
“You come in time for my farewell,” resumed Dalibard.
“It is a comfort, at least, that I leave your youth so honor-
ably protected. I am about to return to my country—my
career is once more before me !”
“Your country—to Paris?”
“There are fine pictures in the Louvre—a good place
to inspire an artist l”
“You go alone, father?”
“You forget, young gentleman, you disown me as fatherl
Go alonel I thought I told you, in the times of our confi-
dence, that I should marry Lucretia Clavering. I rarely
fail in my plans. She has lost Laughton, it is true, but
ten thousand pounds will make a fair commencement to
fortune, even at Paris. Well, what do you want with me,
worthy godson of Honoré Gabriel Mirabeau?”
“Sir, if you will let me, I will go with you.”
Dalibard shaded his brow with his hand, and reflected
on the filial proposal. On the one hand, it might be con-
venient, and would certainly be economical to rid himself
evermore of the mutinous son who had already thrown off
his authority; on the other hand, there was much in Ga-
briel, mutinous and even menacing as he had lately become,
that promised an unscrupulous tool or a sharp-witted ac-
complice, with interests that every year the ready youth
would more and more discover were bound up in his plot-
ting father's. This last consideration, joined, if not to

affection, still to habit—to the link between blood and
blood, which even the hardest find it difficult to sever, pre-
vailed. He extended his pale hand to Gabriel, and said,
gently :
“I will take you, if we rightly understand each other.
Once again in my power, I might constrain you to my
will, it is true. But I rather confer with you as man to
man than as man to boy.”
“It is the best way,” said Gabriel, firmly.
“I will use no harshness—inflict no punishment, unless,
indeed, amply merited by stubborn disobedience or willful
deceit. But if I meet with these, better rot on a dunghill
than come with me ! I ask implicit confidence in all my
suggestions, prompt submission to all my requests. Grant
me but these, and I promise to consult your fortune as my
own—to gratify your tastes as far as my means will allow
—to grudge not your pleasures; and, when the age for
ambition comes, to aid your rise if I rise myself; nay, if
well contented with you, to remove the blot from your
birth, by acknowledging and adopting you formally as my
Son.”
“Agreed l and I thank you,” said Gabriel. “And Lu-
cretia is going, oh, I so long to see her 1"
“See her—not yet; but next week.”
“Do not fear that I should let out about the letter. I
should-betray myself if I did,” said the boy, bluntly betray-
.ing his guess at his father's delay.
The evil scholar smiled.

for mine, I should not fear. Gabriel, go back now to your
master—you do right, like the rats, to run from the falling
house. Next week, I will send for you, Gabriell”
Not, however, back to the studio went the boy. He
sauntered leisurely through the gayest streets, eyed the
shops and the equipages, the fair women and the well-
dressed men—eyed with envy, and longings, and visions of
pomps and vanities to come; then, when the day began
to close, he sought out a young painter, the wildest and
maddest of the crew to whom his uncle had presented
their future comrade and rival, and went with this youth,
at half price, to the theater, not to gaze on the actors or
study the play, but to stroll in the saloon. A supper in
the Finish completed the void in his pockets, and con-
cluded his day's rank experience of life. By the gray
dawn he stole back to his bed, and as he laid himself down,
he thought with avid pleasure of Paris, its gay gardens,
and brilliant shops, and crowded streets: he thought, too,
of his father's calm confidence of success, of the triumph
that already had attended his wiles—a confidence and a
triumph which, exciting his reverence and rousing his
emulation, had decided his resolution. He thought, too,
of Lucretia, with something of affection, recalled her
praises and bribes, her frequent mediation with his father,
and felt that they should have need of each other. Oh,
no, he never would tell her of the snare laid at Guy's Oak
—never, not even if incensed with his father! An instinct
told him that that offense could never be forgiven, and
that, henceforth, Lucretia's was a destiny bound up in his

own. He thought, too, of Dalibard's warning and threat.
But, with fear itself, came a strange excitement of pleasure
—to grapple, if necessary, he a mere child, with such a
man l—his heart swelled at the thought. So, at last, he
fell asleep, and dreamed that he saw his mother's trunkless
face dripping gore, and frowning on him—dreamed that
he heard her say: “Goest thou to the scene of my execu-
.tion only to fawn upon my murderer?” Then a night-
mare of horrors, of scaffolds, and executioners, and grin-
ning mobs, and agonized faces, came on him—dark,
confused, and indistinct. And he woke, with his hair
standing on end, and heard below, in the rising sun, the
merry song of the poor canary—trill-lill-lill, trill-trill-lill-
lill-lal Did he feel glad that his cruel hand had been

EPILOGUE TO PART THE FIRST.
IT is a year since the November day on which Lucretia
Clavering quitted the roof of Mr. Fielden. And first we
must recall the eye of the reader to the old-fashioned ter-
race of Laughton; the jutting porch, the quaint balus-
trades, the broad, dark, changeless cedars on the lawn
beyond. The day is calm, clear, and mild, for November
in the country is often a gentle month. On that terrace
walked Charles Vernon, now known by his new name of
St. John. Is it the change of name that has so changed
the person? Can the wand of the Herald's Office have
filled up the hollows of the cheek, and replaced by elastic
vigor the listless languor of the tread? No; there is an-
other and a better cause for that healthful change. Mr.
Vernon St. John is not alone—a fair companion leans on
his arm. See, she pauses to press closer to his side, gaze
on his face, and whisper, “We did well to have hope and
faith !” ~
The husband's faith had not been so unshaken as his
Mary's, and a slight blush passed over his cheek as he
thought of his concession to Sir Miles's wishes, and his
overtures to Lucretia Clavering. Still that fault had been
fairly acknowledged to his wife, and she felt, the moment
she had spoken, that she had committed an indiscretion;

nevertheless, with an arch touch of womanly malice, she
added softly: f
“And Miss Clavering, you persist in saying, was not
really handsome 7”
“My love,” replied the husband, gravely, “you would
oblige me by not recalling the very painful recollections
connected with that name. Let it never be mentioned in
this house.”
Lady Mary bowed her graceful head in submission—
she understood Charles's feelings. For though he had not
shown her Sir Miles's letter and its inclosure, he had com-
municated enough to account for the unexpected heritage,
and to lessen his wife's compassion for the disappointed
heiress. Nevertheless, she comprehended that her hus-
band felt an uneasy twinge at the idea that he was com-
pelled to act hardly to the one whose hopes he had
supplanted. Lucretia's banishment from Laughton was
a just humiliation, but it humbled a generous heart to
inflict the sentence. Thus, on all accounts, the remem-
brance of Lucretia was painful and unwelcome to the suc-
cessor of Sir Miles. There was a silence—Lady Mary
pressed her husband's hand.
“It is strange,” said he, giving vent to his thoughts at
that tender sign of sympathy in his feeling — “strange
that, after all, she did not marry Mainwaring, but fixed
her choice on that supple Frenchman. But she has set-
tled abroad now, perhaps for life—a great relief to my
omind. Yes, let us never recur to her.”
“Fortunately,” said Lady Mary, with some hesitation,

I, UCRETIA. 235
“she does not seem to have created much interest here.
The poor seldom name her to me, and our neighbors only
with surprise at her marriage. In another year she will
be forgotten "
Mr. St. John sighed. . Perhaps he felt how much more
easily he had been forgotten, were he the banished one,
Lucretia the possessorl His light nature, however, soon
escaped from all thoughts and sources of annoyance, and
he listened with complacent attention to Lady Mary's
gentle plans for the poor, and the children's school, and
the cottages that ought to be repaired, and the laborers
that ought to be employed. For, though it may seem
singular, Vernon St. John, insensibly influenced by his
wife's meek superiority, and corrected by her pure com-
panionship, had begun to feel the charm of innocent occu-
pations;—more, perhaps, than if he had been accustomed
to the larger and loftier excitements of life, and missed
that stir of intellect which is the element of those who
have warred in the democracy of letters or contended for
the leadership of states. He had begun already to think
that the country was no such exile after all. Naturally
benevolent, he had taught himself to share the occupations
his Mary had already found in the busy “luxury of doing
good,” and to conceive that brotherhood of charity which
usually unites the lord of the village with its poor.
“I think, what with hunting once a week,-(I will not
venture more till my pain in the side is quite gone), and
with the help of some old friends at Christmas, we can get
through the winter very well, Mary.”

“Ah, those old friends! I dread them more than the
hunting!”
“But we'll have your grave father, and your dear, pre- -
cise, excellent mother, to keep us in order. And if I sit
more than half an hour after dinner, the old butler shall
pull me out by the ears. Mary, what do you say to thin-

“Fifty years hence, Charles!”
“It is our duty to think of posterity,” answered the
ci-devant spendthrift, with a gravity that was actually
pompous. “But hark 1 is that two o'clock? Three, by
Jovel How time flies 1 and my new bullocks that I was

Put me in mind, by-the-by, to write to Coke about his

“This way, dear Charles; we can go round by the vil-
lage, and see poor Ponto and Dash.”
The tears rushed to Mr. St. John's eyes. “If poor Sir
Miles could have known you!” he said, with a sigh; and,
though the gardeners were at work on the lawn, he bowed

his head, and kissed the blushing cheek of his wife as
heartily as if he had been really a farmer.
From the terrace at Laughton, turn to the humbler
abode of our old friend the vicar—the same day, the same
hour. Here also the scene is without doors—we are in
the garden of the vicarage; the children are playing at
hide-and-seek among the espaliers, which screen the wind-
ing gravel walks from the esculents more dear to Ceres
than to Flora. The vicar is seated in his little parlor,
from which a glazed door admits into the garden. The
door is now open, and the good man has paused from his
work (he had just discovered a new emendation in the first
chorus of the Medea), to look out at the rosy faces that
gleam to and fro across the scene. His wife, with a
basket in her hand, is standing without the door, but a
little aside, not to obstruct the view.
“It does one's heart good to see them " said the vicar;
“little dears!”
“Yes, they ought to be dear at this time of the year,”
observed Mrs. Fielden, who was absorbed in the contents
of the basket.
“And so fresh ſº
“Fresh, indeed!—how different from London 1 In
London they were not fit to be seen; as old as–I am
sure I can't guess how old they were. But you see here
they are new laid every morning !”
“My dear!” said Mr. Fielden, opening his eyes—“new
laid every morning?”
“Two dozen and four.”

“Two dozen and four !—What on earth are you talking
about, Mrs. Fielden 7”
“Why, the eggs to be sure, my love!”
“Oh!” said the vicar, “two dozen and four !—you
alarmed me a little; 'tis of no consequence—only my
foolish mistake. Always prudent and saving, my dear
Sarah; just as if poor Sir Miles had not left us that
munificent fortune, I may call it.”
“It will not go very far when we have our young ones
to settle. And—David is very extravagant already: he
has torn such a hole in his jacket !”
At this moment, up the gravel walk, two young persons
came in sight. The children darted across them, whooping
and laughing, and vanished in the farther recess of the
garden.
“All is for the best—blind mortals that we are l—all is
for the best!” said the vicar, musingly, as his eyes rested
upon the approaching pair.
“Certainly, my love; you are always right, and it is
wicked to grumble. Still, if you saw what a hole it was
—past patching, I fear !”
“Look round !” said Mr. Fielden, benevolently. “How
we grieved for them both; how wroth we were with Wil-
liam—how sad for Susan l And now see them—they will
be the better man and wife for their trial ſ”
“Has Susan then consented 7 I was almost afraid she
never would consent. How often have I been almost
angry with her, poor lamb I when I have heard her accuse
herself of causing her sister's unhappiness, and declare,

with sobs, that she felt it a crime to think of William
Mainwaring as a husband.”
“I trust I have reasoned her out of a morbid sensibility
which, while it could not have rendered Lucretia the hap-
pier, must have insured the wretchedness of herself and
william. But if Lucretia had not married, and so forever
closed the door on William's repentance (that is, suppos-
ing he did repent), I believe poor Susan would rather
have died of a broken heart than have given her hand
to Mainwaring.”
“It was an odd marriage of that proud young lady's,
after all,” said Mrs. Fielden; “so much older than her—a
foreigner, too !”
“But he is a very pleasant man, and they had known
each other so long. I did not, however, quite like a sort
of cunning he showed, when I came to reflect on it, in
bringing Lucretia back to the house; it looks as if he had
laid a trap for her from the first.”
“Ten thousand pounds!—a great catch for a foreigner!”
observed Mrs. Fielden, with the shrewd instinct of her sex;
and then she added, in the spirit of a prudent sympathy
equally characteristic :- “but I think you say Mr. Parch-
mount persuaded her to allow half to be settled on herself
That will be a hold on him.”
“A bad hold, if that be all, Sarah. There is a better—
he is a learned man, and a scholar. Scholars are naturally
domestic, and make good husbands.”
“But you know he must be a Papist!” said Mrs.
Fielden.

“Umph!” muttered the vicar, irresolutely.
While the worthy couple were thus conversing, Susan
and her lover, not having finished their conference, had
turned back through the winding walk.
“Indeed,” said William, drawing her arm closer to his
side, “these scruples—these fears—are cruel to me as well
as to yourself. If you were no longer existing, I could be
nothing to your sister. Nay, even were she not married,
you must know enough of her pride to be assured that I
can retain no place in her affections. What has chanced
was not our crime. Perhaps Heaven designed to save, not
only us, but herself, from the certain misery of nuptials so
inauspicious!”
“If she would but answer one of my letters!” sighed
Susan; “or if I could but know that she were happy and
contented 1"
“Your letters must have miscarried—you are not sure
even of her address. Rely upon it she is happy. Do you
think that she would, a second time, “have stooped beneath
her’”—Mainwaring's lip writhed as he repeated that phrase
—“if her feelings had not been involved? I would not
wrong your sister—I shall ever feel gratitude for the past
and remorse for my own shameful weakness—still I must
think that the nature of her attachment to me was more
ardent than lasting.”
“Ah, William how can you know her heart?”
“By comparing it with yours. Oh, there, indeed, I may
anchor my faith ! Susan, we were formed for each other.
Our natures are alike—save that yours, despite its sur-

passing sweetness, has greater strength in its simple candor.
You will be my guide to good. Without you I should
have no aim in life—no courage to front the contests of
this world. Ah, this hand trembles still !”
“William, William, I cannot repress a foreboding—a
superstition 1 At night, I am haunted with that pale face,
as I saw it last,-pale with suppressed despair. Oh, if
ever Lucretia could have need of us—need of our services,
our affections—if we could but repair the grief we have
caused her 1"
Susan's head sank on her lover's shoulder. She had
said “need of us.”—“need of our services.” In those
simple monosyllables the union was pledged—the identity
of their lots in the dark urn was implied.
From this scene turn again—the slide shifts in the
lantern—we are at Paris. In the ante-chamber at the
Tuileries, a crowd of expectant courtiers and adventurers
gaze upon a figure who passes with modest and downcast
eyes through the throng; he has just left the closet of the
First Consul.
“Par Dieu!” said B–, “power, like misery, makes
us acquainted with strange bedfellows. I should like to
hear what the First Consº can have to say to Olivier
Dalibard.”
Fouché, who at that period was scheming for the return
to his old dignities as minister of police, smiled slightly,
and answered, “In a time when the air is filled with dag.
gers, one who was familiar with Robespierre has his uses

Olivier Dalibard is a remarkable man. He is one of those
children of the Revolution, whom that great mother is
bound to save.” "
“By betraying his brethren?” said B–, dryly.
“I do not allow the inference. The simple fact is that
Dalibard has spent many years in England—he has married
an Englishwoman of birth and connections—he knows well
the English language and English people—and just now,
when the First Consul is so anxious to approfondir the
popular feelings of that strange nation, with whose govern-
ment he is compelled to go to war, he may naturally have
much to say to so acute an observer as Olivier Dali-
bard.”
“Um 1" said B–; “with such patronage, Robe-
spierre's friend should hold his head somewhat higher "
Meanwhile, Olivier Dalibard, crossing the gardens of
the palace, took his way to the Faubourg St. Germain.
There was no change in the aspect of this man; the same
meditative tranquillity characterized his downward eyes and
bended brow; the same precise simplicity of dress which
had pleased the prim taste of Robespierre, gave decorum
to his slender stooping form. No expression more cheerful,
no footstep more elastic, bespoke the exile's return to his
native land, or the sanguine expectations of Intellect re-
stored to a career. Yet, to all appearance, the prospects
of Dalibard were bright and promising. The First Consul
was at that stage of his greatness when he sought to em-
ploy in his service all such talent as the Revolution had
made manifest—provided only, that it was not stained

with notorious bloodshed, or too strongly associated with
the Jacobin clubs. His quick eye seemed to have dis-
covered already the abilities of Dalibard, and to have ap-
preciated the sagacity and knowledge of men which had
enabled this subtle person to obtain the friendship of
Robespierre without sharing in his crimes. He had been
frequently closeted with Bonaparte; he was in the de-
clared favor of Fouché, who, though not at that period at
the head of the police, was too necessary amid the dangers
of the time, deepened as they were by the rumors of some
terrible and profound conspiracy, to be laid aside, as the
First Consul had at one moment designed. One man
alone, of those high in the State, appeared to distrust
Olivier Dalibard—the celebrated Cambacéres. But with
his aid the Provençal could dispense. What was the
secret of Dalibard's power? was it, in truth, owing solely
to his native talent, and his acquired experience, especially
of England?—was it by honorable means that he had won
the ear of the First Consul? We may be sure of the con-
trary; for it is a striking attribute of men once thoroughly
tainted by the indulgence of vicious schemes and strata-
gems, that they become wholly blinded to those plain paths
of ambition which common sense makes manifest to ordi-
nary ability. If we regard narrowly the lives of great
criminals, we are often very much startled by the extraor-
dinary acuteness—the profound calculation—the patient
meditative energy which they have employed upon the
conception and execution of a crime. We feel inclined to
think that such intellectual power would have commanded

great distinction, worthily used and guided; but we never
find that these great criminals seem to have been sensible
of the opportunities to real eminence which they have
thrown away. Often we observe that there have been
before them vistas into worldly greatness, which, by no
uncommon prudence and exertion, would have conducted
honest men, half as clever, to fame and power; but, with
a strange obliquity of vision, they appear to have looked
from these broad clear avenues into some dark, tangled
defile, in which, by the subtlest ingenuity, and through the
most besetting perils, they might attain at last to the suc-
cess of a fraud, or the enjoyment of a vice. In crime once
indulged, there is a wonderful fascination—and the fasci-
nation is, not rarely, great in proportion to the intellect
of the criminal. There is always hope of reform for a
dull, uneducated, stolid man, led by accident or temptation
into guilt; but where a man of great ability, and highly
educated, besots himself in the intoxication of dark and
terrible excitements, takes impure delight in tortuous and
slimy ways, the good angel abandons him forever.
Olivier Dalibard walked musingly on—gained a house
in one of the most desolate quarters of the abandoned
Faubourg, mounted the spacious stairs, and rang at the
door of an attic next the roof. After some moments, the
door was slowly and cautiously opened, and two small
fierce eyes, peering through a mass of black, tangled curls,
gleamed through the aperture. The gaze seemed satis-
factory.
“Enter, friend,” said the inmate, with a sort of com-

placent grunt; and, as Dalibard obeyed, the man reclosed
and barred the door.
The room was bare to beggary, the ceiling, low and
sloping, was blackened with smoke. A wretched bed, two
chairs, a table, a strong chest, a small cracked looking-
glass, completed the inventory. The dress of the occupier
was not in keeping with the chamber;—true that it was
not such as was worn by the wealthier classes, but it be-
tokened no sign of poverty. A blue coat, with high col-
lar, and half of military fashion, was buttoned tight over
a chest of vast girth; the nether garments were of leather,
scrupulously clean, and solid, heavy riding boots came half
way up the thigh. A more sturdy, stalwart, strong-built
knave, never excited the admiration which physical power
always has a right to command. And Dalibard gazed on
him with envy. The pale scholar absolutely sighed as he
thought—what an auxiliary to his own scheming mind
would have been so tough a frame !
But even less in form than face did the man of thews
and sinews contrast the man of wile and craft. Opposite
that high forehead, with its massive development of organs,
scowled the low front of one to whom thought was unfa-
miliar—protuberant, indeed, over the shaggy brows, where
phrenologists place the seats of practical perception—
strongly marked in some of the brutes, as in the dog—but
almost literally void of those higher organs, by which we
reason, and imagine, and construct. But in rich atone-
ment for such deficiency, all the animal reigned triumphant
in the immense mass and width of the skull behind. And

as the hair, long before, curled in close rings to the nape
of the bull-like neck, you saw before you one of those use-
ful instruments to ambition and fraud, which recoil at no
danger, comprehend no crime, are not without certain
good qualities, under virtuous guidance,—for they have
the fidelity, the obedience, the stubborn courage of the
animal; but which, under evil control, turn those very
qualities to unsparing evil—bull-dogs to rend the foe, as
bull-dogs to defend the master.
For some moments the two men gazed silently at each
other. At length, Dalibard said, with an air of calm
superiority:
“My friend, it is time that I should be presented to the
chiefs of your party!”
“Chiefs, par tous les diables!” growled the other; “we
Chouans are all chiefs, when it comes to blows. You have
seen my credentials; you know that I am a man to be
trusted; what more do you need 7”
“For myself, nothing; but my friends are more scrupu-
lous. I have sounded, as I promised, the heads of the old
Jacobin party — and they are favorable. This upstart
soldier, who has suddenly seized in his iron grasp all the
fruits of the Revolution, is as hateful to them as to you.
But, que woulez vous, mon cher—men are men l It is one
thing to destroy Bonaparte; it is another thing to restore
the Bourbons. How can the Jacobin chiefs depend on
your assurance, or my own, that the Bourbons will forget
the old offenses, and reward the new service? You ap-
prise me, so do your credentials, that a prince of the blood

is engaged in this enterprise, that he will appear at the
proper season. Put me in direct communication with this
representative of the Bourbons, and I promise in return,
if his assurances are satisfactory, that you shall have an
émeute to be felt from Paris to Marseilles. If you cannot
do this, I am useless; and I withdraw 17
“Withdraw I Garde a vous—Monsieur le Savant / No
man withdraws alive from a conspiracy like ours.”
We have said before that Olivier Dalibard was not
physically brave; and the look of the Chouan, as those
words were said, would have frozen the blood of many a
bolder man. But the habitual hypocrisy of Dalibard en-
abled him to disguise his fear, and he replied, dryly:
“Monsieur le Chouan, it is not by threats that you
will gain adherents to a desperate cause, which, on the
contrary, requires mild words and flattering inducements.
If you commit a violence—a murder—mon cher—Paris is
not Bretagne; we have a police; you will be discovered.”
“Ha, ha!—what then?—do you think I fear the guillo-
tine 7”
“For yourself—no; but for your leaders—yes! If you
are diseovered, and arrested for crime, do you fancy that
the police will not recognize the right arm of the terrible
George Cadoudal 7–that they will not guess that Cadoudal
is at Paris?—that Cadoudal will not accompany you to the
guillotine?”
The Chouan's face fell. Olivier watched him, and pur-
sued his advantage.
“I asked you to introduce to me this shadow of a

prince, under which you would march to a counter-revolu-
tion. But I will be more easily contented. Present me
to George Cadoudal, the hero of Morbihan; he is a man
in whom I can trust, and with whom I can deal. What!
—you hesitate 7—How do you suppose enterprises of this
nature can be carried on ? If, from fear and distrust of
each other, the man you would employ cannot meet the
chief who directs him, there will be delay—confusion—
panic,-and you will all perish by the executioner. And
for me, Pierre Guillot, consider my position: I am in some
favor with the First Consul—I have a station of respecta-
bility—a career lies before me. Can you think that I will
hazard these, with my head to boot, like a rash child?
Do you suppose that, in entering into this terrible contest,
I would consent to treat only with subordinates? Do not
deceive yourself. Again, I say, tell your employers that
they must confer with me directly, or je m'en lave les
mains.”
“I will repeat what you say,” answered Guillot, sullenly
“Is this all 7”
“All for the present,” said Dalibard, slowly drawing on
his gloves, and retreating toward the door. The Chouan
watched him with a suspicious and sinister eye; and as
the Provençal's hand was on the latch, he laid his own
rough grasp on Dalibard's shoulder:
“I know not how it is, Monsieur Dalibard, but I mis-
trust you.” -
“Distrust is natural and prudent to all who conspire,”
replied the scholar, quietly. “I do not ask you to-con-

fide in me—your employers bade you seek me—I have
mentioned my conditions—let them decide.”
“You carry it off well, Monsieur Dalibard. And I am
under a solemn oath, which poor George made me take,
knowing me to be a hot-headed, honest fellow—mauvaise
tête, if you will—that I will keep my hand off pistol and
knife upon mere suspicion—that nothing less than his word
or than clear and positive proof of treachery shall put me
out of good humor and into warm blood. But bear this
with you, Monsieur Dalibard; if I once discover that you
use our secrets to betray them,-should George see you,
and one hair of his head come to injury through your
hands, I will wring your neck as a housewife wrings a
pullet's.”
“I don't doubt your strength or your ferocity, Pierre
Guillot; but my neck will be safe; you have enough to do
to take care of your own—au revoir.”
With a tone and look of calm and fearless irony, the
scholar thus spoke and left the room; but when he was on
the stairs, he paused, and caught at the balustrade—the
sickness as of terror at some danger past, or to be, came
over him; and this contrast between the self-command, or
simulation which belongs to moral courage, and the feeble-
ness of natural and constitutional cowardice, would have
been sublime if shown in a noble cause. In one so cor-
rupt, it but betrayed a nature doubly formidable; for
treachery and murder hatch their brood amid the folds of
a hypocrite's cowardice.
While thus the interview between Dalibard and the con-

spirator, we must bestow a glance upon the Provençal's
home.
In an apartment in one of the principal streets, between
the Boulevards and the Rue St. Honoré, a boy and a
woman sate side by side, conversing in whispers. The
boy was Gabriel Warney, the woman Lucretia Dalibard.
The apartment was furnished in the then modern taste
which affected classical forms; and though, not without a
certain elegance, had something meager and comfortless in
its splendid tripods and thin-legged chairs. There was in
the apartment that air which bespeaks the struggle for
appearances—that struggle familiar with those of limited
income, and vain aspirings, who want the taste which
smoothes all inequalities and gives a smile to home—that
taste which affection seems to prompt, if not to create—
which shows itself in a thousand nameless, costless trifles,
each a grace. No sign was there of the household cares
or industry of women. No flowers, no music, no embroid-
ery-frame, no work-table. Lucretia had none of the sweet
feminine habits which betray so lovelily the whereabout of
women. All was formal and precise, like rooms which we
enter and leave—not those in which we settle and dwell.
Lucretia herself is changed; her air is more assured, her
complexion more pale, the evil character of her mouth
more firm and pronounced.
Gabriel, still a mere boy in years, has a premature look
of man. The down shades his lips. His dress, though
showy and theatrical, is no longer that of boyhood. His
rounded cheek has grown thin, as with the care and

thought which beset the anxious step of youth on enter-
ing into life.
Both, as before remarked, spoke in whispers; both from
time to time glanced fearfully at the door; both felt that
they belonged to a hearth round which smile not the jocund
graces of trust and love, and the heart's open ease.
“But,” said Gabriel—“but if you would be safe, my
father must have no secrets hid from you.”
“I do not know that he has. He speaks to me frankly
of his hopes—of the share he has in the discovery of the
plot against the First Consul—of his interviews with
Pierre Guillot, the Breton.”
“Ah, because there your courage supports him, and
your acuteness assists his own. Such secrets belong to
his public life—his political schemes—with those he will
trust you. It is his private life—his private projects you
must know.”
“But what does he conceal from me? Apart from poli-
tics, his whole mind seems bent on the very natural object
of securing the intimacy with his rich cousin, Monsieur
Bellanger, from whom he has a right to expect so large an
inheritance.”
“Bellanger is rich, but he is not much older than my
father.”
“He has bad health.”
“No,” said Gabriel, with a downcast eye and a strange
smile—“he has not bad health, but he may not be long
lived.”
“How do you mean?” asked Lucretia, sinking her voice

into a still lower whisper, while a shudder, she scarce knew
why, passed over her frame. -
“What does my father do,” resumed Gabriel, “in tha
room at the top of the house? Does he tell you that
secret?”
“He makes experiments in chemistry. You know that
that was always his favorite study. You smile again l
Gabriel, do not smile so; it appalls me. Do you think
there is some mystery in that chamber 7”
“It matters not what we think, belle mêre—it matters
much what we know. If I were you, I would know what
is in that chamber. I repeat, to be safe, you must have
all his secrets or none. Hush, that is his step !”
The door handle turned noiselessly, and Olivier en-
tered. His look fell on his son's face, which betrayed
only apparent surprise at his unexpected return. He
then glanced at Lucretia's, which was, as usual, cold and
impenetrable.
“Gabriel,” said Dalibard, gently, “I have come in for
you. I have promised to take you to spend the day at
Monsieur Bellanger's; you are a great favorite with
Madame. Come, my boy. I shall be back soon, Lucre-
tia. I shall but drop in to leave Gabriel at my cousin's.”
Gabriel rose cheerfully, as if only alive to the expecta-
tion of the bon-bons and compliments he received habit-
ually from Madame Bellanger.
“And you can take your drawing implements with you,”
continued Dalibard. “This good Monsieur Bellanger has
given you permission to copy his Poussin.”


## p. 253 (#259) ############################################

LU CRETIA. 253
“His Poussin Ah, that is placed in his bed-room,” is
it not?"
“Yes,” answered Dalibard, briefly.
Gabriel lifted his sharp bright eyes to his father's face.
Dalibard turned away.
“Come!” he said, with some impatience; and the boy
took up his hat.
In another minute, Lucretia was alone.
Alone, in an English home, is a word implying no
dreary solitude to an accomplished woman; but alone in
that foreign land—alone in those half-furnished, desolate
apartments—few books, no musical instruments—no com-
panions during the day to drop in ;-that loneliness was
wearing. And that mind so morbidly active In the old
Scottish legend, the Spirit that serves the wizard must be
kept constantly employed; suspend its work for a moment,
and it rends the enchanter. It is so with minds that crave
for excitement, and live, without relief of heart and affec-
tion, on the hard tasks of the intellect.
Lucretia mused over Gabriel's words and warning:
“To be safe, you must know all his secrets or none.”
What was the secret which Dalibard had not communi-
cated to her?
She rose, stole up the cold, cheerless stairs, and ascended
to the attic which Dalibard had lately hired. It was
locked; and she observed that the lock was small—so
* It is scarcely necessary to observe that bed-chambers in Paris,
when forming part of the suite of reception rooms, are often deo-

adjoined the sitting-room. All the books which the house
contained were there; a few works on metaphysics—

She took out one of the volumes that seemed less arid than
the rest, for she was weary of her own thoughts, and began
to read. To her surprise, the first passage she opened was
singularly interesting, though the title was nothing more
seductive than the “Life of a Physician at Padua, in the
Sixteenth Century.” It related to that singular epoch of
terror in Italy, when some mysterious disease, varying in a
thousand symptoms, baffled all remedy, and long defied all
conjecture—a disease attacking chiefly the heads of fami-
lies, father and husband—rarely women. In one city,
seven hundred husbands perished, but not one wife The
disease was poison. The hero of the memoir was one of
the earlier discoverers of the true cause of this household
epidemic. He had been a chief authority in a commission
of inquiry. Startling were the details given in the work;
the anecdotes, the histories, the astonishing craft brought
daily to bear on the victim, the wondrous perfidy of the
subtle means, the variation of the certain murder—here

swift as epilepsy—there slow and wasting as long decline:
—the lecture was absorbing; and absorbed in the book
Lucretia still was, when she heard Dalibard's voice behind;
he was looking over her shoulder.
“A strange selection for so fair a student! Enfant, play
not with such weapons?”
“But is this all true?”
“True, though scarce a fragment of the truth. The
physician was a sorry chemist, and a worse philosopher.
He blundered in his analysis of the means; and, if I re-
member rightly, he whines like a priest at the motives; for
see you not what was really the cause of this spreading
pestilence? It was the Saturnalia of the Weak—a burst
of mocking license against the Strong : it was more—it
was the innate force of the individual waging war against

There was a horrible enthusiasm about this reasoning
devil as he spoke thus; his crest rose, his breast expanded.
That animation which a noble thought gives to generous
hearts, kindled in the face of the apologist for the darkest
and basest of human crimes. Lucretia shuddered; but
her gloomy imagination was spelled; there was an interest
mingled with her terror.
“Hush | you appall me,” she said, at last, timidly.
“But, happily, this fearful art exists no more to tempt
and destroy 7”
“As a mere philosophical discovery, it might be amus-
ing to a chemist to learn exactly what were the compounds
of those ancient poisons,” said Dalibard, not directly answer-
ing the implied question. “Portions of the art are indeed

possible suspicion—is it credible? What say you? An

He wishes to let his hotel. Why, Lucretia, if we
knew a little of this old art, par Dieu / we could soon
hire the hotel! Well, well, perhaps we may survive my
cousin, Jean Bellanger!”
Three days afterward, Lucretia stood by her husband's
side in the secret chamber. From the hour when she left
it, a change was perceptible in her countenance, which
gradually removed from it the character of youth. Paler
the cheek could scarce become, nor more cold the discon-
tented, restless eye. But it was as if some great care had
settled on her brow, and contracted yet more the stern
outline of the lips. Gabriel noted the alteration; but he
did not attempt to win her confidence. He was occupied
rather in considering, first, if it were well for him to sound
deeper into the mystery he suspected; and, secondly, to
what extent, and on what terms, it became his interest to
aid the designs in which, by Dalibard's hints and kindly
treatment, he foresaw that he was meant to participate.
A word now on the rich kinsman of the Dalibards: Jean
Bellanger had been one of those prudent republicans who
had put the Revolution to profit. By birth a Marseillais,
—he had settled in Paris, as an épicier, about the year
1785, and had distinguished himself by the adaptability and

finesse which become those who fish in such troubled waters.
He had sided with Mirabeau, next with Vergniaud, and the
Girondins. These he forsook in time for Danton, whose
facile corruptibility made him a seductive patron. He was
a large purchaser in the sale of the emigrant property; he
obtained a contract for the supply of the army in the
Netherlands; he abandoned Danton as he had abandoned
the Girondins, but without taking any active part in the
after proceedings of the Jacobins. His next connection
was with Tallien and Barras, and he enriched himself yet
more under the Directory than he had done in the earlier
stages of the Revolution. Under cover of an appearance
of bonhomie and good humor, a frank laugh and open
countenance, Jean Bellanger had always retained general
popularity and good will; and was one of those whom the
policy of the First Consul led him to conciliate. He had
long since retired from the more vulgar departments of
trade, but continued to flourish as an army contractor. He
had a large hotel and a splendid establishment. He was
one of the great capitalists of Paris. The relationship
between Dalibard and Bellanger was not very close, it was
that of cousins twice removed; and during Dalibard's pre-
vious residence at Paris, each embracing different parties,
and each eager in his career, the blood-tie between them
had not been much thought of, though they were good
friends, and each respected the other for the discretion
with which he had kept aloof from the more sanguinary
excesses of the time. As Bellanger was not many years
older than Dalibard, as the former had but just married in

were unconfirmed, and as some nearer relations stood be.
tween them, in the shape of two promising sturdy nephews,
Dalibard had not then calculated on any inheritance from
his cousin. On his return, circumstances were widely
altered—Bellanger had been married some years, and no
issue had blessed his nuptials. His nephews, draughted
into the conscription, had perished in Egypt. Dalibard
apparently became his nearest relative.
To avarice or to worldly ambition there was, undoubt-
edly, something very dazzling in the prospect thus opened
to the eyes of Olivier Dalibard. The contractor's splendid
mode of living, vying with that of the fermier-général of
old, the colossal masses of capital, by which he backed
and supported speculations that varied with an ingenuity
rendered practical and profound by experience, inflamed
into fever the morbid restlessness of fancy and intellect
which characterized the evil scholar. For that restless-
ness seemed to supply to his nature vices not constitu-
tional to it. Dalibard had not the avarice that belongs
either to a miser or a spendthrift. In his youth, his books
and the simple desires of an abstract student sufficed to his
wants, and a habit of method and order, a mechanical cal-
culation which accompanied all his acts, from the least to
the greatest—preserved him, even when most poor, from
neediness and want. Nor was he by nature vain and os-
tentatious—those infirmities accompany a larger and more
luxuriant nature. His philosophy rather despised, than

inclined to show. Yet since to plot and to scheme made
his sole amusement, his absorbing excitement, so a man
wrapped in himself, and with no generous ends in view,
has little to plot or to scheme for, but objects of worldly
aggrandizement. In this, Dalibard resembled one whom
the intoxication of gambling has mastered, who neither
wants, nor greatly prizes, the stake, but who has grown
wedded to the venture for it. It was a madness like that
of a certain rich nobleman in our own country, who, with
more money than he could spend, and with a skill, in all
games where skill enters, that would have secured him suc-
cess of itself—having learned the art of cheating, could
not resist its indulgence. No hazard, no warning, could
restrain him—cheat he must—the propensity became iron-
strong as a Greek destiny.
That the possible chance of an inheritance so magnifi-
cent should dazzle Lucretia and Gabriel, was yet more
natural; for in them it appealed to more direct and elo-
quent, though not more powerful, propensities. Gabriel
had every vice which the greed of gain most irritates and
excites. Intense covetousness lay at the core of his heart;
he had the sensual temperament which yearns for every
enjoyment, and takes pleasure in every pomp and show of
life. Lucretia, with a hardness of mind that disdained
luxury, and a certain grandeur (if such a word may be
applied to one so perverted) that was incompatible with
the sordid infirmities of the miser, had a determined and
insatiable ambition to which gold was a necessary instru-
ment. Wedded to one she loved, like Mainwaring, the

ambition, as we have said in a former chapter, could have
lived in another, and become devoted to intellectual efforts,
in the nobler desire for power based on fame and genius.
But now she had the gloomy cravings of one fallen, and
the uneasy desire to restore herself to a lost position—she
fed as an aliment upon scorn to bitterness, of all beings
and all things around her. She was gnawed by that false
fever which riots in those who seek by outward seemings
and distinctions to console themselves for the want of their
own self-esteem; or who, despising the world with which
they are brought in contact, sigh for those worldly ad-
vantages, which alone justify to the world itself their
contempt. -
To these diseased infirmities of vanity or pride, whether
exhibited in Gabriel or Lucretia, Dalibard administered
without apparent effort, not only by his conversation, but
his habits of life. He mixed with those much wealthier
than himself, but not better born—those who, in the hot
and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into
new aristocracy, fortunate soldiers, daring speculators,
plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in
the Great Storm. Every one about them was actuated by
the keen desire “to make a fortune”—the desire was con-
tagious. They were not absolutely poor in the proper
sense of the word poverty, with Dalibard's annuity and the
interest of Lucretia's fortune, but they were poor com-
pared to those with whom they associated—poor enough
for discontent. Thus, the image of the mighty wealth from -
which, perhaps, but a single life divided them, became hor-

ribly haunting. To Gabriel's sensual vision, the image pre-
sented itself in the shape of unlimited pleasure and prodigal
riot; to Lucretia, it were the solemn majesty of power;
to Dalibard himself, it was but the Eureka of a calculation
—the palpable reward of wile, and scheme, and dextrous
combinations. The devil had temptations suited to each.
Meanwhile, the Dalibards were more and more with the
Bellangers. Olivier glided in to talk of the chances and
changes of the state and the market. Lucretia sate for
hours, listening mutely to the contractor's boasts of past
frauds, or submitting to the martyrdom of his victorious
games at tric-trac. Gabriel, a spoiled darling, copied the
pictures on the walls, complimented Madame, flattered Mon-
sieur, and fawned on both for trinkets and crowns. Like
three birds of night and omen, these three evil natures
settled on the rich man's roof.
Was the rich man himself blind to the motives which
budded forth into such attentive affection His penetra-
tion was too acute—his ill opinion of mankind too strong,
perhaps, for such amiable self-delusions. But he took all
in good part, availed himself of Dalibard's hints and sug-
gestions as to the employment of his capital; was polite
to Lucretia, and readily condemned her to be beaten at
tric-trac, while he accepted with bonhomie Gabriel's spirited
copies of his pictures. But at times there was a gleam of
satire and malice in his round gray eyes, and an inward
chuckle at the caresses and flatteries he received, which
perplexed Dalibard, and humbled Lucretia. Had his
wealth been wholly at his own disposal, these signs would

have been inauspicious, but the new law was strict, and
the bulk of Bellanger's property could not be alienated
from his nearest kin. was not Dalibard the nearest?
These hopes and speculations did not, as we have seen,
absorb the restless and rank energies of Dalibard's crooked,
but capacious and grasping intellect. Patiently and in-
geniously he pursued his main political object—the detec-
tion of that audacious and complicated conspiracy against
the First Consul, which ended in the tragic deaths of
Pichegru, the Duc d'Enghien, and the erring but illus-
trious hero of La Vendée, George Cadoudal. In the
midst of these dark plots for personal aggrandizement
and political fortune, we leave, for the moment, the somber
sullen soul of Olivier Dalibard.

ish and down-eyed—he has come not to invest, but to bor-
row. What matters, war is breaking out anew, to bring
the time of high prices, and paper money, and credit.
Honest yeoman, you will not be refused. He scratches
his rough head, pulls a leg, as he calls it, when the clerk
leans over the counter, and asks to see “Muster Mawner-
ing hisself.” The clerk points to the little office-room of
the new junior partner, who has brought ten thousand
pounds, and a clear head, to the firm. And the yeoman's
great boots creak heavily in. I told you so, honest yeo-
man; you come out with a smile on your brown face, and
your hand, that might fell an ox, buttons up your huge
breeches-pocket. You will ride home with a light heart—
go and dine, and be merry.
The yeoman tramps to the Ordinary; plates clatter,
tongues wag; and the borrower's full heart finds vent in a
good word for that kind “Muster Mawnering.” For a
wonder, all join in the praise. “He’s an honor to the
town; he's a pride to the country—thof he's such a friend

them blood-thirsty Mounseers If their members were

The day declines; the town empties—whiskies, horses,

The conspiracy against the life of the First Consul has
been detected and defeated. Pichegru is in prison, George
Cadoudal awaits his trial, the Duc d'Enghien sleeps in his
bloody grave; the imperial crown is prepared for the
great soldier, and the great soldier's creatures bask in the
noonday sun. Olivier Dalibard is in high and lucrative
employment: his rise is ascribed to his talents—his opin-
ions. No service connected with the detection of the con-
spiracy is traced or traceable by the public eye. If such
exist, it is known but to those who have no desire to reveal
it. The old apartments are retained; but they are no
longer dreary, and comfortless, and deserted. They are
gay with draperies, and or-molu, and mirrors; and Madame
Dalibard has her nights of reception, and Monsieur Dali-
bard has already his troops of clients. In that gigantic

bard learns that the dead man had a son—a son by a for.
mer marriage—the marriage undeclared, unknown, amid
the riot of the Revolution; for the wife was the daughter
of a proscrit. The son had been reared at a distance,
put to school at Lyons, and unavowed to the second wife,
who had brought an ample dower, and whom that dis-
covery might have deterred from the altar. Unacknowl-
edged through life—in death, at least, the son's rights are
proclaimed: and Olivier Dalibard feels that Jean Bellan-
ger has died in vain For days has the pale Provençal
been closeted with lawyers; but there is no hope in litiga-
tion. The proofs of the marriage, the birth, the identity,
come out clear and clearer; and the beardless schoolboy
at Lyons reaps all the profit of those nameless schemes
and that mysterious death. Olivier Dalibard desires the
friendship—the intimacy of the heir. But the heir is con-
signed to the guardianship of a merchant at Lyons, near
of kin to his mother—and the guardian responds but
coldly to Olivier's letters. Suddenly the defeated aspirant
seems reconciled to his loss. The widow Bellanger has
her own separate fortune; and it is large, beyond expec-
tation. In addition to the wealth she brought the de-
ceased, his affection had led him to invest vast sums in her
name. The widow, then, is rich—rich as the heir himself.

An avenger lived; and Olivier Dalibard started at his own
shadow on the wall. But he did not the less continue to
plot and to intrigue—nay, such occupation became more
necessary, as an escape from himself.
And, in the mean while, Olivier Dalibard sought to take
courage from the recollection that the Chouan had taken
an oath (and he knew that oaths are held sacred with the
Bretons) that he would keep his hand from his knife, un-
less he had clear evidence of treachery;—such evidence
existed, but only in Dalibard's desk, or the archives of
Fouché. Tush, he was safe! And so, when from dreams
of fear he started at the depth of night, so his bolder wife
would whisper to him with firm uncaressing lips: “Olivier
Dalibard, thou fearest the living, dost thou never fear the
dead? Thy dreams are haunted with a specter. Why
takes it not the accusing shape of thy mouldering kins-
man?” Dalibard would have answered, for he was a phi-
losopher in his cowardice: “Il n'y a que les morts, qui me
reviennent pas.”

bard; for he rarely communed with himself; a sort of
mental calculation, it is true, eternally went on within him,
like the wheels of a destiny; but it had become a mechan-
ical operation—seldom disturbed by that consciousness of
thought, with its struggles of fear and doubt, conscience
and crime, which gives its appalling interest to the solilo-
quy of tragedy, Amid the tremendous secrecy of that
profound intellect, as at the bottom of a sea, only mon-
strous images of terror, things of prey, stirred in cold-
blooded and devouring life; but into these deeps Olivier
himself did not dive. He did not face his own soul; his
outer life and his inner life seemed separate individualties,
just as, in some complicated state, the social machine goes
on through all its numberless cycles of vice and dread,
whatever the acts of the government, which is the repre-
sentative of the state, and stands for the state in the shal-
low judgment of history.
Before this time Olivier Dalibard's manner to his son
had greatly changed from the indifference it betrayed in
England: it was kind and affectionate, almost caressing;
while on the other hand, Gabriel, as if in possession of
some secret which gave him power over his father, took a
more careless and independent tone, often absented him-
self from the house for days together, joined the revels of

formed acquaintance, indulged in spendthrift expenses.
and plunged prematurely into the stream of vicious pleas-
ure that oozed through the mud of Paris.
One morning, Dalibard, returning from a visit to
Madame Bellanger, found Gabriel alone in the salon,
contemplating his fair face and gay dress in one of the
mirrors, and smoothing down the hair, which he wore long
and sleek, as in the portraits of Raffaelle. Dalibard's
lip curled at the boy's coxcombry, though such tastes he
himself had fostered, according to his ruling principles,
that to govern, you must find a foible, or instill it; but the
sneer changed into a smile.
- “Are you satisfied with yourself, joli garçon?” he said,
with saturnine playfulness.
“At least, sir, I hope that you will not be ashamed of
me when you formally legitimatize me as your son. The
time has come, you know, to keep your promise.”
“And it shall be kept, do not fear. But first, I have
an employment for you—a mission—your first embassy,
Gabriel.”
“I listen, sir.”
“I have to send to England a communication of the
utmost importance—public importance—to the secret
agent of the French government. We are on the eve of a
descent on England. We are in correspondence with some
in London on whom we count for support. A man might
be suspected and searched—mind, searched. You, a boy,
with English name and speech, will be my safest envoy.

Despite the calm tone of the father, so had the son, from
the instinct of fear and self-preservation, studied every
accent, every glance of Olivier—so had he constituted
himself a spy upon the heart whose perfidy was ever
armed, that he detected at once, in the proposal, some
scheme hostile to his interests. He made, however, no
opposition to the plan suggested; and, seemingly satisfied
with his obedience, the father dismissed him.
As soon as he was in the streets, Gabriel went straight
to the house of Madame Bellanger. The hotel had been
purchased in her name, and she therefore retained it.
Since her husband's death, he had avoided that house,
before so familiar to him; and now he grew pale, and
breathed hard, as he passed by the porter's lodge up the
lofty stairs.
He knew of his father's recent and constant visits at the
house; and, without conjecturing precisely what were
Olivier's designs, he connected them, in the natural and
acquired shrewdness he possessed, with the wealthy widow.
He resolved to watch, observe, and draw his own conclu-
sions. As he entered Madame Bellanger's room rather
abruptly, he observed her push aside among her papers
something she had been gazing on — something which
sparkled to his eyes. He sate himself down close to her
with the caressing manner he usually adopted toward wo-
men; and in the midst of the babbling talk with which

ladies generally honor boys, he suddenly, as if by accident,
displaced the papers, and saw his father's miniature set in
brilliants. The start of the widow, her blush, and her ex-
clamation, strengthened the light that flashed upon his
mind. “O-ho, I see now,” he said, laughing, “why my
father is always praising black hair; and—nay, nay—
gentlemen may admire ladies in Paris, surely 1”
“Pooh, my dear child, your father is an old friend of
my poor husband's, and a near relation too! But, Gabriel,
mon petit ange / you had better not say at home that you
have seen this picture, Madame Dalibard might be foolish
enough to be angry.”
“To be sure not. I have kept a secret before now !”
and again the boy's cheek grew pale, and he looked hur-
riedly round.
“And you are very fond of Madame Dalibard, too, so
you must not vex her.”
“Who says I'm fond of Madame Dalibard?—a step-
mother l’’
“Why, your father, of course—il est si bºn–ce pauvre

she should fret, and with bad health, too.”

likely to live long !”
“So your poor father apprehends. Well, well, how

you now.”
“Adieu, my dear boy—not a word on the miniaturel
By-the-by, here's a shirt-pin for you—tues joli comme un
amour.”
All was now clear to Gabriel—it was necessary to get
rid of him, and forever! Dalibard might dread his at-
tachment to Lucretia—he would dread still more his closer
intimacy with the widow of Bellanger, should that widow
wed again, and Dalibard—freed like her (by what means?)
—be her choicel Into that abyss of wickedness, fathomless
to the innocent, the young villainous eye plunged, and sur-
veyed the ground; a terror seized on him—a terror of life
and death. Would Dalibard spare even his own son, if
that son had the power to injure? This mission—was it
exile only 7–only a fall back to the old squalor of his
uncle's studio?—only the laying aside of a useless tool—
or was it a snare to the grave? Demon as Dalibard was,
doubtless the boy wronged him. But guilt construes guilt
for the worst."
Gabriel had formerly enjoyed the thought to match him-
self, should danger come, with Dalibard; the hour had
come, and he felt his impotence. Brave his father, and
refuse to leave Francel from that even his reckless hardi-
hood shrank as from inevitable destruction. But to de-
part—be the poor victim and dupe; after having been let
loose among the riot of pleasure, to return to labor and
privation—from that option his vanity and his senses win-
dictively revolted. And Lucretia!—the only being who

seemed to have a human kindness to him!—through all
the vicious egotism of his nature, he had some grateful
sentiments for her l—and even the egotism assisted that
unwonted amiability, for he felt that, Lucretia gone, he
had no hold on his father's house—that the home of her
successor never would be his. While thus brooding, he
lifted his eyes and saw Dalibard pass in his carriage
toward the Tuileries. The house, then, was clear—he
could see Lucretia alone. He formed his resolution at once,
and turned homeward. As he did so, he observed a man
at the angle of the street, whose eyes followed Dalibard's
carriage with an expression of unmistakable hate and re-
venge; but scarcely had he marked the countenance, before
the man, looking hurriedly round, darted away and was
lost among the crowd.
Now, that countenance was not quite unfamiliar to
Gabriel. He had seen it before, as he saw it now,-hastily,
and, as it were, by fearful snatches. Once he had marked,
on returning home at twilight, a figure lurking by the house
—and something in the quickness with which it turned
from his gaze, joined to his knowledge of Dalibard's ap-
prehensions, made him mention the circumstance to his
father, when he entered. Dalibard bade him hasten with
a note, written hurriedly, to an agent of the police, whom
he kept lodged near at hand. The man was still on the
threshold when the boy went out on this errand, and he
caught a glimpse of his face; but before the police agent
reached the spot, the ill-omened apparition had vanished.
Gabriel now, as his eye rested full upon that threatening

brow, and those burning eyes, was convinced that he saw
before him the terrible Pierre Guillot, whose very name
blanched his father's cheek. When the figure retreated,
he resolved at once to pursue. He hurried through the
crowd amid which the man had disappeared, and looked
eagerly into the faces of those he jostled—sometimes, at
the distance, he caught sight of a figure which appeared
to resemble the one which he pursued, but the likeness
faded on approach. The chase, however, vague and de-
sultory as it was, led him on till his way was lost among
labyrinths of narrow and unfamiliar streets. Heated and
thirsty, he paused at last before a small café—entered to
ask for a draught of lemonade—and behold, chance had
favored him l—the man he sought was seated there, before
a bottle of wine, and intently reading the newspaper.
Gabriel sat himself down at the adjoining table. In a few
moments the man was joined by a new-comer—the two
conversed, but in whispers so low that Gabriel was unable
to hear their conversation—though he caught more than
once the name of “George.” Both the men were violently
excited, and the expression of their countenances was
menacing and sinister. The first-comer pointed often to
the newspaper, and read passages from it to his com-
panion. This suggested to Gabriel the demand for another
journal. When the waiter brought it to him, his eye
rested upon a long paragraph, in which the name of
George Cadoudal frequently occurred. In fact, all the
journals of the day were filled with speculations on the
conspiracy and trial of that fiery martyr to an erring

adaptation of a noble principle. Gabriel knew that his
father had had a principal share in the detection of the
defeated enterprise; and his previous persuasions were con-
firmed.
His sense of hearing grew sharper by continued effort,
and at length he heard the first-comer say distinctly: “If
I were but sure that I had brought this fate upon George,
by introducing to him that accursed Dalibard—if my oath
did but justify me, I would
;” the concluding sentence
was lost. A few moments after, the two men rose, and
from the familiar words that passed between them and the
master of the café, who approached, himself, to receive
the reckoning, the shrewd boy perceived that the place
was no unaccustomed haunt. He crept nearer and nearer;
and as the landlord shook hands with his customer, he
heard distinctly the former address him by the name of
“Guillot.” When the men withdrew, Gabriel followed
them at a distance (taking care first to impress on his
memory the name of the café, and the street in which it
was placed), and, as he thought, unobserved; he was mis-
taken. Suddenly, in one street, more solitary than the
rest, the man whom he was mainly bent on tracking turned
round—advanced to Gabriel, who was on the other side
of the street, and laid his hand upon him so abruptly that
the boy was fairly taken by surprise.
“Who bade you follow us?” said he, with so dark and
fell an expression of countenance that even Gabriel's
courage failed him: “no evasion—no lies—speak out, and
at once;” and the grasp tightened on the boy's throat.

Gabriel's readiness of resource and presence of mind did
not long forsake him.
“Loose your hold, and I will tell you—you stifle me.”
The man slightly relaxed his grasp, and Gabriel said,
quickly: “My mother perished on the guillotine in the
Reign of Terror; I am for the Bourbons. I thought I
overheard words which showed sympathy for poor George,
the brave Chouan. I followed you; for I thought I was
following friends.”
The man smiled as he fixed his steady eye upon the un-
flinching child: “My poor lad,” he said gently, “I believe
you—pardon me—but follow us no more—we are danger-
ous!” He waved his hand, and strode away, rejoined his
companion, and Gabriel reluctantly abandoned the pursuit
and went homeward. It was long before he reached his
father's house, for he had strayed into a strange quarter of
Paris, and had frequently to inquire the way. At length
he reached home, and ascended the stairs to a small room,
in which Lucretia usually sate, and which was divided by
a narrow corridor from the sleeping chamber of herself
and Dalibard. His stepmother, leaning her cheek upon
her hand, was seated by the window, so absorbed in some
gloomy thoughts, which cast over her rigid face a shade,
intense and solemn as despair, that she did not perceive
the approach of the boy till he threw his arm round her
neck, and then she started as in alarm—
“You ! only you,” she said, with a constrained smile;
“see, my nerves are not so strong as they were !”
“You are disturbed, belle mêre—has he been vexing
you ?”

“He-Dalibard—no, indeed, we were only, this morning,
discussing matters of business.”
“Business l—that means money!”
“Truly,” said Lucretia, “money does make the staple
of life's business. In spite of his new appointment, your
father needs some sums in hand—favors are to be bought
—opportunities for speculation occur, and »
“And my father,” interrupted Gabriel, “wishes your
consent to raise the rest of your portion.”
Lucretia looked surprised, but answered quietly: “He
had my consent long since, but the trustees to the mar-
riage settlement—mere men of business — my uncle's
bankers, for I had lost all claim on my kindred—re-
fuse, or at least interpose such difficulties as amount to
refusal.”
“But that reply came some days since,” said Gabriel,
musingly.
“How did you know—did your father tell you?”
“Poor belle mêre!” said Gabriel, almost with pity,
“can you live in this house, and not watch all that passes
—every stranger, every message, every letter?—But what,
then, does he wish with you?”
“He has suggested my returning to England and seeing
the trustees myself. His interest can obtain my passport.”
“And you have refused?”
“I have not consented.”
“Consent l—hush l—your maid–Marie is not waiting
without,” and Gabriel rose and looked forth; “no, con-
found these doors 1 none close as they ought in this house.

Is it not a clause in your settlement that the half of your
fortune now invested goes to the survivor?”
“It is,” replied Lucretia, struck and thrilled at the
question. “How, again, did you know this?”
“I saw my father reading the copy. If you die first,
then, he has all ! If he merely wanted the money he
would not send you away !”
There was a terrible pause. Gabriel resumed: “I trust
you, it may be, with my life; but I will speak out. My
father goes much to Bellanger's widow—she is rich and
weak. Come to England 1 Yes, come—for he is about
to dismiss me. He fears that I shall be in the way, to
warn you, perhaps, or to–to–in short, both of us are in
his way. He gives you an escape. Once in England, the
war which is breaking out will prevent your return. He
will twist the laws of divorce to his favor—he will marry
again! What then?—he spares you what remains of your
fortune—he spares your life. Remain here—cross his
schemes—and—no, no; —come to England—safer any-
where than here!”
As he spoke, great changes had passed over Lucretia's
countenance. At first it was the flash of conviction, then
the stunned shock of horror; now she rose—rose to her
full height—and there was a livid and deadly light in her
eyes—the light of conscious courage, and power, and re-
venge. “Fool,” she muttered, “with all his craft Fool,
fool! As if, in the war of household perfidy, the woman
did not always conquer! Man's only chance is to be
mailed in honor l’

“But,” said Gabriel, overhearing her, “but you do not
remember what it is. There is nothing you can see, and
guard against. It is not like an enemy face to face; it is
death in the food, in the air, in the touch. You stretch
out your arms in the dark—you feel nothing, and you die!
Oh, do not fancy that I have not thought well (for I am
almost a man now) if there were no means to resist—there
are none I As well make head against the plague—it is
in the atmosphere... Come to England, and return. Live
poorly, if you must—but live—but live!”
“Return to England poor and despised, and bound still
to him, or a disgraced and divorced wife—disgraced by
the low-born dependent on my kinsman's house—and fawn
perhaps upon my sister and her husband for bread Î
Never !—I am at my post, and I will not fly l’
“Bravel bravel” said the boy, clapping his hands, and
sincerely moved by a daring superior to his own; “I wish
I could help you!”
Lucretia's eye rested on him with the full gaze, so rare
in its looks. She drew him to her, and kissed his brow.
“Boy, through life, whatever our guilt and its doom, we
are bound to each other. I may yet live to have wealth
—if so, it is yours as a son's. I may be iron to others—
never to you. Enough of this — I must reflect l” She
passed her hands over her eyes a moment, and resumed:
“You would help me in my self-defense; I think you can.
You have been more alert in your watch than I have.
You must have means I have not secured. Your father
guards well all his papers I”

Without reply, Lucretia took the keys from Gabriel's
half-reluctant hand, and passed into her husband's writing-
room. When she had entered, she locked the door. She
passed at once to a huge secretary, of which the key was
small as a fairy's work. She opened it with ease by one
of the counterfeits. No love correspondence—the first
object of her search, for she was woman—met her eye.
What need of letters, when interviews were so facile ! But
she soon found a document that told all which love-letters
could tell—it was an account of the moneys and posses.

sions of Madame Bellanger—and there were pencil notes
on the margin:—“Vautran will give 400,000 francs for
the lands in Auvergne—to be accepted. Consult on the
power of sale granted to a second husband. Query, if
there is no chance of the heir-at-law disputing the moneys
invested in Madame B.’s name,”—and such memoranda as
a man notes down in the schedule of properties about to
be his own. In these inscriptions there was a hideous
mockery of all love—like the blue lights of corruption,
they showed the black vault of the heart. The pale reader
saw what her own attractions had been, and, fallen as she
was, she smiled superior in her bitterness of scorn. Ar-
ranged methodically with the precision of business, she
found the letters she next looked for; one recognizing
Dalibard's services in the detection of the conspiracy, and
authorizing him to employ the police in the search of
Pierre Guillot, sufficed for her purpose. She withdrew,
and secreted it. She was about to lock up the secretary,
when her eye fell on the title of a small MS. volume in a
corner; and as she read, she pressed one hand convulsively
to her heart, while twice, with the other, she grasped the
volume, and twice withdrew the grasp. The title ran
harmlessly thus:–“Philosophical and chemical inquiries
into the nature and materials of the poisons in use be-
tween the 14th and 16th centuries.” Hurriedly, and āt
last, as if doubtful of herself, she left the MS., closed the
secretary, and returned to Gabriel.
“You have got the paper you seek?” he said.
ti Yes.”

“Then whatever you do, you must be quick—he will
soon discover the loss.”
“I will be quick.”
“It is I whom he will suspect,” said Gabriel, in alarm,
as that thought struck him. “No, for my sake do not
take the letter till I am gone. Do not fear, in the mean
time—he will do nothing against you while I am here.”
“I will replace the letter till then,” said Lucretia,
meekly. “You have a right to my first thoughts.” So
she went back, and Gabriel (suspicious, perhaps) crept
after her. -
As she replaced the document, he pointed to the MS.
which had tempted her—“I have seen that before, how I
..onged for it ! If anything ever happens to him, I claim
that as my legacy.”
Their hands met as he said this, and grasped each other
convulsively; Lucretia relocked the secretary, and when
she gained the next room she tottered to a chair. Her
strong nerves gave way for the moment; she uttered no
cry, but, by the whiteness of her face, Gabriel saw that she
was senseless; senseless for a minute or so—scarcely more.
But the return to consciousness with a clinched hand, and
a brow of defiance, and a stare of mingled desperation and
dismay, seemed rather the awaking from some frightful
dream of violence and struggle than the slow languid re-
covery from the faintness of a swoon. Yes, henceforth, to
sleep was to couch by a serpent—to breathe was to listen
for the avalanche | Thou who didst trifle so wantonly with

Gabriel was strangely moved as he beheld that proud
and solitary despair. An instinct of nature had hitherto
checked him from actively aiding Lucretia in that struggle
with his father, which could but end in the destruction of
one or the other. He had contented himself with fore-
warnings, with hints, with indirect suggestions; but now,
all his sympathy was so strongly roused on her behalf that
the last faint scruple of filial conscience vanished into the
abyss of blood, over which stood that lonely Titaness. He
drew near, and, clasping her hand, said, in a quick and
broken voice:
“Listen! You know where to find proof of my fa—
that is, of Dalibard's treason to the conspirators; you
know the name of the man he dreads as an avenger, and
you know that he waits but the proof to strike; but you
do not know where to find that man, if his revenge is
wanting for yourself. The police has not hunted him out;
how can you? Accident has made me acquainted with one
of his haunts. Give me a single promise, and I will put
you at least upon that clew—weak, perhaps, but as yet the
sole one to be followed. Promise me that, only in defense
of your own life, not for mere jealousy, you will avail
yourself of the knowledge, and you shall know all I do ſ”
“Do you think,” said Lucretia, in a calm, cold voice
“that it is for jealousy, which is love, that I would murder
all hope, all peace? for we have here”—(and she smote her

Son, I will not harm your father except in self-defensel
But tell me nothing that may make the son a party in
the father's doom.”
“The father slew the mother,” muttered Gabriel, be-
tween his clinched teeth; “and to me you have well-nigh
supplied her place. Strike, if need be, in her name ! If
you are driven to want the arm of Pierre Guillot, seek
news of him at the Café Dufour, Rue S , Boulevard
du Temple. Be calm now, I hear your husband's step.”
A few days more, and Gabriel is gone l Wife and hus-
band are alone with each other. Lucretia has refused to
depart. Then that mute coma of horror! that suspense
of two foes in the conflict of death—for the subtle prying
eye of Olivier Dalibard sees that he himself is suspected—
further he shuns from sifting ! Glance fastens on glance,
and then hurries smilingly away. From the cup, grins a
skeleton—at the board, warns a specter. But how kind
still the words, and how gentle the tone; and they lie
down side by side in the marriage bed—brain plotting
against brain, heart loathing heart. It is a duel of life
and death, between those sworn through life and beyond
death at the altar. But it is carried on with all the forms
and courtesies of duel in the age of chivalry. No con-
jugal wrangling—no slip of the tongue;—the oil is on the
surface of the wave—the monsters in the hell of the abyss
war invisibly below. At length, a dull torpor creeps over
the woman—she feels the taint in her veins,—the slow
victory is begun. What mattered all her vigilance and

caution? Wainly glide from the pangs of the serpent, his
very breath suffices to destroy 1 Pure seems the draught
and wholesome the viand—that master of the science of
murder needs not the means of the bungler! Then, keen
and strong from the creeping lethargy started the fierce
instinct of self and the ruthless impulse of revenge. Not
too late yet to escape; for those subtle banes, that are to
defy all detection, work but slowly to their end.
One evening, a woman closely mantled, stood at watch
by the angle of a wall. The light came dim and muffled
from the window of a café hard at hand—the reflection
slept amid the shadows on the dark pavement, and, save a
solitary lamp, swung at distance in the vista over the cen-
ter of the narrow street, no ray broke the gloom. The
night was clouded and starless, the wind moaned in gusts,
and the rain fell heavily; but the gloom and the loneliness
did not appall the eye, and the wind did not chill the heart,
and the rain fell unheeded on the head of the woman at
her post. At times she paused, in her slow, sentry-like
pace to and fro, to look through the window of the café,
and her gaze fell always on one figure seated apart from
the rest. At length, her pulse beat more quickly, and the
patient lips smiled sternly. The figure had risen to de-
part. A man came out, and walked quickly up the street;
the woman approached, and when the man was under the
single lamp swung aloft, he felt his arm touched; the
woman was at his side, and looking steadily into his face:
“You are Pierre Guillot, the Breton, the friend of
George Cadoudal. Will you be his avenger?"

The Chouan's first impulse had been to place his hand
in his vest, and something shone bright in the lamplight,
clasped in those iron fingers. The voice and the manner
reassured him, and he answered readily:

“Read, then, and act,” answered the woman, and she
placed a paper in his hands.

At Laughton the babe is on the breast of the fair

rade; he is pale, and there is terror on his face; and you
may see that the journal in his hand trembles like a leaf.
In the gardens of the Tuileries, some score or so of
gossips group together.
“And no news of the murderer?” asked one.
“No ; but a man who had been friend to Robespierre
must have made secret enemies enough.”
“Ce pauvre Dalibard! He was not mixed up with the
Terrorists, nevertheless.”
“Ah, but the more deadly for that, perhaps—a sly man
was Olivier Dalibard I’’
“What's the matter?” said an employé, lounging up to
the group. “Are you talking of Olivier Dalibard? It is
but the other day he had Marsan's appointment. He is
now to have Pleyel's. I heard it two days ago—a capital

amusements. He was accustomed to spelid part of his
nights there. They found him at morning, bathed in his
blood, with three ghastly wounds in his side, and his fingers
cut to the bone. He had struggled hard with the knife
that butchered him.

spendthrift heirl"
“He has no heir but young Bellanger, who will be riche

nicates with the roof-tops. There the murderer had en-
tered, and by that way escaped, for they found the leads
of the gutter dabbled with blood. The next house was
uninhabited—easy enough to get in there, and lie perdu
till night.”
“Hum,” said the lawyer; “but the assassin could only
have learned Dalibard's habits from some one in the
house. Was the deceased married ?”
“Oh, yes; to an Englishwoman.”
“She had lovers, perhaps?”
“Pooh I lovers 1—the happiest couple ever known

quitted the crowd, abstractedly.

pointed to such tasks by the French law has performed
his visit, and made his notes, and expressed condolence
with the widow, and promised justice and retribution, and
placed his seal on the locks till the representatives of the

Jean Bellanger, the contractor | But Lucretia has ob-
tained beforehand all she wishes to save from the rest.
An open box is on the floor, into which her hand drops
noiselessly a volume in manuscript. On the forefinger of
that hand is a ring, larger and more massive than those
usually worn by women;–by Lucretia never worn before.
Why should that ring have been selected with such care
from the dead man's hoards? Why so precious the dull
opal in that cumbrous setting? From the hand the volume
drops without sound into the box, as those whom the secrets
of the volume instruct you to destroy may drop without noise
into the grave. The trace of some illness, recent and deep,
nor conquered yet, has plowed lines in that young counte-
nance, and dimmed the light of those searching eyes. Yet,

go back to that narrow corridor; disregarded, thrown
aside, are a cloth and a besom; the cloth is wet still; but
here and there, the red stains are dry, and clotted as with
bloody glue; and the hairs of the besom start up, torn and
ragged, as if the bristles had a sense of some horror—as if
things inanimate still partook of men's dread at men's
deeds. If you passed through the corridor, and saw in
the shadow of the wall that homeliest of instrurrents cast
away and forgotten, you would smile at the slatternly
housework. But if you knew that a corpse had been borne
down those stairs to the left—borne along those floors to
that marriage bed, with the blood oozing, and gushing,
and plashing below, as the bearers passed with their
burden, then, straight that dead thing would take the
awe of the dead being; it told its own tale of violence
and murder; it had dabbled in the gore of the violated
clay; it had become an evidence of the crime. No wonder
that its hairs bristled up, sharp and ragged, in the shadow
of the wall!
The first part of the tragedy ends. Let fall the curtain.
When next it rises, years will have passed away, graves
uncounted will have wrought fresh hollows in our merry
sepulcher—sweet earth! Take a sand from the shore,
take a drop from the ocean less than sand-grain, and drop
in man's planet one Death and one Crime! On the map,
trace all oceans, and search out every shore, more than
seas, more than lands, in God's balance shall weigh one
Death and one Crime !

THE century has advanced: the rush of the deluge has
ebbed back, the old landmarks have reappeared; the dy-
nasties Napoleon willed into life have crumbled to the
dust; the plow has passed over Waterloo; autumn after
autumn the harvests have glittered on that grave of an
empire. Through the immense ocean of universal change,
we look back on the single track which our frail boat has
cut through the waste. As a star shines impartially over
the measureless expanse, though it seems to gild but one
broken line to each eye; so, as our memory gazes on the
past, the light spreads not over all the breadth of the
waste, where nations have battled, and argosies gone down
—it falls, narrow and confined, along the single course we
have taken: we lean over the small raft on which we float,
and see the sparkles but reflected from the waves that it
divides.
On the terrace at Laughton, but one step paces slowly.
The bride clings not now to the bridegroom's arm. Though
pale and worn, it is still the same gentle face; but the
blush of woman's love has gone from it evermore.

he is best known to us) sleeps in the vault of the St. Johns.
He had lived longer than he himself had expected, than his
physician had hoped—lived, cheerful and happy, amid quiet
pursuits and innocent excitements. Three sons had blessed
his hearth, to mourn over his grave. But, the two elder
were delicate and sickly. They did not long survive him,
and died within a few months of each other. The third
seemed formed of a different mould and constitution from
his brethren. To him descended the ancient heritage of
Laughton, and he promised to enjoy it long.
It is Vernon's widow who walks alone in the stately
terrace; sad still, for she loved well the choice of her
youth, and she misses yet the children in the grave; from
the date of Vernon's death, she wore mourning without
and within; and the sorrows that came later, broke more
the bruised reed; sad still, but resigned. One son sur-
wives; and earth yet has the troubled hopes and the holy
fears of affection. Though that son be afar, in sport or in
earnest, in pleasure or in toil, working out his destiny as
man, still that step is less solitary than it seems. When does
the son's image not walk beside the mother? Though she
lives in seclusion, though the gay world tempts no more,
the gay world is yet linked to her thoughts. From the
distance she hears its murmurs in music. Her fancy still
mingles with the crowd, and follows one, to her eye, out-
shining all the rest. Never vain in herself, she is vain now
of another; and the small triumphs of the young and
well-born seem trophies of renown to the eyes so tenderly
deceived.

In the old-fashioned market-town still the business goes
on, still the doors of the bank open and close every mo-
ment on the great day of the week; but the names over
the threshold are partially changed. The junior partner
is busy no more at the desk; not wholly forgotten—if his
name still is spoken, it is not with thankfulness and praise.
A something rests on the name—that something which
dims and attaints—not proven, not certain, but suspected
and dubious. The head shakes, the voice whispers,
and the attorney now lives in the solid red house at the
verge of the town.
In the vicarage, Time, the old scythe-bearer, has not
paused from his work. Still employed on Greek texts,
little changed, save that his hair is gray, and that some
lines in his kindly face tell of sorrows as of years, the
vicar sits in his parlor, but the children no longer, blithe-
voiced and rose-cheeked, dart through the rustling espal-
iers. Those children, grave men or staid matrons (save one
whom Death chose, and therefore now of all best beloved 1),
are at their posts in the world. The young ones are flown
from the nest, and, with anxious wings, here and there,
search food in their turn for their young. But the blithe
voice and rose-cheek of the child make not that loss which
the hearth misses the most. From childhood to manhood,
and from manhood to departure, the natural changes are
gradual and prepared. The absence most missed is that
household life which presided, which kept things in order,
and must be coaxed if a chair were displaced. That provi.
dence in trifles, that clasp of small links, that dear, bustling

agency—now pleased, now complaining—dear alike in each
change of its humor; that active life which has no self of
its own;–like the mind of a poet, though its prose be the
humblest, transferring self into others, with its right to be
cross, and its charter to scold;—for the motive is clear—it
takes what it loves too anxiously to heart. The door of
the parlor is open, the garden path still passes before the
threshold; but no step now has full right to halt at the
door and interrupt the grave thought on Greek texts;–
no small talk on details and wise savings chimes in with
the wrath of Medea. The Prudent Genius is gone from
the household; and perhaps as the good scholar now
wearily pauses, and looks out on the silent garden, he
would have given with joy all that Athens produced, from
AEschylus to Plato, to hear again from the old familiar
lips the lament on torn jackets, or the statistical economy
of eggs!
But see, though the wife is no more, though the children
have departed, the vicar's home is not utterly desolate.

that undulating form 1 She smiles—her lips move—she is
conversing with herself—she cannot be all silent, even
when alone; for the sunny gladness of her nature must
have vent like a bird's. But do not fancy that that glad-
ness speaks the levity which comes from the absence of
thought; it is rather from the depth of thought that it
springs, as from the depth of a sea comes its music. See,
while she pauses and listens, with her finger half raised to
her lip, as amid that careless jubilee of birds she hears a
note more grave and sustained, the nightingale singing,
by day—(as sometimes, though rarely, he is heard—per-
haps, because he misses his mate—perhaps, because he sees
from his bower the creeping form of some foe to his race);
—see, as she listens now to that plaintive, low-chanted
warble, how quickly the smile is sobered, how the shade,
soft and pensive, steals over the brow. It is but the mystic
sympathy with Nature that bestows the smile or the shade.
In that heart lightly moved beats the fine sense of the poet.
It is the exquisite sensibility of the nerves that sends its
blithe play to those spirits, and from the clearness of the
atmosphere comes, warm and ethereal, the ray of that light.
And does the roof of the pastor give shelter to Helen
Mainwaring's youth? Has Death taken from her the
natural protectors? Those forms which we saw so full of
youth and youth's heart, in that very spot, has the grave
closed on them yet? Yet!—how few attain to the age of
the Psalmist! Twenty-seven years have passed since that
date—how often, in those years, have the dark doors

ing died first, care-worn and shame-bowed : the blot on
his name had cankered into his heart. Susan's life, always
precarious, had struggled on, while he lived, by the strong
power of affection and will;-she would not die, for who
then could console him 7 but at his death the power gave
way. She lingered, but lingered dyingly for three years;
and then, for the first time since William's death, she
smiled—that smile remained on the lips of the corpse.
They had had many trials, that young couple whom we
left so prosperous and happy! Not till many years after
their marriage had one sweet consoler been born to them.
In the season of poverty, and shame, and grief, it came;
and there was no pride on Mainwaring's brow when they
placed his first-born in his arms. By her will, the widow
consigned Helen to the joint guardianship of Mr. Fielden
and her sister: but the latter was abroad, her address un-
known, so the vicar for two years had had sole charge of
the orphan. She was not unprovided for. The sum that
Susan brought to her husband had been long since gone,
it is true—lost in the calamity which had wrecked William
Mainwaring's name and blighted his prospects—but Helen's
grandfather, the land-agent, had died some time subsequent
to that event, and, indeed, just before William's death. He
had never forgiven his son the stain on his name—never
assisted, never even seen him since that fatal day—but he left
to Helen a sum of about 8000l.,-for she, at least, was inno-
cent In Mr. Fielden's eyes, Helen was therefore an heiress.
And who among his small range of acquaintance was good

enough for her, not only so richly portioned, but so lovely;
—accomplished too, for her parents had of late years lived
chiefly in France, and languages there are easily learned,
and masters cheap! — Mr. Fielden knew but one, whom
Providence had also consigned to his charge—the sup-
posed son of his old pupil Ardworth; but though a tender
affection existed between the two young persons, it seemed
too like that of brother and sister to afford much ground
for Mr. Fielden's anxiety or hope.
From his window the vicar observed the still attitude of
the young orphan for a few moments, then he pushed aside
his books, rose, and approached her. At the sound of
his tread, she woke from her reverie, and bounded lightly
toward him.
“Ah, you would not see me before 1* she said, in a voice
in which there was the slightest possible foreign accent,
which betrayed the country in which her childhood had
been passed—“I peeped in twice at the window. I wanted
you so much, to walk to the village." But you will come
now—will you not?” added the girl, coaxingly, as she
looked up at him under the shade of her straw hat.
“And what do you want in the village, my pretty

“Why, you know it is Fair day, and you promised
Bessie that you would buy her a fairing—to say nothing
of me.”

not associate our office only with grief, and sickness, and
preaching. We will go. And what fairing are you to
have 7”
“Oh, something very brilliant, I promise you ! I have
formed grand notions of a fair. I am sure it must be like
the bazaars we read of last night, in that charming “Tour
in the East.’” -
The vicar smiled, half benignly, half anxiously. “My
dear child, it is so like you to suppose a village fair must
be an Eastern bazaar. If you always thus judge things
by your fancy, how this sober world will deceive you, poor
Helen l’”
“It is not my fault—ne me grondez pas méchant,”
answered Helen, hanging her head. “But come, sir, allow,
at least, that if I let my romance, as you call it, run away
with me now and then, I can still content myself with the
reality. What, you shake your head still I Don't you
remember the sparrow?”
“Ha! haſ yes—the sparrow that the peddler sold you
for a goldfinch; and you were so proud of your purchase,
and wondered so much why you could not coax the gold-
finch to sing, till at last the paint wore away and it was
only a poor little sparrow !”
“Go on! Confess; did I fret, then? Was I not as
pleased with my dear sparrow, as I should have been with
the prettiest goldfinch that ever sang ! Does not the
sparrow follow me about, and nestle on my shoulder–
dear little thing ! And I was right after all; for if I had
not fancied it a goldfinch, I should not have bought it,

perhaps. But now I would not change it for a goldfinch
—no, not even for that nightingale I heard just now. So
let me still fancy the poor fair a bazaar; it is a double
pleasure, first to fancy the bazaar, and then to be surprised
at the fair.”
“You argue well,” said the vicar, as they now entered
the village. “I really think, in spite of all your turn for
poetry, and Goldsmith, and Cowper, that you would take
as kindly to mathematics as your cousin John Ardworth,
poor lad!”
“Not if mathematics have made him so grave—and so
churlish, I was going to say—but that word does him
wrong. Dear cousin, so kind and so rough 1”
“It is not mathematics that are to blame, if he is grave
and absorbed,” said the vicar, with a sigh; “it is the two
cares that gnaw most—poverty and ambition.”
“Nay, do not sigh: it must be such a pleasure to feel
as he does, that one must triumph at last !”
“Umph!—John must have nearly reached London by
this time,” said Mr. Fielden, “for he is a stout walker, and
this is the third day since he left us. Well, now that he
is about fairly to be called to the bar, I hope that his
fever will cool, and he will settle calmly to work. I have
felt great pain for him during this last visit.”
“Pain But why?”
“My dear, do you remember what I read out to you
both from Sir William Temple, the night before John
left us?”
Helen put her hand to her brow, and with a readiness

which showed a memory equally quick and retentive, re-
plied, “Yes; was it not to this effect? I am not sure of
the exact words—‘To have something we have not, and be
something we are not, is the root of all evil.”
“Well remembered, my darling!”
“Ah, but,” said Helen, archly, “I remember too what
my cousin replied: “If Sir William Temple had practiced
his theory, he would not have been ambassador at the
Hague, or—'”
“Pshawl the boy's always ready enough with his an-
swers,” interrupted Mr. Fielden, rather petulantly. “There's
the fair, my dear; more in your way, I see, than Sir Wil-
liam Temple's philosophy.”
And Helen was right—the fair was no Eastern bazaar:
but how delighted that young, impressionable mind was,
notwithstanding ! delighted with the swings and the round-
abouts, the shows, the booths, even down to the gilt ginger-
bread kings and queens. All minds genuinely poetical, are
peculiarly susceptible to movement—that is, to the excite-
ment of numbers. If the movement is sincerely joyous, as
in the mirth of a village holiday, such a nature shares in-
sensibly in the joy. But if the movement is a false and
spurious gayety, as in a state ball, where the impassive
face and languid step are out of harmony with the evident
object of the scene—then the nature we speak of feels
chilled and dejected. Hence it really is, that the more
delicate and ideal order of minds soon grow inexpressibly
weary of the hack routine of what are called fashionable
pleasures. Hence the same person most alive to a dance

on the green, would be without enjoyment at Almack's.
It is not because one scene is a village green, and the
other a room in King Street; nor is it because the actors
in the one are of the humble, in the other of the noble
class, but simply because the enjoyment in the first is visi-
ble and hearty, because in the other it is a listless and
melancholy pretense. Helen fancied it was the swings and
the booths that gave her that innocent exhilaration—it
was not so; it was the unconscious sympathy with the
crowd around her. When the poetical nature quits its
own dreams for the actual world, it enters and transfuses
itself into the hearts and humors of others. The two
wings of that spirit which we call Genius are reverie and
sympathy. But poor little Helen had no idea that she
had genius. Whether chasing the butterfly, or talking
fond fancies to her birds, or whether with earnest, musing
eyes, watching the stars come forth and the dark pine-
trees gleam into silver; whether with airy day-dreams
and credulous wonder poring over the magic tales of Mir-
glip or Aladdin, or whether spell-bound to awe by the
solemn woes of Lear, or following the blind great bard
into “the heaven of heavens, an earthly guest, to draw
empyreal air,” she obeyed but the honest and varying im-
pulse in each change of her pliant mood; and would have
ascribed with genuine humility to the vagaries of child-
hood, that prompt gathering of pleasure—that quick shift-
ing sport of the fancy by which Nature binds to itself, in
chains undulating as melody, the lively senses of genius.
While Helen, leaning on the vicar's arm, thus sur-

rendered herself to the innocent excitement of the mo-
ment, the vicar himself smiled and nodded to his parish-
ioners, or paused to exchange a friendly word or two with
the youngest or the oldest loiterers (those two extremes of
mortality which the church so tenderly unites), whom the
scene drew to its tempting vortex, when a rough-haired
lad, with a leather bag strapped across his waist, turned
from one of the gingerbread booths, and touching his hat,
said, “Please you, sir, I was a-coming to your house with
a letter.”
The vicar's correspondence was confined and rare, de-
spite his distant children, for letters but a few years ago
were costly luxuries to persons of narrow income, and
therefore the juvenile letter-carrier who plied between the
post town and the village failed to excite in his breast
that indignation for being an hour or more behind his
time, which would have animated one to whom the post
brings the usual event of the day. He took the letter
from the boy's hand, and paid for it with a thrifty sigh, as
he glanced at a handwriting unfamiliar to him—perhaps
from some clergyman poorer than himself. However, that
was not the place to read letters, so he put the epistle in
his pocket, until Helen, who watched his countenance to
see when he grew tired of the scene, kindly proposed to
return home. As they gained a stile half way, Mr. Fielden
remembered his letter, took it forth, and put on his spec-
tacles. Helen stooped over the bank to gather violets;
the vicar seated himself on the stile. As he again looked
at the address, the handwriting, before unfamiliar, seemed

to grow indistinctly on his recollection. That bold, firm
hand—thin and fine as woman's, but large and regular as
man's—was too peculiar to be forgotten. He uttered a
brief exclamation of surprise and recognition, and hastily
broke the seal. The contents ran thus:
“DEAR SIR,--So many years have passed since any com-
munication has taken place between us, that the name of
Lucretia Dalibard will seem more strange to you than that
of Lucretia Clavering. I have recently returned to Eng-
land after long residence abroad. I perceive by my de-
eeased sister's will that she has confided her only daughter
to my guardianship, conjointly with yourself. I am anxious
to participate in that tender charge. I am alone in the
world—an habitual sufferer—afflicted with a partial paral-
ysis that deprives me of the use of my limbs. In such
circumstances, it is the more natural that I should turn to
the only relative left me. My journey to England has so
exhausted my strength, and all movement is so painful,
that I must request you to excuse me for not coming in
person for my niece. Your benevolence, however, will, I
am sure, prompt you to afford me the comfort of her so-
ciety, as soon as you can contrive some suitable arrange-
ment for her journey. Begging you to express to Helen,
in my name, the assurance of such a welcome as is due
from me to my sister's child, and waiting with great anxiety
your reply,–I am, dear sir, your very faithful servant,

to take the journey afforded me the pleasure of seeing you
once again. I am anxious, in addition to such details of
my late sister as you may be enabled to give me, to learn
something of the history of her connection, Mr. Ardworth,
in whom I felt much interested years ago, and who, I am
recently informed, left an infant, his supposed son, under
your care. So long absent from England, how much have
I to learn, and how little the mere gravestones tell us of
the dead l’”
While the vicar is absorbed in this letter, equally un-
welcome and unexpected, - while, unconscious as the
daughter of Ceres gathering flowers when the Hell King
drew near, of the change that awaited her and the grim
presence that approached on her fate, Helen bends still
over the bank odorous with shrinking violets, we turn where
the new generation equally invites our gaze, and make our
first acquaintance with two persons connected with the
progress of our tale.

The britska stopped. The servant, who had been grad-
ually accumulating present dust and future rheumatisms
on the “bad eminence” of a rumble-tumble, exposed to
the nipping airs of an English sky, leapt to the ground
and opened the carriage door.
“This is the best place for the view, sir—a little to the
right.”

Percival St. John threw aside his book (a volume of
Woyages), whistled to a spaniel dozing by his side, and
descended lightly. Light was the step of the young man,
and merry was the bark of the dog, as it chased from the
road the startled sparrow, rising high into the clear air—
favorites of Nature both, man and dog
You had but to glance at Percival St. John to know at
once that he was of the race that toils not; the assured
step spoke confidence in the world's fair smile. No care
for the morrow dimmed the bold eye and the radiant
bloom.
About the middle height—his slight figure, yet unde-
veloped, seemed not to have attained to its full growth—
the darkening down only just shaded a cheek somewhat
sunburnt, though naturally fair, round which locks black
as jet played sportively in the fresh air—about him alto-
gether there was the inexpressible charm of happy youth.
He scarcely looked sixteen, though above four years older;
but for his firm though careless step, and the open fearless-
ness of his frank eye, you might have almost taken him for
a girl in men's clothes, not from effeminacy of feature, but
from the sparkling bloom of his youth, and from his un-
mistakable newness to the cares and sins of man. A more
delightful vision of ingenuous boyhood opening into life
under happy auspices, never inspired with pleased yet
melancholy interest the eye of half envious, half pitying
age.
“And that,” mused Percival St. John—“that is Lon-

His glove fell to the ground, and his spaniel mumbled
it into shreds. The young man laughed, and, throwing
himself on the grass, played gayly with the dog.
“Fie, Beau, sir, fie; gloves are indigestible. Restrain
your appetite, and we'll lunch together at the Clarendon.”
At this moment there arrived at the same patch of
greensward, a pedestrian some years older than Percival
St. John—a tall, muscular, raw-boned, dust-covered, travel-
stained pedestrian—one of your pedestrians in good ear-
nest—no amateur in neat gambroon, manufactured by
Inkson, who leaves his carriage behind him, and walks on
with his fishing-rod by choice, but a sturdy wanderer, with
thick shoes and strapless trowsers, a thread-bare coat, and
a knapsack at his back. Yet withal, the young man had
the air of a gentleman; not gentleman as the word is
understood in St. James's, the gentleman of the noble and
idle class, but the gentleman as the title is accorded, by
courtesy, to all to whom both education and the habit of
mixing with educated persons gives a claim to the distinc-
tion and imparts an air of refinement. The new-comer
was strongly built, at once lean and large—far more
strongly built than Percival St. John, but without his
look of cheerful and comely health. His complexion had

not the florid hues that should have accompanied that
strength of body; it was pale, though not sickly; the ex-
pression grave, the lines deep, the face strongly marked.
By his side trotted painfully a wiry, yellowish, foot-sore
Scotch terrier. Beau sprang from his master's caress,
cocked his handsome head on one side, and suspended in
silent halt his right forepaw. Percival cast over his left
shoulder a careless glance at the intruder. The last
heeded neither Beau nor Percival. He slipped his knap-
sack to the ground, and the Scotch terrier sank upon it,
and curled himself up into a ball. The wayfarer folded
his arms tightly upon his breast, heaved a short unquiet
sigh, and cast over the giant city, from under deep-pent
lowering brows, a look so earnest, so searching, so full of
inexpressible, dogged, determined power, that Percival,
roused out of his gay indifference, rose and regarded him
with curious interest.
In the mean while Beau had very leisurely approached
the bilious-looking terrier; and after walking three times
round him, with a stare and a small sniff of superb imper-
tinence, halted with great composure, and lifting his hind

something irresistibly provocative of insult in the back of
a shabby-looking dog
The poor terrier, used to affronts, raised its heavy eye-
lids, and shot the gleam of just indignation from its dark
eyes. But it neither stirred nor growled, and Beau, ex-
tremely pleased with his achievement, wagged his tail in
triumph, and returned to his master—perhaps, in par-
liamentary phrase, to “report proceedings, and ask leave
to sit again.”
“I wonder,” soliloquized Percival St. John, “what that
poor fellow is thinking of;-perhaps he is poor, indeed!
—no doubt of it, now I look again. And I so rich l I
should like to—hem—let's see what he's made of.”
Herewith Percival approached, and with all a boy's half
bashful, half saucy frankness, said—“A fine prospect, sir.”
The pedestrian started, and threw a rapid glance over
the brilliant figure that accosted him. Percival St. John
was not to be abashed by stern looks; but that glance
might have abashed many a more experienced man. The
glance of a squire upon a corn-law missionary, of a Crock-
ford dandy upon a Regent Street tiger, could not have
been more disdainful.
“Tush 1” said the pedestrian, rudely, and turned upon
his heel.
Percival colored, and, shall we own it? was boy enough
to double his fist. Little would he have been deterred by
the brawn of those great arms and the girth of that Her.

thing to resent pugilistically so discourteous a monosylla-

ble. The “tush |" stuck greatly in his throat. But the
man, now removed to the farther verge of the hill, looked
so tranquil and so lost in thought, that the short-lived
anger died.
“And after all, if I was as poor as he looks, I dare say
I should be just as proud,” muttered Percival. “How-
ever, it's his own fault if he goes to London on foot, when
I might, at least, have given him a lift. Come, Beau, sir.”
With his face still a little flushed, and his hat, uncon-
sciously, cocked fiercely on one side, Percival sauntered
back to his britska.
As in the whirl of dust the light carriage was borne
by the four posters down the hill, the pedestrian turned
for an instant from the view before to the cloud behind,
and muttered—“Ay, a fine prospect for the rich—a noble
field for the poorl” The tone in which those words were
said told volumes; there, spoke the pride, the hope, the

The stranger then threw himself on the sward, and con-
tinued his silent and intent contemplation till the clouds
grew red in the west. When, then, he rose, his eye was
bright, his mien erect, and a smile, playing round his firm,
full lips, stole the moody sternness from his hard face.
Throwing his knapsack once more on his back, John Ard-

C HAPTE R. I.
THE CORONATION.
The eighth of September, 1831, was a holiday in Lon-
don. William IV. received the crown of his ancestors in
that mighty church, in which the most impressive monitors
to human pomp are the monuments of the dead: the dust
of conquerors and statesmen, of the wise heads and the
bold hands that had guarded the thrones of departed kings,
slept around; and the great men of the Modern time
were assembled in homage to the monarch, to whom the
prowess and the liberty of generations had bequeathed an
empire in which the sun never sets. In the Abbey—think-
ing little of the past, caring little for the future—the im-
mense audience gazed eagerly on the pageant that occurs
but once in that division of history—the lifetime of a king
The assemblage was brilliant and imposing. The galleries
sparkled with the gems of women who still upheld the
celebrity for form and feature, which, from the remotest
times, has been awarded to the great English race. Be-
low, in their robes and coronets, were men who neither in
the senate nor the field have shamed their fathers. Con-
spicuous among all, for grandeur of mien and stature,
towered the brothers of the king; while commanding yet
more the universal gaze, were seen, here the eagle features
of the old hero of Waterloo, and there the majestic brow

of the haughty statesman who was leading the people
(while the last of the Bourbons, whom Waterloo had re-
stored to the Tuileries, had left the orb and purple to the
kindred house so fatal to his name) through a stormy and
perilous transition to a bloodless revolution and a new
charter. - *
Tier upon tier, in the division set apart for them, the
members of the Lower House moved and murmured above
the pageant; and the coronation of the new sovereign
was connected in their minds with the great measure
which, still undecided, made at that time a link between
the People and the King; and arrayed against both, if
not, indeed, the real Aristocracy, at least the Chamber
recognized by the Constitution as its representative. With-
out the space was one dense mass. Houses, from balcony
to balcony, window to window, were filled as some im-
mense theater. Up, through the long thoroughfare to
Whitehall, the eye saw that audience—A PEOPLE: and the
gaze was bounded at the spot where Charles I. had passed
from the banquet-house to the scaffold.
The ceremony was over; the procession had swept
slowly by; the last huzza had died away. And, after
taring awhile upon Orator Hunt, who had clambered up
the iron palisade near Westminster Hall, to exhibit his
goodly person in his court attire, the serried crowds, hur-
rying from the shower which then unseasonably descended,
broke into large masses or lengthening columns.
In that part of London which may be said to form a
boundary between its old and its new world, by which, on

the one hand, you pass to Westminster, or through that
gorge of the Strand which leads along endless rows of
shops that have grown up on the sites of the ancient halls
of the Salisburys and the Exeters, the Buckinghams and
Southamptons, to the heart of the City, built around the
primeval palace of the “Tower,”—while, on the other
hand, you pass into the new city of aristocracy and letters,
of art and fashion, embracing the whilom chase of Maryle-
bone, and the once sedge-grown waters of Pimlico;-by
this ignoble boundary (the crossing from the Opera House,
at the bottom of the Haymarket to the commencement of
Charing Cross) stood a person whose discontented coun-
tenance was in singular contrast with the general gayety
and animation of the day. This person, O gentle reader
—this sour, querulous, discontented person—was a king,
too, in his own walk | None might dispute it. He feared
no rebel; he was harassed by no reform; he ruled without
ministers; tools he had, but, when worn out, he replaced
them without a pension or a sigh. He lived by taxes—
but they were voluntary; and his Civil List was supplied,
without demand for the redress of grievances. This per-
son, nevertheless—not deposed, was suspended from his
empire for the day. He was pushed aside; he was for
gotten. He was not distinct from the crowd. Like Titus,
he had lost a day—his vocation was gone. This person
was the Sweeper of the Crossing
He was a character l He was young, in the fairest
prime of youth; but it was the face of an old man on
young shoulders. His hair was long, thin, and prematurely

-streaked with gray; his face was pale and deeply fur-
rowed; his eyes hollow, and their stare gleamed, cold and
stolid, under his bent and shaggy brows. The figure was
at once fragile and ungainly—and the narrow shoulders
curved in a perpetual stoop. It was a person once noticed
that you would easily remember, and associate with some
undefined, painful impression. The manner was humble,
but not meek; the voice was whining, but without pathos.
There was a meager, passionless dullness about the aspect,
though, at times, it quickened into a kind of avid acute-
ness. No one knew by what human parentage this per-
sonage came into the world. He had been reared by the
charity of a stranger, crept through childhood, and mis-
ery, and rags mysteriously; and suddenly succeeded an
old defunct negro in the profitable crossing whereat he is
now standing. All education was unknown to him, so was
all love. In those festive haunts at St. Giles's, where he
who would see “Life in London” may often discover the
boy who has held his horse in the morning, dancing mer-
rily with his chosen damsel at night, our sweeper's char-
acter was austere as Charles the Twelfth's l And the poor
creature had his good qualities 1 He was sensitively alive
to kindness—little enough had been shown him to make
the luxury the more prized from its rarity l—though fond
of money, he would part with it (we do not say cheerfully,
but part with it still) not to mere want, indeed (for he had
been too pinched and starved himself, and had grown too
obtuse to pinching and to starving for the sensitiveness
that prompts to charity), but to any of his companions

who had done him a good service, or who had even warmed
his dull heart by a friendly smile; he was honest, too—
honest to the backbone. You might have trusted him
with gold untold. Through the heavy clod which man's
care had not moulded, nor books enlightened, nor the
priest's solemn lore informed, still natural rays from the
great parent source of Deity struggled, fitful and dim. He
had no lawful name; none knew if sponsors had ever
stood security for his sins at the sacred fount. But he had
christened himself by the strange, unchristianlike name of
“Beck.” There he was, then, seemingly without origin,
parentage, or kindred tie—a lonesome, squalid, bloodless
thing, which the great monster, London, seemed to have
spawned forth of its own self—one of its sickly, miserable,
rickety offspring, whom it puts out at nurse to Penury, at
school to Starvation, and, finally, and literally, gives them
stones for bread, with the option of the gallows or the
dunghill, when the desperate offspring calls on the giant
mother for return and home l
And this creature did love something—loved, perhaps,"
some fellow-being—of that hereafter, when we dive into
the secrets of his privacy. Meanwhile, openly and frankly,
he loved his crossing; he was proud of his crossing; he
was grateful to his crossing. God help thee, son of the
street, why not l He had in it a double affection; that of
serving and being served. He kept the crossing—if the
crossing kept him. He smiled at times to himself when
he saw it lie fair and brilliant amid the mire around it;
it bestowed on him a sense of property! What a man

isthmus of the kennel which was subject to his broom
The Coronation had made one rebellious spirit, when it
swept the sweeper from his crossing.
He stood then half under the colonnade of the Opera
House, as the crowd now rapidly grew thinner and more
scattered: and when the last carriage of a long string of
vehicles had passed by, he muttered audibly :
“It'll take a deal of pains to make she right agin!”
“So you be's ere to-day, Beck?” said a ragamuffin
boy, who, pushing and scrambling through his betters,
now halted, and wiped his forehead, as he looked at the
sweeper. “Wy, we are all out pleasuring. Wy won't you
come with ve?—lots of fun l’
The sweeper scowled at the urchin, and made no an-
swer, but began sedulously to apply himself to the crossing.
“Wy, there isn't another sweep in the streets, Beck. His
Majesty King Bill's Currynation makes all on us so appy!”
“It has made she unkimmon dirty 1" returned Beck,
pointing to the dingy crossing, scarce distinguished from
the rest of the road.
The ragamuffin laughed.
“But we be's goin' to ave Reform now, Beck. The peo-
pul's to have their rights and libties, hand the luds is to

“Hequals l I tells you vot, if you keeps jawing there,
atween me and she, I shall vop you, Joe—cos vy 7–I be’s
the biggest l” was the answer of Beck the sweeper to Joe
the ragamuffin.
The jovial Joe laughed aloud, snapped his fingers, threw
up his ragged cap with a shout for King Bill, and set off
scampering and whooping to join those festivities which
Beck had so churlishly disdained.
Time crept on—evening began to close in, and Beck
was still at his crossing, when a young gentleman on horse-
back, who, after seeing the procession, had stolen away
for a quiet ride in the suburbs, reined in close by the cross-
ing, and, looking round, as for some one to hold his horse,
could discover no loiterer worthy that honor except the
solitary Beck. So young was the rider, that he seemed
still a boy. On his smooth countenance, all that most
prepossesses in early youth left its witching stamp. A
smile, at once gay and sweet, played on his lips. There
was a charm, even in a certain impatient petulance, in his
quick eye, and the slight contraction of his delicate brows.
Almaviva might well have been jealous of such a page 1
He was the beau idéal of Cherubino. He held up his
whip, with an arch sign, to the sweeper. “Follow, my
man,” he said, in a tone, the very command of which
sounded gentle, so blithe was the movement of the lips,
and so silvery the easy accent; and, without waiting, he
ared carelessly down Pall Mall.

The sweeper cast a rueful glance at his melancholy
domain. But he had gained but little that day, and the
offer was too tempting to be rejected. He heaved a sigh,
shouldered his broom, and murmuring to himself that he
would give her a last brush before he retired for the night,
he put his long limbs into that swinging, shambling trot
which characterizes the motion of those professional
jackals, who, having once caught sight of a groomless
rider, fairly hunt him down, and appear, when he least
expects it, the instant he dismounts.
The young rider lightly swung himself from his sleek,
high-bred gray, at the door of one of the clubs in St.
James's Street, patted his horse's neck, chucked the rein
to the sweeper, and sauntered into the house, whistling,
musically—if not from want of thought, certainly from
want of care.
As he entered the club, two or three men, young, in-
deed, but much older, to appearance at least, than him-
self, who were dining together at the same table, nodded
to him their friendly greeting.
“Ah, Perce,” said one, “we have only just sat down—
here is a seat for you.”
The boy blushed shyly as he accepted the proposal, and
the young men made room for him at the table, with a
smiling alacrity which showed that his shyness was no
hinderance to his popularity.
“Who,” said an elderly dandy, dining apart with one
of his contemporaries—“who is that lad? One ought not
to admit such mere boys into the club.”

“He is the only surviving son of an old friend of ours,”
answered the other, dropping his eyeglass. “Young Per-

“St. John I What I Wernon St. John's son 7"
“Yes.”
“He has not his father's good air. These young fellows
have a tone—a something—a want of self-possession, eh?”
“Very true. The fact is, that Percival was meant for
the navy, and even served as a mid. for a year or so. He
was a younger son, then—third, I think. The two elder
ones died, and Master Percival walked into the inheritance.
I don't think he is quite of age yet.”
“Of age 1 he does not look seventeen 1"
“Oh, he is more thin that! I remember him in his

Meanwhile, the talk round the table, at which sate Per-
cival St. John, was animated, lively, and various—the talk
common with young idlers; of horses, and steeple-chases,
and opera-dancers, and reigning beauties, and good-hu-
mored jests at each other. In all this babble, there was a
freshness about Percival St. John's conversation, which
showed that, as yet, for him life had the zest of novelty.
He was more at home about horses and steeple-chases,
than about opera-dancers, and beauties, and the small

scandals of town. Talk on these latter topics did not
seem to interest him; on the contrary, almost to pain.
Shy and modest as a girl, he colored or looked aside when
his more hardened friends boasted of assignations and
love affairs. Spirited, gay, and manly enough in all really
manly points, the virgin bloom of innocence was yet visi-
ble in his frank charming manner. And often, out of
respect for his delicacy, some hearty son of pleasure
stopped short in his narrative, or lost the point of his
anecdote; and yet so lovable was Percival in his good
humor, his naïveté, his joyous entrance into innocent joy,
that his companions were scarcely conscious of the géne
and restraint he imposed on them. Those merry, dark
eyes, and that flashing smile, were conviviality of them-
selves. They brought with them a contagious cheerfulness
which compensated for the want of corruption.
Night had set in. St. John's companions had departed
to their several haunts, and Percival himself stood on the
steps of the club, resolving that he would join the crowds
that swept through the streets to gaze on the illumina-
tions, when he perceived Beck (still at the rein of his
dozing horse), whom he had quite forgot till that moment.
Laughing at his own want of memory, Percival put some
silver into Beck's hand—more silver than Beck had ever
before received for similar service—and said:
“Well, my man, I suppose I can trust you to take my
horse to his stables—No. —, the Mews, behind Curzon
Street. Poor fellow, he wants his supper, and you, too,
I suppose !” -

Beck smiled—a pale, hungry smile, and pulled his fore-
lock politely—“I can take the oss werry safely, your onor.”
“Take him, then, and good evening; but don't get on
for your life.”
“Oh, no, sir; I never gets on: 'taint in my ways.”
And Beck slowly led the horse through the crowd, till
he vanished from Percival's eyes.
Just then, a man passing through the street paused as
he saw the young gentleman on the steps of the club, and
said, gayly, “Ah! how do you do? Pretty faces in plenty
out to-night? Which way are you going?”
“That is more than I can tell you, Mr. Warney. I was
just thinking which turn to take—the right or the left.”
“Then let me be your guide,” and Warney offered his
arm.
Percival accepted the courtesy; and the two walked on
toward Piccadilly. Many a kind glance from the milliners
and maid-servants, whom the illuminations drew abroad,
roved, somewhat impartially, toward St. John and his
companion; but they dwelt longer on the last, for there,
at least, they were sure of a return. Warney, if not in his
first youth, was still in the prime of life; and Time had
dealt with him so leniently, that he retained all the per-
sonal advantages of youth itself. His complexion still was
clear; and as only his upper lip, decorated with a slight,
silken, and well-trimmed moustache, was unshaven, the
contour of the face added to the juvenility of his appear-
ance by the rounded symmetry it betrayed. His hair
escaped from his hat in fair unchanged luxuriance. And

the nervous figure, agile as a panther's, though broad-
shouldered and deep-chested, denoted all the slightness
and elasticity of twenty-five, combined with the muscular
power of forty. His dress was rather fantastic—too showy
for the good taste which is habitual to the English gentle-
man—and there was a peculiarity in his gait almost ap-
proaching to a strut, which bespoke a desire of effect—a
consciousness of personal advantages—equally opposed
to the mien and manner of Percival's usual companions;
yet withal, even the most fastidious would have hesitated
to apply to Gabriel Warney the epithet of “vulgar.”
Many turned to look again; but it was not to remark the
dress or the slight swagger:—an expression of reckless,
sinister power in the countenance—something of vigor
and determination even in that very walk, foppish as it
would have been in most, made you sink all observation
of the mere externals in a sentiment of curiosity toward
the man himself. He seemed a somebody—not a somebody
of conventional rank, but a somebody of personal indi-
viduality—an artist, perhaps, a poet, or a soldier in some
foreign service, but certainly a man whose name you
would expect to have heard of. Among the common
mob of passengers he stood out in marked and distinct
relief.
“I feel at home in a crowd,” said Warney. “Do you
understand me 7”
“I think so,” answered Percival. “If ever I could
become distinguished, I, too, should feel at home in a
crowd.”

“You have ambition, then? you mean to become dis-
tinguished 7” asked Warney, with a sharp, searching
look.
There was a deeper and steadier flash than usual from
Percival's dark eyes, and a manlier glow over his cheek,
at Warney's question. But he was slow in answering;
and when he did so, his manner had all its wonted mixture
of graceful bashfulness and gay candor.
“Our rise does not always depend on ourselves. We
are not all born great, nor do we all have “greatness
thrust on us.’”
“One can be what one likes, with your fortune,” said
Warney; and there was a growl of envy in his voice.
“What, be a painter like you? Ha, ha!”
“Faith,” said Warney, "at least, if you could paint at
all, you would have what I have not—praise and fame.”
Percival pressed kindly on Warney's arm. “Courage 1
you will get justice some day !”
Warney shook his head. “Bah! there is no such thing
as justice; all are underrated or overrated. Can you name
one man whom you think is estimated by the public at his
precise value? As for present popularity, it depends on
two qualities—each singly, or both united—cowardice and
charlatanism; that is, servile compliance with the taste
and opinion of the moment, or a quack's spasmodic efforts
at originality. But why bore you on such matters! There
are things more attractive round us. A good ankle that,
eh? Why, pardon me, it is strange; but you don't seem
to care much for women?”

“Oh, yes, I do,” said Percival, with a sly demureness.
“I am very fond of—my motherl”
“Very proper and filial,” said Warney, laughing; “and
does your love for the sex stop there?”
“Well, and in truth I fancy so—pretty nearly. You
know my grandmother is not alive! But that is something
really worth looking at l” And Percival pointed, almost
with a child's delight, at an illumination more brilliant
than the rest.
“I suppose, when you come of age, you will have all
the cedars at Laughton hung with colored lamps. Ah,
you must ask me there, some day. I should so like to see
the old place again.”
“You never saw it, I think you say, in my poor father's
time 7”
“Never.”
“Yet you knew him.”
“But slightly.”
“And you never saw my mother ?”
“No ; but she seems to have such influence over you,
that I am sure she must be a very superior person—rather
proud, I suppose.”
“Proud—no; that is, not exactly proud, for she is very
meek and very affable. But yet 17
“But yet—you hesitate—she would not like you to be
seen, perhaps, walking in Piccadilly with Gabriel Warney,
the natural son of old Sir Miles's librarian,—Gabriel

his character and honor, my mother would only be pleased
that I should know an able and accomplished person, what-
ever his origin or parentage. But my mother would be
sad if she knew me intimate with a Bourbon or a Raffaelle,
the first in rank or the first in genius, if either prince or
artist had lost or even sullied his 'scutheon of gentleman.
In a word, she is most sensitive as to honor and conscience
—all else she disregards.”
“Heml" Warney stooped down, as if examining the
polish of his boot, while he continued, carelessly—“Im-
possible to walk the streets and keep one's boots out of
the mirel Well—and you agree with your mother?”
“It would be strange if I did not. When I was scarcely
four years old, my poor father used to lead me through the
long picture-gallery at Laughton, and say, ‘Walk through
life as if those brave gentlemen looked down on you.
And,” added St. John, with his ingenuous smile—“my
mother would put in her word—"And those unstained
women, too, my Percival!’”
There was something noble and touching in the boy's
low accents as he said this; it gave the key to his unusual
modesty, and his frank, healthful innocence of character.
The devil in Warney's lip sneered mockingly.
“My young friend, you have never loved yet.—Do you
think you ever shall?”
“I have dreamed that I could love one day. But I can
wait.”
Warney was about to reply, when he was accosted
abruptly by three men of that exaggerated style of dress

and manner which is implied by the vulgar appellation of
“Tigrish.” Each of the three men had a cigar in his
mouth—each seemed flushed with wine. One wore long
brass spurs, and immense moustaches; another was dis-
tinguished by an enormous surface of black satin cravat,
across which meandered a Pactolus of gold chain; a third
had his coat laced and braided, a la Polonaise, and pinched
and padded a la Russe, with trowsers shaped to the calf of
a sinewy leg, and a glass screwed into his right eye.
“Ah, Gabriell—ah, Warney l—ah, prince of good fel-
lows, well met! You sup with us to-night at little Céleste's
—we were just going in search of you.”
“Who's your friend—one of us?” whispered a second.
And the third screwed his arm tight and lovingly into
Warney's.
Gabriel, despite his habitual assurance, looked abashed
for a moment, and would have extricated himself from
cordialities not at that moment welcome; but he saw that
his friends were too far gone in their cups to be easily
shaken off, and he felt relieved when Percival, after a dis-
satisfied glance at the three, said, quietly—“I must detain
you no longer—I shall soon look in at your studio;” and,
without waiting for answer, slid off and was lost among
the crowd.
Warney walked on with his new-found friends, unheeding
for some moments their loose remarks and familiar banter.
At length he shook off his abstraction, and surrendering
himself to the coarse humors of his companions, soon
eclipsed them all by the gusto of his slang and the mock-

ing profligacy of his sentiments; for here he no longer
played a part, or suppressed his grosser instincts. That
uncurbed dominion of the senses, to which his very boy-
hood had abandoned itself, found a willing slave in the
man. Even the talents themselves that he displayed came
from the cultivation of the sensual. His eye, studying
externals, made him a painter—his ear, quick and practiced,
a musician. His wild, prodigal fancy rioted on every ex-
citement, and brought him in a vast harvest of experience
in knowledge of the frailties and the vices on which it in-
dulged its vagrant experiments. Men who overcultivate
the art that connects itself with the senses, with little
counterpoise from the reason and pure intellect, are apt .
to be dissipated and irregular in their lives. This is fre-
quently noticeable in the biographies of musicians, singers,
and painters, less so in poets, because he who deals with
words, not signs and tones, must perpetually compare his
senses with the pure images of which the senses only see
the appearances; in a word, he must employ his intellect,
and his self-education must be large and comprehensive.
But with most real genius, however fed merely by the
senses—most really great painters, singers, and musicians,
however easily led astray into temptation, the richness of
the soil throws up abundant good qualities to countervail
or redeem the evil—they are usually compassionate, gen-
erous, sympathizing. That Warney had not such beauties
of soul and temperament, it is unnecessary to add—princi-
pally, it is true, because of his nurture, education, parental
example, the utter corruption in which his childhood and

youth had passed—partly because he had no real genius,
it was a false apparition of the divine spirit, reflected from
the exquisite perfection of his frame (which rendered all
his senses so vigorous and acute), and his riotous fancy,
and his fitful energy, which was capable at times of great
application, but not of definite purpose or earnest study.
All about him. was flashy and hollow. He had not the
natural subtlety and depth of mind that had characterized
his terrible father. The graft of the opera-dancer was
visible on the stock of the scholar; wholly without the
habits of method and order, without the patience, without
the mathematical, calculating brain of Dalibard, he played
wantonly with the horrible and loathsome wickedness of
which Olivier had made dark and solemn study. Extrava-
gant and lavish, he spent money as fast as he gained it;
he threw away all chances of eminence and career. In the
midst of the direst plots of his villainy, or the most ener-
getic pursuit of his art, the poorest excitement, the veriest
bauble would draw him aside. His heart was with Falri
in the sty, his fancy with Aladdin in the palace. To make
a show was his darling object; he loved to create effect by
his person, his talk, his dress, as well as by his talents.
Living from hand to mouth, crimes through which it is not
our intention to follow him had at times made him rich to-
day, for vices to make him poor again to-morrow. What
he called “luck,” or “his star,” had favored him—he was
not hanged 1–he lived; and, as the greater part of his
unscrupulous career had been conducted in foreign lands,
and under other names,—in his own name, and in his own

country, though something scarcely to be defined, but
equivocal and provocative of suspicion, made him dis-
pleasing to the prudent, and vaguely alarmed the experi-
ence of the sober, still no positive accusation was at-
tached to the general integrity of his character; and the
mere dissipation of his habits was naturally little known
out of his familiar circle. Hence, he had the most pre-
sumptuous confidence in himself—a confidence native to
his courage, and confirmed by his experience. His con-
science was so utterly obtuse, that he might almost be said
to present the phenomenon of a man without conscience at
all. Unlike Conrad, he did not “know himself a villain;”
all that he knew of himself was, that he was a remarkably
clever fellow, without prejudice or superstition. That, with
all his gifts, he had not succeeded better in life, he ascribed
carelessly to the surpassing wisdom of his philosophy. He
could have done better if he had enjoyed himself less—but
was not enjoyment the be all and end all of this little life?
More often, indeed, in the moods of his bitter envy, he
would lay the fault upon the world. How great he could
have been if he had been rich and high born 1 Oh, he
was made to spend, not to save—to command, not to fawn 1
He was not formed to plod through the dull mediocrities
of fortune; he must toss up for the All or the Nothing!
It was no control over himself that made Warney now turn
his thoughts from certain grave designs on Percival St.
John, to the brutal debauchery of his three companions,—
rather he then yielded most to his natural self. And when
the morning star rose over the night he passed with low

profligates and venal nymphs, when, over the fragments
on the board and emptied bottles, and drunken riot, dawn
gleamed and saw him in all the pride of his magnificent
organization, and the cynicism of his measured vice;—fair,
fresh, and blooming amid those maudlin eyes, and flushed
cheeks, and reeling figures;–laughing hideously over the
spectacle he had provoked, and kicking aside, with a
devil's scorn, the prostrate form of the favored partner
whose head had rested on his bosom, as alone with a
steady step he passed the threshold, and walked into the
fresh, healthful air;-Gabriel Warney enjoyed the fell tri-
umph of his hell-born vanity, and reveled in his sentiment
of superiority and power.
Meanwhile, on quitting Warney, young Percival strolled
on as the whim directed him. Turning down the Hay-
market, he gained the colonnade of the Opera House.
The crowd there was so dense that his footsteps were ar-
rested, and he leant against one of the columns in admira-
tion of the various galaxies in view. In front blazed the
rival stars of the United Service Club and the Athenaeum;
—to the left, the quaint and peculiar device which lighted
up Northumberland House;—to the right, the anchors,
cannons, and bombs, which typified ingeniously the martial
attributes of the Ordnance Office.
At that moment there were three persons connected
with this narrative within a few feet of each other, dis-
tinguished from the multitude by the feelings with which
each regarded the scene and felt the jostle of the crowd.
Percival St. John, in whom the harmless sense of pleasure

was yet vivid and unsatiated, caught from the assemblage
only that physical hilarity which heightened his own spirits.
If in a character as yet so undeveloped—to which the large
passions and stern ends of life were as yet unknown—stirred
some deeper and more musing thoughts and speculations,
giving gravity to the habitual smile on his rosy lip, and
steadying the play of his sparkling eyes, he would have
been at a loss himself to explain the dim sentiment, and
the vague desire.
Screened by another column from the pressure of the
mob, with his arms folded on his breast, a man some few
years older in point of time—many years older in point of
character—gazed (with thoughts how turbulent—with am:
bition how profound !) upon the dense and dark masses
that covered space and street far as the eye could reach.
He, indeed, could not have said, with Warney, that he was
“at home in a crowd.” For a crowd did not fill him with
—the sense of his own individual being and importance, but
grappled him to its mighty breast with the thousand tissues
of a common destiny. Who shall explain and disentangle
those high, and restless, and interwoven emotions with
which intellectual ambition, honorable and ardent, gazes
upon that solemn thing with which, in which, for which it
lives and labors—the Human Multitude 7 To that ab-
stracted, solitary man, the illumination, the festivity, the
curiosity, the holiday, were nothing, or but as fleeting
phantoms and vain seemings. In his heart's eye he saw
before him but the PEoPLE, the shadow of an everlasting
audience—audience at once and judge

And literally touching him as he stood, the ragged
sweeper, who had returned in vain to devote a last care
to his beloved charge, stood arrested with the rest, gazing
joylessly on the blazing lamps, dead as the stones he
heeded, to the young vivacity of the one plan, the solemn
visions of the other. So, O London, amid the universal

I, O V E AT FIRST SIGHT
SuppENLY across the gaze of Percival St. John there
flashed a face that woke him from his abstraction as a
light awakes the sleeper. It was as a recognition of
something seen dimly before—a truth coming out from a
dream. It was not the mere beauty of that face (and
beautiful it was) that arrested his eye, and made his heart
beat more quickly—it was rather that nameless and in-
explicable sympathy which constitutes love at first sight;
—a sort of impulse and instinct common to the dullest as
the quickest—the hardest reason as the liveliest fancy.
Plain Cobbett, seeing before the cottage door, at her
homeliest of housework, the girl of whom he said—“That
girl should be my wife;” and Dante, first thrilled by the
vision of Beatrice, are alike true types of a common ex-
perience: Whatever of love sinks the deepest is felt at
first sight; it streams on us abrupt from the cloud, a
lightning flash—a destiny revealed to us face to face
Now, there was nothing poetical in the place or the cir-
cumstance, still less in the companionship in which this
fair creature startled the virgin heart of that careless boy;
she was leaning on the arm of a stout, rosy-faced matron
in a puce-colored gown, who was flanked on the other side
(836)

by a very small, very spare man, with a very wee face, the
lower part of which was enveloped in an immense belcher.
Besides these two incumbrances, the stout lady contrived
to carry in her hands an umbrella, a basket, and a pair of
pattens.
In the midst of the strange, unfamiliar emotion which
his eye conveyed to his heart, Percival's ear was displeas-
ingly jarred by the loud, bluff, hearty voice of the girl's
female companion:
“Gracious me! if that is not John Ardworth; who'd
have thought it? Why, John—I say, John I" and lifting
her umbrella horizontally, she poked aside two city clerks
in front of her, wheeled round the little man on her left,
upon whom the clerks simultaneously bestowed the appel-
lation of “feller,” and driving him, as being the sharpest
and thinnest wedge at hand, through a dense knot of some
half a dozen gapers, while following his involuntary pro-
gress she looked defiance on the malcontents, she suc-
ceeded in clearing her way to the spot where stood the
young man she had discovered. The ambitious dreamer,
for it was he, thus detected and disturbed, looked embar-
rassed for a moment, as the stout lady, touching him with
the umbrella, said: -
“Well, I declare, if this is not too bad l You sent word
that you should not be able to come out with us to see the
'luminations, and here you are as large as lifel"
“I did not think, at the moment you wrote to me,
that—”

“Oh, stuff!” interrupted the stout woman, with a sig
nificant, good-humored shake of her head, “I know what's
what; tell the truth, and shame the gentleman who objects
to showing his feet. You are a wild fellow, John Ard-
worth—you are you like looking after the pretty faces—
you do—you do—ha, ha, ha! very naturall So did you
once—did not you, Mr. Mivers—did not you, eh? men
must be men—they always are men, and its my belief that
men they always will be l’’
With this sage conjecture into the future, the lady
turned to Mr. Mivers, who, thus appealed to, extricated
with some difficulty his chin from the folds of his belcher,
and putting up his small face, said, in a small voice, “Yes, .
I was a wild fellow once, but you have tamed me ! you
have, Mrs. M.” -
And therewith the chin sunk again into the belcher,
and the small voice died into a small sigh.
The stout lady glanced benignly at her spouse, and then
resuming her address, to which Ardworth listened with a
half frown and a half smile, observed, encouragingly:
“Yes, there's nothing like a lawful wife to break a man
in, as you will find some day. Howsomever, your time's
not come for the Altar, so suppose you give Helen your
arm and come with us.”
“Do,” said Helen, in a sweet, coaxing voice.
Ardworth bent down his rough, earnest face to Helen's,
and an evident pleasure relaxed its thoughtful lines. “I
cannot resist you,” he began, and then he paused and
frowned. “Pish 1” he added; “I was talking folly; but

what head would not you turn? Resist you I must, for I
am on my way now to my drudgery. Ask me anything,
some years hence, when I have time to be happy, and
then see if I am the bear you now call me.”
“Well,” said Mrs. Mivers, emphatically, “are you com-
ing, or are you not ? Don't stand there, shilly-shally.”
“Mrs. Mivers,” returned Ardworth, with a kind of sly
humor, “I am sure you would be very angry with your
husband's excellent shopmen, if that was the way they
spoke to your customers. If some unhappy dropper-in-
some lady who came to buy a yard or so of Irish, was
suddenly dazzled, as I am, by a luxury wholly unforeseen
and eagerly coveted—a splendid lace veil, or a ravishing
cashmere, or whatever else you ladies desiderate, and
while she was balancing between prudence and tempta-
tion, your foreman exclaimed—"Don't stand shilly-shally,”
—come, I put it to you.”
“Stuff!” said Mrs. Mivers.
“Alas! unlike your imaginary customer—(I hope so, at
least, for the sake of your till)—prudence gets the better
of me; unless,” added Ardworth, irresolutely, and glanc-
ing at Helen —“unless, indeed, you are not sufficiently
protected, and 77
“Purtected 1" exclaimed Mrs. Mivers, in an indignant
tone of astonishment, and agitating the formidable um-
brella, “as if I was not enough, with the help of this here
domestic commodity, to purtect a dozen such. Purtected,
indeed!”
“John is right, Mrs. M.; business is business,” said Mr.

Mivers. “Let us move on—we stop the way, and those
idle lads are listening to us, and sniggering.”
“Sniggering !” exclaimed the gentle helpmate; “I
should like to see those who presume for to snigger;” and
as she spoke she threw a look of defiance around her.
Then, having thus satisfied her resentment, she prepared
to obey, as no doubt she always did, her lord and master.
Suddenly, with a practiced movement, she wheeled round
Mr. Mivers, and taking care to protrude before him the
sharp point of the umbrella, cut her way through the crowd
like the scythed car of the ancient Britons, and was soon
lost amid the throng, although her way might be guessed
by a slight ripple of peculiar agitation along the general
stream, accompanied by a prolonged murmur of reproach
or expostulation which gradually died in the distance.
Ardworth gazed after the fair form of Helen with a
look of regret; and, when it vanished,—with a slight start
and a suppressed sigh he turned away, and with the long,
steady stride of a strong man, cleared his path through the
Strand, toward the printing-office of a journal on which he
was responsibly engaged.
But Percival, who had caught much of the conversation
that took place so near him—Percival, happy child of idle-
ness and whim, had no motive of labor and occupation to
stay the free impulse of his heart, and his heart drew him
on, with magnetic attraction, in the track of the first being
that had ever touched the sweet instincts of youth.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Mivers was destined to learn—though,
perhaps, the lesson little availed her—that to get smoothly

through this world it is necessary to be supple as well as
strong; and though, up to a certain point, man or woman
may force the way by poking umbrellas into people's ribs,
and treading mercilessly upon people's toes, yet the endu-
rance of ribs and toes has its appointed limits.
Helen, half terrified, also half amused by her com.
panion's robust resolution of purpose, had in Mrs. Mivers
general courage and success that confidence which the
weak repose in the strong, and though, whenever she
turned her eyes from the illuminations, she besought Mrs.
Mivers to be more gentle, yet, seeing that they had gone
safely from St. Paul's to St. James's, she had no distinct
apprehension of any practically ill results from the energies
she was unable to mitigate. But now, having just gained
the end of St. James's Street, Mrs. Mivers at last found
her match. The crowd here halted, thick and serried, to
gaze in peace upon the brilliant vista which the shops and
clubs of that street presented. Coaches and carriages had
paused in their line, and immediately before Mrs. Mivers
stood three very thin, small women, whose dress bespoke
them to be of the humblest class.
“Make way, there—make way, my good women, make
way !” cried Mrs. Mivers, equally disdainful of the size
and the rank of the obstructing parties.
Arrah, and what shall we make way for the like of you,
you ould busy body?” said one of the dames, turning
round, and presenting a very formidable squint to the
broad optics of Mrs. Mivers.
Without deigning a reply, Mrs. Mivers had recourse to

her usual tactics. Umbrella and husband went right be.
tween two of the feminine obstructives; and to the incon-
ceivable astonishment and horror of the assailant, husband
and umbrella instantly vanished. The three small furies
had pounced upon both. They were torn from their
natural owner—they were hurried away; the stream be-
hind, long fretted at the path so abruptly made amid it,
closed in, joyous with a thousand waves. Mrs. Mivers
and Helen were borne forward in one way, the umbrella
and the husband in the other: at the distance a small
voice was heard—“Don’t you!—don't! Be quietl Mrs.
—Mrs. M. Oh 1 oh! Mrs. M. l'” At that last repeti-
tion of the beloved and familiar initial, uttered in a tone
of almost superhuman anguish, the conjugal heart of Mrs.
Mivers was afflicted beyond control.
“Wait here a moment, my dear! I'll just give it them
—that's all!” And in another moment Mrs. Mivers was
heard bustling, scolding, till all trace of her whereabout
was gone from the eyes of Helen. Thus left alone, in
exceeding shame and dismay, the poor girl cast a glance
around. The glance was caught by two young men, whose
station, in these days when dress is an equivocal desig-
nator of rank, could not be guessed by their exterior.
They might be dandies from the west—they might be
clerks from the east.
“By Jove,” exclaimed one, “that's a sweet pretty girl!"
and, by a sudden movement of the crowd, they both found
themselves close to Helen.
“Are you alone, my dear?” said a voice rudely familiar

Helen made no reply—the tone of the voice frightened
her. A gap in the mob showed the space toward Cleve-
land Row, which, leading to no illuminations, was vacant
and solitary. She instantly made toward this spot; the
two men followed her,-the bolder and elder one occasion-
ally trying to catch hold of her arm. At last, as she
passed the last house to the left, a house then owned by
One who, at once far-sighted and impetuous, affable and
haughty-characterized alike by solid virtues and bril-
liant faults—would, but for hollow friends, have triumphed
over countless foes, and enjoyed at last that brief day of
stormy power for which statesmen resign the health of
manhood and the hope of age—as she passed that memor-
able mansion, she suddenly perceived that the space before
her had no thoroughfare, and, while she paused in dismay,
her pursuers blockaded her escape.
One of them now fairly seized her hand: “Nay, pretty
one, why so cruel ? But one kiss—only one !” He en-
deavored to pass his arm round her waist while he spoke.
Helen eluded him, and darted forward, to find her way
stopped by her persecutor's companion, when, to her aston-
ishment, a third person gently pushed aside the form that
impeded her path, approached, and looking mute defiance
at the unchivalric molesters, offered her his arm. Helen
gave but one timid hurrying glance to her unexpected
protector: something in his face, his air, his youth, ap-
pealed at once to her confidence. Mechanically, and
scarce knowing what she did, she laid her trembling hand
on the arm held out to her.

344 LU CRETIA.
The two Lotharios looked foolish. One pulled up his
shirt collar, the other turned, with a forced laugh, on his
heel. Boy as Percival seemed, and little more than boy
as he was, there was a dangerous fire in his eye, and an
expression of spirit and ready courage in his whole counte-
nance, which, if it did not awe his tall rivals, made them
at least unwilling to have a scene, and provoke the inter-
ference of the policemen, one of whom was now seen walk-
ing slowly up to the spot. They, therefore, preserved a
discomfited silence; and Percival St. John, with his heart
going ten knots a beat, sailed triumphantly off with his
prize.
Scarcely knowing whither he went, certainly forgetful
of Mr. Mivers, in his anxiety to escape at least from the
crowd, Percival walked on till he found himself with his
fair charge under the trees of St. James's Park.
Then Helen, recovering herself, paused, and said,
alarmed, “But this is not my way—I must go back to
the street !”
“How foolish I am—that is true!” said Percival, look-
ing confused. “I—I felt so happy to be with you, feel
your hand on my arm, and think that we were all by our.
selves, that—that—but you have dropped your flowers!”
And as a bouquet Helen wore, dislodged somehow on
other, fell to the ground, both stooped to pick it up, and
their hands met. At that touch Percival felt a strange
tremble, which perhaps communicated itself (for such things
are contagious) to his fair companion. Percival had got
the nosegay, and seemed willing to detain it, for he bent

LU CRETIA. 345
his face lingeringly over the flowers. At length he turned
his bright ingenuous eyes to Helen, and singling one rose
from the rest, said beseechingly: “May I keep this? See,
it is not so fresh as the others.”
“I am sure, sir,” said Helen, coloring, and looking
down, “I owe you so much that I should be glad if a poor
flower could repay it.”
“A poor flowerl You don't know what a prize this is
to me!”
Percival placed the rose reverently in his bosom, and
the two moved back slowly, as if reluctant both, through
the old palace court into the street.
“Is that lady related to you?” asked Percival, looking
another way, and dreading the reply. “Not your mother,
surely ſ”
“Oh, no!—I have no motherl”
“Forgive me!” said Percival, for the tone of Helen's
voice told him that he had touched the spring of a house-
hold sorrow. “And,” he added, with a jealousy that he
could scarcely restrain from making itself evident in his
accent, “that gentleman who spoke to you under the
Colonnade,-I have seen him before, but where I cannot
remember. In fact, you have put everything but yourself
out of my head. Is he related to you?”
“He is my cousin.”
“Cousin!” repeated Percival, pouting a little; and again
there was silence.
“I don't know how it is,” said Percival, at last, and
very gravely, as if much perplexed by some abstruse
29 is

thought, “but I feel as if I had known you all my life
I never felt this for any one before.”
There was something so irresistibly innocent in the boy's
serious, wondering tone, as he said these words, that a
smile, in spite of herself, broke out among the thousand
dimples round Helen's charming lips. Perhaps the little
witch felt a touch of coquetry for the first time.
Percival, who was looking sidelong into her face, saw
the smile, and said, drawing up his head, and shaking
back his jetty curls, “I dare say you are laughing at me
as a mere boy; but I am older than I look. I am sure I
am much older than you are. Let me see, you are seven-
teen, I suppose?”
Helen, getting more and more at-her ease, nodded
playful assent.
“And I am not far from twenty-one. Ah! you may
well look surprised—but so it is. An hour ago I felt a
mere boy; now I shall never feel a boy again!”
Once more there was a long pause, and before it was
broken they had gained the very spot in which Helen had
lost her friend.
“Why, bless us, and save us!” exclaimed a voice,
“loud as a trumpet,” but not “with a silver sound,”
“there you are, after all;” and Mrs. Mivers (husband
and umbrella both regained) planted herself full before
them.
“Oh, a pretty fright I have been in ; and now to see
you coming along as cool as if nothing had happened—as
if the humbrella had not lost its hivory andle—it's quite

purvoking. Dear, dear! what we have gone through I
And who is this young gentleman, pray ?”
Helen whispered some hesitating explanation, which
Mrs. Mivers did not seem to receive as graciously as
Percital, poor fellow, had a right to expect. She stared
him full in the face, and shook her head suspiciously when
she saw him a little confused by the survey. Then, tuck-
ng Helen tightly under her arm, she walked back toward
the Haymarket, merely saying to Percival:
“Much obligated, and good night. I have a long
journey to take to set down this here young lady, and the
best thing we can all do is to get home as fast as we can,
and have a refreshing cup of tea—that's my mind, sir.
Excuse me!”
Thus abruptly dismissed, poor Percival gazed wistfully
on his Helen as she was borne along, and was somewhat
comforted at seeing her look back, with (as he thought) a
touch of regret in her parting smile. Then suddenly it
flashed across him how sadly he had wasted his time.
Novice that he was, he had not even learned the name
and address of his new acquaintance. At that thought he
hurried on through the crowd, but only reached the object
of his pursuit just in time to see her placed in a coach, and
to catch a full view of the luxuriant proportions of Mrs.
Mivers as she followed her into the vehicle.
As the lumbering conveyance (the only coach on the
stand) heaved itself into motion, Percival's eye fell on the
sweeper, who was still leaning on his broom, and who, in
grateful recognition of the unwonted generosity that had

repaid his service, touched his ragged hat and smiled
drowsily on his young customer. Love sharpens the wit,
and animates the timid; a thought worthy of the most
experienced, inspired Percival St. John : he hurried to
the sweeper, laid his hand on his patchwork coat, and
said, breathlessly:
“You see that coach turning into the square; follow it
—find out where it sets down. There's a sovereign for
you—another if you succeed. Call and tell me your suc-
cess. Number Curzon Street l–off, like a shot!”
The sweeper nodded and grinned ; it was possibly not
his first commission of a similar kind. He darted down
the street; and Percival, following him with equal speed,
had the satisfaction to see him, as the coach traversed St.
James's Square, comfortably seated on the footboard.
Beck, dull clod, knew nothing, cared nothing, felt no-
thing as to the motives or purpose of his employer. Honest
love or selfish vice, it was the same to him. He saw only
the one sovereign which, with astounded eyes, he still
gazed at on his palm, and the vision of the sovereign that
was yet to come:
“Scandit aeratas witiosa naves
Cura: nec turmas equitum relinquit.”
It was the Selfishness of London—calm and stolid,
whether on the track of innocence or at the command of
guile.
At half-past ten o'clock, Percival St. John was seated
in his room, and the sweeper stood at the threshold.


## p. 349 (#355) ############################################

LU CRETIA, 349
Wealth and penury seemed brought into visible contact
in the persons of the visitor and the host. The dwelling
is held by some to give an index to the character of the
owner: if so, Percival's apartments differed much from
those generally favored by young men of rank and fortune.
On the one hand, it had none of that affectation of superior
taste, evinced in marqueterie and gilding, or the more
picturesque discomfort of highbacked chairs and medieval
curiosities which prevails in the daintier abodes of fastidi-
ous bachelors. Nor, on the other hand, had it the sport-
ing character which individualizes the ruder juvenile “qui
gaudent equis,” betrayed by engravings of racers and
celebrated fox-hunts, relieved, perhaps, if the Nimrod
condescend to a cross of the Lovelace, with portaits of
figurantes, and ideals of French sentiment, entitled, “Le
Soir,” or “La Reveillée,” “L’Espoir,” or “L’Abandon.”
But the rooms had a physiognomy of their own, from
their exquisite neatness and cheerful simplicity. The
chintz draperies were lively with gay flowers; books filled
up the niches; here and there were small pictures, chiefly
sea-pieces—well chosen, well placed.
There might, indeed, have been something almost ef.
feminate in a certain inexpressible purity of taste, and a
cleanliness of detail that seemed actually brilliant, had not
the folding-doors allowed a glimpse of a plainer apart-
ment, with fencing-foils and boxing-gloves ranged on the
wall, and a cricket-bat resting carelessly in the corner.
These gave a redeeming air of manliness to the rooms, but

it was the manliness of a boy; half girl, if you please, in
the purity of thought that pervaded one room, all boy in
the playful pursuits that were made manifest in the other.
Simple, however, as this abode really was, poor Beck had
never been admitted to the sight of anything half so fine.
He stood at the door for a moment, and stared about him,
bewildered and dazzled. But his natural torpor to things
that concerned him not soon brought to him the same
stoicism that philosophy gives the strong; and after the
first surprise, his eye quietly settled on his employer. St.
John rose eagerly from the sofa, on which he had been
contemplating the starlit tree-tops of Chesterfield Gardens:
“Well, well ?” said Percival.
“Hold Brompton,” said Beck, with a brevity of word
and clearness of perception worthy a Spartan.
“Old Brompton?” repeated Percival, thinking the reply
the most natural in the world.
“In a big ous by hisself,” continued Beck, “with a igh
wall in front.”
“You would know it again?”
“In course; he's so wery pecular.”
“He f who?”
“Wy, the ous. The young lady got out, and the hold
folks driv back. I did not go arter them!” and Beck
looked sly.
“So;—I must find out the name.”
“I axed at the public,” said Beck, proud of his di-
plomacy. “They keeps a sarvant vot takes half a pint at
her meals. The young lady's ma be a foriner.”

“A foreigner! Then she lives there with her mother?"
“So they 'spose at the public.”
“And the name?”
Beck shook his head. “”Tis a French un, your onor;
but the sarvant's is Martha.”
“You must meet me at Brompton, near the turnpike,
to-morrow, and show me the house.”
“Wy, I's in bizness all day, please your onor.”
“In business?”
“I’s the place of the crossing,” said Beck, with much
dignity; “but arter eight I goes where I likes.”
“To-morrow evening, then, at half-past eight, by the
turnpike.”
Beck pulled his forelock assentingly.
“There's the sovereign I promised you, my poor fellow
—much good may it do you. Perhaps you have some
father or mother whose heart it will glad.”
“I never had no such thing,” replied Beck, turning the
coin in his hand.
“Well, don't spend it in drink.”
“I never drinks nothing but swipes.”
“Then,” said Percival, laughingly, “what, my good
friend, will you ever do with your money?”
Beck put his finger to his nose, sunk his voice into a
whisper, and replied, solemnly—“I as a mattris.”
“A mistress,” said Percival; “oh, a sweetheart! Well;
but if she's a good girl, and loves you, she'll not let you
spend your money on her.”
“I haint such a ninny as that,” said Beck, with majestic

contempt. “I 'spises the flat that is done brown by the
blowens. I as a mattris.”
“A mattress! a mattress! Well, what has that to do
with the money?”
“Wy, I lines it.”
Percival looked puzzled. “Oh,” said he, after a thought-
ful pause, and in a tone of considerable compassion, “I
understand; you sew your money in your mattress. My
poor, poor lad, you can do better than that l—there are
the savings banks.”
Beck looked frightened: “I opes your onor vont tell no

know nothing vatsomever about it. Now, I knows were it
is—and I lays, on it.”
“Do you sleep more soundly when you lie on your
treasure?” *
“No; it's hodd,” said Beck, musingly, “but the more I
lines it, the worse I sleeps.”
Percival laughed; but there was melancholy in his
laughter; something in the forlorn, benighted, fatherless,
squalid miser, went to the core of his open, generous
heart.
“Do you ever read your Bible?” said he, after a pause;
“—or even the newspaper?”
“I does not read nothing, cos vy, I haint been made a
schollard, like swell Tim, as was lagged for a forgery.”
“You go to church on a Sunday?”
“Yes; I 'as a weekly hingagement at the New Road.”
“What do you mean?”

Percival lifted his brilliant eyes, and they were moist-
ened with a heavenly dew, on the dull face of his fellow-
creature. Beck made a scrape, looked round, shambled
back to the door, and ran home, through the lamp-lit
streets of the great mart of the Christian universe, to sew
the gold in his mattress. -

EARLY TRAINING FOR AN UPRIGHT GENTLEMAN
PERCIvaL ST. John had been brought up at home
under the eye of his mother and the care of an excellent
man, who had been tutor to himself and his brothers.
The tutor was not much of a classical scholar, for, in
great measure, he had educated himself; and he who does
so, usually lacks the polish and brilliancy of one whose
footsteps have been led early to the Temple of the Muses.
In fact, Captain Greville was a gallant soldier, with whom
Vernon St. John had been acquainted in his own brief
military career, and whom circumstances had so reduced
in life as to compel him to sell his commission and live as
he could. He had always been known in his regiment as
a reading man, and his authority looked up to in all the
disputes as to history and dates, and literary anecdotes,
which might occur at the mess-table. Vernon considered
him the most learned man of his acquaintance; and, when

accidentally meeting him in London, he learned his fallen
fortunes, he congratulated himself on a very brilliant idea,
when he suggested that Captain Greville should assist him
in the education of his boys and the management of his
estate. At first, all that Greville modestly undertook,
with respect to the former, and, indeed, was expected to
do, was to prepare the young gentlemen for Eton, to
which Vernon, with the natural predilection of an Eton
man, destined his sons. But the sickly constitutions of
the two elder justified Lady Mary in her opposition to a
public school; and Percival conceived early so strong an
affection for a sailor's life, that the father's intentions were
frustrated. The two elder continued their education at
home; and Percival, at an earlier age than usual, went to
sea. The last was fortunate enough to have for his cap-
tain one of that new race of naval officers who, well edu-
cated and accomplished, form a notable contrast to the
old heroes of Smollet. Percival, however, had not been
long in the service before the deaths of his two elder
brothers, preceded by that of his father, made him the
head of his ancient house and the sole prop of his mother's
earthly hopes. He conquered with a generous effort the
passion for his noble profession, which service had but
confirmed, and returned home with his fresh child-like
nature uncorrupted, his constitution strengthened, his
lively and impressionable mind braced by the experience
of danger and the habits of duty, and quietly resumed
his reading under Captain Greville, who had moved from
the hall to a small house in the village.

Now, the education he had received, from first to last,
was less adapted prematurely to quicken his intellect and
excite his imagination than to warm his heart and elevate,
while it chastened, his moral qualities; for in Lady Mary
there was, amid singular sweetness of temper, a high cast
of character and thought. She was not what is commonly
called clever, and her experience of the world was limited,
compared to that of most women of similar rank who pass
their lives in the vast theater of London. But she became
superior, by a certain single-heartedness, which made truth
so habitual to her that the light in which she lived ren-
dered all objects around her clear. One who is always
true in the great duties of life is nearly always wise. And
Vernon, when he had fairly buried his faults, had felt a
noble shame for the excesses into which they had led him.
Gradually more and more wedded to his home, he dropped
his old companions. He set grave guard on his talk (his
habits now required no guard), lest any of the ancient
levity should taint the ears of his children. Nothing is
more common in parents than, their desire that their chil-
dren should escape their faults. We scarcely know our-
selves till we have children, and then, if we love them duly,
we look narrowly into failings that become vices, when
they serve as examples to the young.
The inborn gentleman with the native courage, and
spirit, and horror of trick and falsehood which belong to
that chivalrous abstraction, survived almost alone in Wer.

of generous sentiments and transparent truth. The tutor

was in harmony with the parents—a soldier every inch of
him—not a mere disciplinarian, yet with a profound sense
of duty and a knowledge that duty is to be found in atten-
tion to details. In inculcating the habit of subordination
so graceful to the young, he knew how to make himself
beloved, and, what is harder still, to be understood. The
soul of this poor soldier was white and unstained, as the
arms of a maiden knight; it was full of suppressed, but
lofty enthusiasm. He had been ill used, whether by Fate
or the Horse Guards–his career had been a failure, but
he was as loyal as if his hand held the field marshal's
truncheon and the garter bound his knee. He was above
all querulous discontent. From him, no less than from
his parents, Percival caught not only a spirit of honor
worthy the antiqua fides of the poets, but that peculiar
cleanliness of thought, if the expression may be used,
which belongs to the ideal of youthful chivalry. In mere
book-learning, Percival, as may be supposed, was not very
extensively read; but his mind, if not largely stored, had
a certain unity of culture which gave it stability and indi-
vidualized its operations. Travels, voyages, narratives of
heroic adventure, biographies of great men, had made the
favorite pasture of his enthusiasm. To this was added
the more stirring, and, perhaps, the more genuine order
of poets who make you feel and glow, rather than doubt
and ponder. He knew, at least, enough of Greek to enjoy
old Homer; and if he could have come but ill through a
college examination into AEschylus and Sophocles, he had
dwelt with fresh delight on the rushing storm of spears,

in the Seven before Thebes, and wept over the heroic
calamities of Antigone. In science, he was no adept; but
his clear, good sense, and quick appreciation of positive
truths, had led him easily through the elementary mathe-
matics, and his somewhat martial spirit had made him
delight in the old captain's lectures on military tactics.
Had he remained in the navy, Percival St. John would,
doubtless, have been distinguished. His talents fitted him
for straightforward manly action; and he had a generous
desire of distinction, vague, perhaps, the moment he was
taken from his profession, and curbed by his diffidence in
himself and his sense of deficiencies in the ordinary routine
of purely classical education. Still he had in him all the
elements of a true man—a man to go through life with a
firm step, and a clear conscience, and a gallant hope. Such
a man may not win fame, that is an accident; but he must
occupy no despicable place in the movement of the world.
It was at first intended to send Percival to Oxford, but
for some reason or other that design was abandoned.
Perhaps Lady Mary, overcautious, as mothers left alone
sometimes are, feared the contagion to which a young
man of brilliant expectations, and no studious turn, is
necessarily exposed in all places of miscellaneous resort.—
So Percival was sent abroad for two years, under the
guardianship of Captain Greville. On his return, at the
age of nineteen—the great world lay before him, and he
longed ardently to enter. For a year Lady Mary's fears
and fond anxieties detained him at Laughton; but, though
his great tenderness for his mother withheld Percival from

opposing her wishes by his own, this interval of inaction
affected visibly his health and spirits. Captain Greville, a
man of the world, saw the cause sooner than Lady Mary,
and one morning, earlier than usual, he walked up to the
Hall.
The captain, with all his deference to the sex, was a
plain man enough, when business was to be done. Like
his great commander, he came to the point in a few words.
“My dear Lady Mary, our boy must go to London—we
are killing him here.”
“Mr. Greville !” cried Lady Mary, turning pale and
putting aside her embroidery—“killing him?”
“Killing the man in him. I don't mean to alarm you—
I dare say his lungs are sound enough, and that his heart
would bear the sthenoscope to the satisfaction of the Col-
lege of Surgeons. But, my dear ma'am, Percival is to be
a man—it is the man you are killing by keeping him tied
to your apron-string.”
“Oh, Mr. Greville ! I am sure you don't wish to wound
me, but—”
“I beg ten thousand pardons. I am rough, but truth
is rough sometimes.”
“It is not for my sake,” said the mother, warmly, and
with tears in her eyes, “that I have wished him to be here.
If he is dull, can we not fill the house for him?”
“Fill a thimble, my dear Lady Mary—Percival should
have a plunge in the ocean.”
“But he is so young yet—that horrid London l—such
temptations—fatherless, too !”

“I have no fear of the result if Percival goes now while
his principles are strong, and his imagination not in-
flamed; but if we keep him here much longer against his
bent, he will learn to brood and to muse, write bad poetry
perhaps, and think the world withheld from him a thousand
times more delightful than it is. This very dread of tempt-
ation will provoke his curiosity, irritate his fancy, make
him imagine the temptation must be a very delightful
thing. For the first time in my life, ma'am, I have caught
him sighing over fashionable novels, and subscribing to
the Southampton Circulating Library. Take my word
for it, it is time that Percival should begin life, and swim
without corks.”
Lady Mary had a profound confidence in Greville's
judgment and affection for Percival, and like a sensible
woman she was aware of her own weakness. She remained
silent for a few moments, and then said, with an effort:
“You know how hateful London is to me now—how
unfit I am to return to the hollow forms of its society;
still, if you think it right, I will take a house for the season,
and Percival can still be under our eye.”
“No, ma'am, pardon me, that will be the surest way to
make him either discontented or hypocritical. A young
man of his prospects and temper can hardly be expected
to chime in with all our sober, old-fashioned habits. You
will impose on him—if he is to conform to our hours, and
notions, and quiet set—a thousand irksome restraints;
and what will be the consequence? In a year he will be
of age, and can throw us off altogether, if he pleases. I

know the boy:—don't seem to distrust him—he may be
trusted. You place the true constraint on temptation, when
you say to him, “We confide to you our dearest treasure—
your honor, your morals, your conscience, yourself!”
“But, at least, you will go with him, if it must be so,”
said Lady Mary, after a few timid arguments, from which,
one by one, she was driven.
“Il—what for 7—to be a jest of the young puppies he
must know—to make him ashamed of himself and me—
himself as a milksop, and me as a dry nurse.”
“But this was not so abroad l’
“Abroad, ma'am, I gave him full swing, I promise you;
and when we went abroad, he was three years younger.”
“But he is a mere child, still.”
“Child, Lady Maryl At his age, I had gone through
two sieges. There are younger faces than his at a mess-
room. Come, come l I know what you fear—he may
commit some follies; very likely. He may be taken in,
and lose some money—he can afford it, and he will get

world, like a saint of old, with his Bible in his hand and
no spot on his robe. Let him see fairly what is, not stay
here to dream of what is not. And when he's of age,
ma'am, we must get him an object—a pursuit;-start him
for the county, and make him serve the state; he will
understand that business pretty well. Tush! tush l what
is there to cry at?”
The captain prevailed. We don't say that his advice

would have been equally judicious for all youths of Per-
cival's age; but he knew well the nature to which he con-
fided; he knew well how strong was that young heart in
its healthful simplicity and instinctive rectitude; and he
appreciated its manliness not too highly when he felt that
all evident props and aids would be but irritating tokens
of distrust.
And thus, armed only with letters of introduction, his
mother's tearful admonitions, and Greville's experienced
warnings, Percival St. John was launched into London
life. After the first month or so, Greville came up to
visit him, do him sundry kind invisible offices among his
old friends, help him to equip his apartments, and mount
his stud; and, wholly satisfied with the results of his ex-
periment, returned in high spirits, with flattering reports
to the anxious mother.
But, indeed, the tone of Percival's letters would have
been sufficient to allay even maternal anxiety. He did
not write, as sons are too apt to do, short excuses for not
writing more at length, unsatisfactory compressions of de-
tails (exciting worlds of conjecture) into a hurried sen-
tence. Frank and overflowing, those delightful epistles
gave accounts fresh from the first impressions of all he
saw and did. There was a racy, wholesome gusto in his
enjoyment of novelty and independence. His balls and
his dinners, and his cricket at Lord's—his partners, and
his companions; his general gayety, his occasional ennui,
furnished ample materials to one who felt he was corre-

sponding with another heart, and had nothing to fear or
to conceal.
But about two months before this portion of our nar-
rative opens with the coronation, Lady Mary's favorite
sister, who had never married, and who, by the death of
her parents, was left alone in the worse than widowhood
of an old maid, had been ordered to Pisa, for a complaint
that betrayed pulmonary symptoms; and Lady Mary, with
her usual unselfishness, conquered both her aversion to
movement and her wish to be in reach of her son, to ac-
company abroad this beloved and solitary relative. Cap-
tain Greville was pressed into service as their joint cavalier.
And thus Percival's habitual intercourse with his two prin-
cipal correspondents received a temporary check.

AT noon the next day, Beck, restored to his grandeur,
was at the helm of his state; Percival was vainly trying
to be amused by the talk of two or three loungers who
did him the honor to smoke a cigar in his rooms; and
John Ardworth sat in his dingy cell in Gray's Inn, with a
pile of law books on the table, and the daily newspapers
carpeting a footstool of Hansard's Debates upon the floor
—no unusual combination of studies among the poorer
and more ardent students of the law, who often owe their
earliest, nor perhaps their least noble earnings, to employ-
ment in the empire of the Press. By the power of a mind
habituated to labor, and backed by a frame of remarkable
strength and endurance, Ardworth grappled with his arid
studies not the less manfully for a night mainly spent in a
printer's office, and stinted to less than four hours' actual
sleep. But that sleep was profound and refreshing as a
peasant's. The nights thus devoted to the Press (he was
employed in the sub-editing of a daily journal), the morn-
ings to the law, he kept distinct the two separate callings
with a stern subdivision of labor, which in itself proved
the vigor of his energy and the resolution of his will.

way, he had obtained a small fellowship at the small col
lege in which he had passed his academic career. Pre-
vious to his arrival in London, by contributions to political
periodicals, and a high reputation at that noble debating
society in Cambridge which has trained some of the most
eminent of living public men,* he had established a name
which was immediately useful to him in obtaining employ-
ment on the Press. Like most young men of practical
ability, he was an eager politician. The popular passion
of the day kindled his enthusiasm, and stirred the depths
of his soul with magnificent, though exaggerated, hopes
in the destiny of his race. He identified himself with the
people; his stout heart beat loud in their stormy cause.
His compositions, if they wanted that knowledge of men,
that subtle comprehension of the true state of parties,
that happy temperance in which the crowning wisdom of
statesmen must consist—qualities which experience alone
can give–excited considerable attention by their bold
eloquence and hardy logic. They were suited to the time.
But John Ardworth had that solidity of understanding
which betokens more than talent, and which is the usual
substratum of genius. He would not depend alone on

forget those brilliant competitors for the prizes of the University,

late Winthrop M. Praed.

the precarious and often unhonored toils of polemical
literature for that distinction on which he had fixed his
steadfast heart. Patiently he plodded on thrºugh the
formal drudgeries of his new profession, lighting up dull-
ness by his own acute comprehension, weaving complexities
into simple system by the grasp of an intellect inured to
generalize; and learning to love even what was most dis-
tasteful, by the sense of difficulty overcome, and the clearer
vision which every step through the mists, and up the hill,
gave of the land beyond. Of what the superficial are apt
to consider genius, John Ardworth had but little. He had
some imagination (for a true thinker is never without that),
but he had a very slight share of fancy. He did not flirt
with the Muses; on the granite of his mind, few flowers
could spring. His style, rushing and earnest, admitted at
times of a humor not without delicacy—though less deli-
cate than forcible and deep—but it was little adorned with
wit, and still less with poetry. Yet Ardworth had genius,
and genius ample and magnificent. There was genius in
that industrious energy so patient in the conquest of detail,
so triumphant in the perception of results. There was
genius in that kindly sympathy with mankind—genius in
that stubborn determination to succeed—genius in that
vivid comprehension of affairs, and the large interests of
the world — genius fed in the labors of the closet, and
evinced the instant he was brought in contact with men;
evinced in readiness of thought, grasp of memory, even in
a rough imperious manner, which showed him born to

speak strong truths, and in their name to struggle and
command.
Rough was this man often in his exterior, though really
gentle and kind hearted. John Ardworth had sacrificed
to no Graces; he would have thrown Lord Chesterfield
into a fever. Not that he was ever vulgar, for vulgarity
implies affectation of refinement; but he talked loud, and
laughed loud if the whim seized him, and rubbed his great
hands with a boyish heartiness of glee if he discomfited an
adversary in argument. Or, sometimes he would sit ab-
stracted and moody, and answer briefly and boorishly those
who interrupted him. Young men were mostly afraid of
him, though he wanted but fame to have a set of admiring
disciples. Old men censured his presumption, and recoiled
from the novelty of his ideas. Women alone liked and
appreciated him, as, with their finer insight into character,
they generally do, what is honest and sterling. Some
strange failings, too, had John Ardworth–some of the
usual vagaries and contradictions of clever men. As a
system, he was rigidly abstemious. For days together
he would drink nothing but water, eat nothing but bread,
or hard biscuit, or a couple of eggs: then, having wound
up some allotted portion of work, Ardworth would in-
dulge what he called a self-saturnalia—would stride off
with old college friends to an inn in one of the suburbs,
and spend, as he said triumphantly, “a day of blessed
debauch l’ Innocent enough, for the most part, the de-
bauch was;—consisting in cracking jests, stringing puns,
a fish dinner, perhaps, and an extra bottle or two of fiery

port. Sometimes this jollity, which was always loud and
uproarious, found its scene in one of the cider cellars ol
midnight taverns, but Ardworth's labors on the Press
made that latter dissipation extremely rare. These relax-
ations were always succeeded by a mien more than usually
grave, a manner more than usually curt and ungracious,
an application more than ever rigorous and intense. John
Ardworth was not a good-tempered man, but ne was the
best-natured man that ever breathed. He was like all
ambitious persons, very much occupied with self, and yet
it would have been a ludicrous misapplication of words to
call him selfish. Even the desire of fame which absorbed
him was but a part of benevolence—a desire to promote
justice and to serve his kind.
John Ardworth's shaggy brows were bent over his open
volumes, when his clerk entered noiselessly and placed on
his table a letter which the twopenny postman had just
delivered. With an impatient shrug of the shoulders,
Ardworth glanced toward the superscription; but his eye
became earnest, and his interest aroused, as he recognized
the hand. “Again!” he muttered, “what mystery is this?
Who can feel such interest in my fate?” He broke the
seal, and read as follows:
“Do you neglect my advice, or have you begun to act
upon it? Are you contented only with the slow process
of mechanical application, or will you make a triumphant
effort to abridge your apprenticeship, and emerge at once
into fame and power? I repeat that you fritter away your

A bank-note for 100l. dropped from the envelope, as
Ardworth silently replaced the letter on the table.
Thrice before had he received communications in the
same handwriting, and much to the same effect. Certainly,
to a mind of less strength, there would have been some-
thing very unsettling in those vague hints of a station
higher than he owned—of a future at variance with the
toilsome lot he had drawn from the urn; but after a single

glance over his lone position in all its bearings, and proba-
ble expectations, Ardworth's steady sense shook off the
slight disturbance such misty vaticinations had effected.
His mother's family was indeed unknown to him—he was
even ignorant of her maiden name. But that very ob-
scurity seemed unfavorable to much hope from such a
quarter. The connections with the rich and well-born are
seldom left obscure. From his father's family he had not
one expectation. More had he been moved by exhorta-
tions now generally repeated, but in a previous letter more
precisely detailed, viz., to appeal to the reading public in
his acknowledged person, and by some striking and original
work. This idea he had often contemplated and revolved;
but partly the necessity of keeping pace with the many ex-
igencies of the hour, had deterred him, and partly also the
conviction of his sober judgment, that a man does himself
no good at the bar, even by the most brilliant distinction
gained in discursive fields. He had the natural yearning
of the Restless Genius; and the Patient Genius (higher
power of the two) had suppressed the longing. Still, so
far, the whispers of his correspondent tempted and aroused.
But hitherto he had sought to persuade himself that the
communications thus strangely forced on him arose, per-
haps, from idle motives—a jest, it might be, of one of his
old college friends, or at best the vain enthusiasm of some
more credulous admirer. But the inclosure now sent to
him forbade either of these suppositions. Who that he
knew could afford so costly a jest, or so extravagant a
tribute? He was perplexed, and with his perplexity was

mixed a kind of fear. Plain, earnest, unromantic in the
common acceptation of the word, the mystery of this inter-
meddling with his fate; this arrogation of the license to
spy, the right to counsel, and the privilege to bestow,
gave him the uneasiness the bravest men may feel at noises
in the dark. That day he could apply no more—he could
not settle back to his Law Reports. He took two or three
unquiet turns up and down his smoke-dried cell, then
locked up the letter and inclosure, seized his hat, and
strode, with his usual lusty swinging strides, into the open
air.
But still the letter haunted him. “And if,” he said,
almost audibly, “if I were the heir to some higher station,
why then I might have a heart like idle men; and Helen
—beloved Helen l’- he paused, sighed, shook his rough
head, shaggy with neglected curls, and added—“As if even
then I could steal myself into a girl's good graces ! Man's
esteem I may command, though poor—woman's love could
I win, though rich! Pooh! pooh! every wood does not
make a Mercury; and, faith, the wood I am made of will
scarcely cut up into a lover.”
Nevertheless, though thus soliloquizing, Ardworth me-
chanically bent his way toward Brompton, and halted, half
ashamed of himself, at the house where Helen lodged with
her aunt. It was a building that stood apart from all the
cottages and villas of that charming suburb, half way down
a narrow lane, and inclosed by high melancholy walls, deep
set in which a small door, with the paint blistered and
weather-stained, gave unfrequented entrance to the de-

mesne. A woman servant of middle age, and starched
puritanical appearance, answered the loud ring of the bell,
and Ardworth seemed a privileged visitor, for she asked
him no question, as with a slight nod, and a smileless
stupid expression in a face otherwise comely, she led the
way across a paved path, much weed-grown, to the house.
That house itself had somewhat of a stern and sad ex-
terior. It was not ancient, yet it looked old from shab-
biness and neglect. The vine, loosened from the rusty
nails, trailed rankly against the wall, and fell in crawling
branches over the ground. The house had once been
whitewashed, but the color, worn off in great patches,
distained with damp, struggled here and there with the
dingy chipped bricks beneath. There was no peculiar
want of what is called “tenantable repair;” the windows
were whole, and doubtless the roof sheltered from the rain.
But the wood-work that incased the panes was decayed,
and house-leek covered the tiles. Altogether there was
that forlorn and cheerless aspect about the place, which
chills the visitor, he defines not why. And Ardworth
steadied his usual careless step, and crept, as if timidly,
up the creaking stairs.
On entering the drawing-room—it seemed at first de-
serted; but the eye searching round, perceived something
stir in the recess of a huge chair—set by the fireless
hearth. And from amid a mass of coverings a pale face
emerged, and a thin hand waved its welcome to the visitor.
Ardworth approached, pressed the hand, and drew a
seat near to the sufferer's

“You are better, I hope 7" he said cordially,–and yet
in a tone of more respect than was often perceptible in his
deep blunt voice.
“I am always the same,” was the quiet answer; “come
nearer still. Your visits cheer me.”
And as these last words were said, Madame Dalibard
raised herself from her recumbent posture, and gazed long
upon Ardworth's face of power and front of thought.
“You overfatigue yourself, my poor kinsman,” she said,
with a certain tenderness: “you look already too old for
your young years.”
“That's no disadvantage at the bar.”
“Is the bar your means, or your end?”
“My dear Madame Dalibard, it is my profession.”
“No, your profession is to rise. John Ardworth,” and
the low voice swelled in its volume; “you are bold, able,
and aspiring—for this, I love you—love you almost—al-
most as a mother. Your fate,” she continued, hurriedly,
“interests me; your energies inspire me with admiration.
Often I sit here for hours, musing over your destiny to be
—so that, at times, I may almost say that in your life I
live.”
Ardworth looked embarrassed, and, with an awkward
attempt at compliment, he began hesitatingly: “I should
think too highly of myself, if I could really believe that

had many conversations upon grave and subtle matters;

ward life and the mechanism of the social world,—tell me
then, and frankly, what do you think of me? Do you re-
gard me merely as your sex is apt to regard the woman
who aspires to equal men—a thing of borrowed phrases
and unsound ideas—feeble to guide and unskilled to teach 7
or do you recognize in this miserable body a mind of force
not unworthy yours, ruled by an experience larger than
your own?”
“I think of you,” answered Ardworth, frankly, “as the
most remarkable woman I have ever met. Yet, do not be
angry, I do not like to yield to the influence which you
gain over me when we meet. It disturbs my convictions
—it disquiets my reason—I do not settle back to my life
so easily after your breath has passed over it.”
“And yet,” said Lucretia, with a solemn sadness in her
voice, “that influence is but the natural power which cold
maturity exercises on ardent youth. It is my mournful
advantage over you that disquiets your happy calm. It is
my experience that unsettles the fallacies which you name
‘convictions.” Let this pass. I asked your opinion of
me, because I wished to place at your service all that
knowledge of life which I possess. In proportion as you
esteeru me, you will accept or reject my counsels.”
“I have benefited by them already. It is the tone that
you advised me to assume, that gave me an importance I
had not before, with that old formalist whose paper I
serve and whose prejudices I shock; it is to your criticisms

that I owe the more practical turn of my writings, and the
greater hold they have taken on the public.”
“Trifles indeed, these,” said Madame Dalibard, with a
half smile. “Let them at least induce you to listen to
me, if I propose to make your path more pleasant, yet
your ascent more rapid.”
Ardworth knit his brows, and his countenance assumed
an expression of doubt and curiosity. However, he only
replied, with a blunt laugh:
“You must be wise, indeed, if you have discovered a
royal road to distinction 1
“Ah, who can tell how hard it is to climb
The steep where Fame's proud temple shines afar l’
A more sensible exclamation than poets usually preface
with their whining 'Ah's' and “Oh's l’”
“What we are is nothing,” pursued Madame Dalibard;
“what we seem is much.”
Ardworth thrust his hands into his pockets and shook
his head. The wise woman continued, unheeding his dis-
sent from her premises.
“Everything you are taught to value has a likeness, and
it is that likeness which the world values. Take a man
out of the streets, poor and ragged, what will the world do
with him? Send him to the workhouse, if not to the jail.
Ask a great rainter to take that man's portrait, rags,
squalor, and all; and kings will bid for the picture. You
would thrust the man from your doors, you would place
the portrait in your palaces. It is the same with qualities:

the portrait is worth more than the truth. What is virtue
without character? But a man without virtue may thrive
on a character l What is genius without success? But
how often you bow to success without genius! John Ard-
worth, possess yourself of the portraits—win the character
—seize the success.”
“Madam,” exclaimed Ardworth, rudely, “this is hor-
rible [??
“Horrible it may be,” said Madame Dalibard, gently,
and feeling, perhaps, that she had gone too far: “but it is
the world's judgment. Seem, then, as well as be. You
have virtue, as I believe. Well, wrap yourself in it—in
your closet. Go into the world, and earn character. If
you have genius, let it comfort you. Rush into the crowd,
and get success.”
“Stop!” cried Ardworth; “I recognize you. How
could I be so blind? It is you who have written to me,
and in the same strain: you have robbed yourself—you,
poor sufferer, to throw extravagance into these strong
hands. And why? What am I to you?”
An expression of actual fondness softened Lucretia's
face, as she looked up at him and replied: “I will tell
you hereafter what you are to me. First, I confess that it
is I whose letters have perplexed, perhaps offended you.
The sum that I sent, I do not miss. I have more—will
ever have more at your command—never fear. Yes, I
wish you to go into the world, not as a dependent, but as
an equal to the world's favorites. I wish you to know
more of men than mere law-books teach you. I wish you

to be in men's mouths, create a circle that shall talk of
young Ardworth—that talk would travel to those who can
advance your career. The very possession of money in
certain stages of life gives assurance to the manner, gives
attraction to the address.”
“But,” said Ardworth, “all this is very well for some
favorite of birth and fortune; but for me—yet speak, and
plainly; you throw out hints that I am what I know not;
but something less dependent on his nerves and his brain,
than is plain John Ardworth. What is it you mean?”
Madame Dalibard bent her face over her breast, and
rocking herself in her chair, seemed to muse for some
moments before she answered.
“When I first came to England, some months ago, I
desired naturally to learn all the particulars of my family
and kindred, from which my long residence abroad had
estranged me. John Walter Ardworth was related to my
half-sister, to me he was but a mere connection. However,
I knew something of his history, yet I did not know that
he had a son. Shortly before I came to England, I
learned that one who passed for his son had been brought
up by Mr. Fielden, and from Mr. Fielden I have since
learned all the grounds for that belief, from which you
take the name of Ardworth.”
Lucretia paused a moment; and after a glance at the
impatient, wondering, and eager countenance that bent
intent upon her, she resumed :
“Your reputed father was, you are doubtless aware, of
reckless and extravagant habits. He had been put into

the army by my uncle, and he entered that profession with
the careless buoyancy of his sanguine nature. I remember
those days—that day ! Well, to return—where was I?—
Walter Ardworth had the folly to entertain strong notions
of politics. He dreamt of being a soldier, and yet per-
suaded himself to be a republican. His notions, so hate-
ful in his profession, got wind: he disguised nothing, he
neglected the portraits of things—Appearances. He ex-
cited the rancor of his commanding officer—for politics
then, more even than now, were implacable ministrants to
hate—occasion presented itself: during the short Peace of
Amiens he had been recalled. He had to head a detach-
ment of soldiers against some mob in Ireland, I believe;
he did not fire on the mob according to orders—so, at
least, it was said: John Walter Ardworth was tried by a
court-martial, and broke l But you know all this, per-

“My poor fatherl Only in part: I knew that he had

“But my uncle had left him a legacy—it brought no

drank or gamed, or lent or borrowed—what matters the
wherefore ?—he was in debt—he lived at last a wretched,
shifting, fugitive life—snatching bread where he could—
with the bailiffs at his heels—then, for a short time, we
met again.”
Lucretia's brow grew black as night, as her voice
dropped at that last sentence, and it was with a start that
she continued.
“In the midst of this hunted existence, Walter Ard-
worth appeared, late one night, at Mr. Fielden's with an
infant. He seemed, so says Mr. Fielden, ill, worn, and
haggard. He entered into no explanations with respect
to the child that accompanied him, and retired at once to
rest. What follows, Mr. Fielden, at my request, has
noted down. Read, and see what claim you have to the
honorable parentage so vaguely ascribed to you.”
As she spoke, Madame Dalibard opened a box on her
table, drew forth a paper in Fielden's writing, and placed
it in Ardworth's hand. After some preliminary statement
of the writer's intimacy with the elder Ardworth, and the
appearance of the latter at his house, as related by Madame
Dalibard, etc., the document went on thus:
“The next day, when my poor guest was still in bed,
my servant Hannah came to advise me that two persons
were without, waiting to see me. As is my wont, I bade
them be shown in. On their entrance (two rough farmer-
looking men they were, whom I thought might be coming

to hire my little pasture field), I prayed them to speak
low, as a sick gentleman was just overhead. Whereupon,
and without saying a word further, the two strangers made
a rush from the room, leaving me dumb with amazement;
in a few moments, I heard voices and a scuffle above. I
recovered myself, and thinking robbers had entered my
peaceful house, I called out lustily, when Hannah came in,
and we both, taking courage, went up stairs, and found
that poor Walter was in the hands of these supposed rob-
bers, who in truth were but bailiffs. They would not trust
him out of their sight for a moment. However, he took
it more pleasantly than I could have supposed possible;
prayed me in a whisper to take care of the child, and I
should soon hear from him again. In less than an hour
he was gone. Two days afterward, I received from him a
hurried letter, without address, of which this is the copy:
“‘DEAR FRIEND,--I slipt from the bailiffs, and here I
am in a safe little tavern in sight of the seal Mother

may return. But, meanwhile, my good old tutor, what will

Young Ardworth stopped from the lecture, and sighed
heavily. There seemed to him, in this letter, worse than
a mock gayety;—a certain levity and recklessness—which
jarred on his own high principles. And the want of affec-
tion for the child thus abandoned was evident—not one
fond word. He resumed the statement with a gloomy and
disheartened attention.
“This was all I heard from poor erring Walter for more
than three years, but I knew, in spite of his follies, that
his heart was sound at bottom " (the son's eye brightened
here, and he kissed the paper), “and the child was no
burden to us—we loved it, not only for Ardworth's sake,
but for its own, and for charity's, and Christ's. Ard-
worth's second letter was as follows:
“‘En iterum Crispinus/–I am still alive, and getting
on in the world—ay, and honestly too—I am no longer
spending heedlessly; I am saving for my debts, and I

equally valid, on Messrs. Drummond, for 250l. Repay
yourself what the boy has cost. Let him be educated to
get his own living—if clever, as a scholar or a lawyer—if
dull, as a tradesman. Whatever I may gain, he will have
his own way to make. I ought to tell you the story con-
nected with his birth, but it is one of pain and shame; and
on reflection, I feel that I have no right to injure him by
affixing to his early birth an opprobrium of which he him-
self is guiltless. If ever I return to England, you shall
know all, and by your counsels I will abide. Love to all
your happy family.
“Your grateful Friend and Pupil.”
, “From this letter I began to suspect that the poor boy
was probably not born in wedlock, and that Ardworth's
silence arose from his compunction. I conceived it best
never to mention this suspicion to John himself as he grew
up. Why should I afflict him by a doubt from which
his father shrunk, and which might only exist in my own
inexperienced and uncharitable interpretation of some
vague words? When John was fourteen, I received from
Messrs. Drummond a further sum of 500l., but without
any line from Ardworth, and only to the effect that Messrs.
Drummond were directed by a correspondent in Calcutta
to pay me the said sum on behalf of expenses incurred
for the maintenance of the child left to my charge by John
Walter Ardworth. My young pupil had been two years
at the university, when I received the letter of which this
is a copy:

“‘How are you?—still well—still happy?—let me hope
so I I have not written to you, dear old friend, but I have
not been forgetful of you—I have inquired of you through
my correspondents, and have learned, from time to time,
such accounts as satisfied my grateful affection for you. I
find that you have given the boy my name 7 Well, let him
bear it—it is nothing to boast of, such as it became in my
person; but, mind, I do not, therefore, acknowledge him
as my son. I wish him to think himself without parents,
without other aid in the career of life than his own indus-
try and talent—if talent he has. Let him go through the
healthful probation of toil—let him search for and find
independence. Till he is of age, 150l. per annum will be
paid quarterly to your account for him at Messrs. Drum-
monds'. If then, to set him up in any business or profession,
a sum of money be necessary, name the amount by a line,
signed A. B., Calcutta, to the care of Messrs. Drummond,

structions. But after that time all further supply from me
will cease. Do not suppose, because I send this from
India, that I am laden with rupees; all I can hope to
attain is a competence. That boy is not the only one who
has claims to share it. Even, therefore, if I had the wish
to rear him to the extravagant habits that ruined myself,
I have not the power. Yes!—let him lean on his own
strength. In the letter you send me, write fully of your
family, your sons, and write as to a man who can perhaps
help them in the world, and will be too happy thus in some
slight degree to repay all he owes you. You would smile

approvingly if you saw me now—a steady, money-getting
man, but still yours as ever.
“‘P. S.—Do not let the boy write to me, nor give him
this clew to my address.”
“On the receipt of this letter, I wrote fully to Ardworth
about the excellent promise and conduct of his poor ne-
glected son. I told him truly he was a son any father
might be proud of, and rebuked, even to harshness, Wal-
ter's unseemly tone respecting him. One's child is one's
child, however the father may have wronged the mother.
To this letter I never received any answer. When John
was of age, and had made himself independent of want,
by obtaining a college fellowship, I spoke to him about his
prospects. I told him that his father, though residing
abroad and for some reasons keeping himself concealed,
had munificently paid hitherto for his maintenance, and
would lay down what might be necessary to start him in
business, or perhaps place him in the army; but that his
father might be better pleased if he could show a love of
independence, and henceforth maintain himself. I knew
the boy I spoke to—John thought as I did, and I never
applied for another donation to the elder Ardworth. The
allowance ceased : John since then has maintained him-
self. I have heard no more from his father, though I have
written often to the address he gave me. I begin to fear
that he is dead. I once went up to town and saw one of
the heads of Messrs. Drummonds' firm—a very polite gen-
tleman, but he could give me no information, except that he

opeyed instructions from a correspondent at Calcutta–
one Mr. Macfarren. Whereon I wrote to Mr. Macfarren,
and asked him, as I thought very pressingly, to tell me all
he knew of poor Ardworth the elder. He answered shortly,
that he knew of no such person at all, and that A.B. was
a French merchant, settled in Calcutta, who had been dead
for above two years. I now gave up all hopes of any
further intelligence, and was more convinced than ever
that I had acted rightly in withholding from poor John
my correspondence with his father. The lad had been curi-
ous and inquisitive naturally, but when I told him that I
thought it my duty to his father to be so reserved, he for-
bore to press me. I have only to add, first, that by all
the inquiries I could make of the surviving members of
Walter Ardworth's family, it seemed their full belief that
he had never been married, and therefore I fear we must
conclude that he had no legitimate children, which may
account for, though it cannot excuse, his neglect; and
secondly, with respect to the sums received on dear John's
account—I put them all by, capital and interest, deducting
only the expense of his first year at Cambridge (the which
I could not defray, without injuring my own children), and
it all stands in his name at Messrs. Drummonds', wested in
the Three Per Cents. That I have not told him of this
was by my poor dear wife's advice; for she said, very sen-
sibly, and she was a shrewd woman on money matters, “If
he knows he has such a large sum all in the lump, who
knows but he may grow idle and extravagant, and spend
it at once, like his father before him; whereas, some time

particular purpose, then what a blessing it will be l’
“However, my dear madam, as you know the world
better than I do, you can now do as you please, both as to
communicating to John all the information herein con-
tained as to his parentage, and as to apprising him of the
large sum of which he is lawfully possessed.
“MATTHEW FIELDEN.
“P. S.–In justice to poor John Ardworth, and to show
that whatever whim he may have conceived about his own
child, he had still a heart kind enough to remember mine,
though Heaven knows I said nothing about them in my
letters, my eldest boy received an offer of an excellent
place in a West India merchant's house, and has got on
to be chief clerk, and my second son was presented to a
living of one hundred and seventeen pounds a year, by a
gentleman he never heard of. Though I never traced
these good acts to Ardworth, from whom else could they
come 7”

Ardworth put down the paper without a word; and
Lucretia, who had watched him while he read, was struck
with the self-control he evinced when he came to the end
of the disclosure. She laid her hand on his, and said:
“Courage l—you have lost nothing !”
“Nothing!” said Ardworth, with a bitter smile. “A
father's love and a father's name—nothing !”
“But,” exclaimed Lucretia, “is this man your father ?

Does a father's heart beat in one line of those hard sen-
tences? No, no; it seems to me probable—it seems to me
almost certain, that you are—” she stopped, and con-
tinued with a calmer accent, “near to my own blood. I
am now in England—in London—to prosecute the inquiry
built upon that hope. If so—if so—you shall—” Madaine
Dalibard again stopped abruptly, and there was something
terrible in the very exultation of her countenance. She
drew a long breath, and resumed, with an evident effort at
self-command—“If so, I have a right to the interest I feel
for you. Suffer me yet to be silent as to the grounds of
my belief, and—and—love me a little in the mean while !”
Her voice trembled, as if with rushing tears, at these last
words, and there was almost an agony in the tone in which
they were said, and in the gesture of the clasped hands she
held out to him.
Much moved (amid all his mingled emotions at the tale
thus made known to him) by the manner and voice of the
narrator, Ardworth bent down and kissed the extended
hands. Then he rose abruptly, walked to and fro the
room, muttering to himself—paused opposite the window
—threw it open, as for air, and, indeed, fairly gasped for
breath. When he turned round, however, his face was
composed, and folding his arms on his large breast with a
sudden action, he said aloud, and yet rather to himself
than to his listener:
“What matter, after all, by what name men call our
fathers! We ourselves make our own fate I Bastard or
noble, not a jot care I. Give me ancestors, I will not

disgrace them; raze from my lot even the very name of
father, and my sons shall have an ancestor in me!”
As he thus spoke, there was a rough grandeur in his
hard face and the strong ease of his powerful form. And
while thus standing and thus looking, the door opened,
and Warney walked in abruptly.
These two men had met occasionally at Madame Dali-
bard's, but no intimacy had been established between them.
Warney was formal and distant to Ardworth, and Ard-
worth felt a repugnance to Warney. With the instinct of
sound, sterling, weighty natures, he detected at once, and.
disliked heartily, that something of gaudy, false, exag-
gerated, and hollow, which pervaded Gabriel Warney's
talk and manner—even the trick of his walk and the cut
of his dress. And Ardworth wanted that boyish and
beautiful luxuriance of character which belonged to Perci-
val St. John, easy to please and to be pleased, and ex-
panding into the warmth of admiration for all talent and
all distinction. For art, if not the highest, Ardworth
cared not a straw: it was nothing to him that Warney
painted and composed, and ran showily through the jargon
of literary babble, or toyed with the puzzles of unsatisfying
metaphysics. He saw but a charlatan, and he had not
yet learned from experience what strength and what danger
lie hid in the boa parading its colors in the sun, and shift-
ing, in the sensual sportiveness of its being, from bough to
bough.
Warney halted in the middle of the room, as his eye
rested first on Ardworth, and then glanced toward Madame

Dalibard. But Ardworth, jarred from his reverie or re-
solves by the sound of a voice discordant to his ear at all
times, especially in the mood which then possessed him,
scarcely returned Warney's salutation, buttoned his coat
over his chest, seized his hat, and upsetting two chairs
and very considerably disturbing the gravity of a round
table, forced his way to Madame Dalibard, pressed her
hand, and said, in a whisper, “I shall see you again soon,”
and vanished.
Warney, smoothing his hair with fingers that shone with
rings, slid into the seat next Madame Dalibard, which
Ardworth had lately occupied, and said, “If I were a
Clytemnestra, I should dread an Orestes in such a son!”
Madame Dalibard shot toward the speaker one of the
sidelong suspicious glances which of old had characterized
Lucretia, and said:
“Clytemnestra was happy! The Furies slept to her
crime, and haunted but the avenger.”
“Hist!” said Warney.
The door opened, and Ardworth reappeared.
“I quite forgot, what I half came to know.—How is
Helen? Did she return home safe?”
“Safe—yes!”
“Dear girl—I am glad to hear it! Where is she?
Not gone to those Mivers' again! I am no aristocrat,
but why should one couple together refinement and vul-
garity?”
“Mr. Ardworth,” said Madame Dalibard, with haughty
coldness, “my niece is under my care, and you will permit

me to judge for myself how to discharge the trust. Mr
Mivers is her own relation—a nearer one than you are.”
Not at all abashed by the rebuke, Ardworth said, care-
lessly, “Well, I shall talk to you again on that subject
Meanwhile, pray give my love to her—Helen, I mean *
Madame Dalibard half rose in her chair, then sunk back
again, motioning with her hand to Ardworth to approach.
Warney rose and walked to the window, as if sensible that
something was about to be said not meant for his ear.
When Ardworth was close to her chair, Madame Dali-
bard grasped his hand with a vigor that surprised him,
and drawing him nearer still, whispered as he bent down:
“I will give Helen your love, if it is a cousin's—or, if
you will, a brother's love. Do you intend—do you feel
—another, a warmer love? Speak, sir!” and drawing
suddenly back, she gazed on his face, with a stern and
menacing expression, her teeth set, and the lips firmly
pressed together.
Ardworth, though a little startled, and half angry,
answered with the low ironical laugh, not uncommon to
him, “Pish l you ladies are apt to think us men much
greater fools than we are. A briefless lawyer is not very
inflammable tinder. Yes, a cousin's love—quite enough.
Poor little Helen! time enough to put other notions into

handsome like herself!”

bending over a flower-bed in the neglected garden. He
paused, irresolute, a moment. “No,” he muttered to him-
self; “no, I am fit company only for myself! A long
walk into the fields, and then—away with these mists
round the Past and Future; the Present at least is mine!”

“AND what,” said Warney—“what, while we are pursu-
ing a fancied clew, and seeking to provide first a name,
and then a fortune for this young lawyer—what steps have
you really taken to meet the danger that menaces me—to
secure, if our inquiries fail, an independence for yourself?
Months have elapsed, and you have still shrunk from ad-
vancing the great scheme upon which we built when the
daughter of Susan Mainwaring was admitted to your
hearth.”
“Why recall me, in these rare moments when I feel
myself human still—why recall me back to the nethermost
abyss of revenge and crime? Oh! let me be sure that I

cause I was born a woman—had woman's poor passions
and infirm weakness—that I am what I am. I would trans-
fer myself into the soul of man—man who has the strength
to act, and the privilege to rise. Into the bronze of man's
nature I would pour the experience which has broken, with
its fierce elements, the puny vessel of clay. Yes, Gabriel,
in return for all I have done and sacrificed for you, I ask
but co-operation in that one hope of my shattered and
storm-beat being. Bear—forbear—await—risk not that
hope by some wretched peddling crime, which will bring
on us both detection—some wanton revelry in guilt, which
is not worth the terror that treads upon its heels.”
“You forget,” answered Warney, with a kind of sub-
missive sullenness, for whatever had passed between these
two persons in their secret and fearful intimacy, there was
still a power in Lucretia, surviving her fall amid the fiends,
that impressed Warney with the only respect he felt for
man or woman—“you forget strangely the nature of our
elaborate and master project, when you speak of ‘peddling
crime,” or ‘wanton revelry’ in guilt You forget, too,
how every hour that we waste deepens the peril that sur-
rounds me, and may sweep from your side the sole com-
panion that can aid you in your objects—nay, without
whom they must wholly fail. Let me speak first of that
most urgent danger, for your memory seems short and
troubled, since you have learned only to hope the recovery
of your son. If this man, Stubmore, in whom the trust
created by my uncle's will is now vested—once comes to

you again and again that my forgery on the bank will be
detected, and that transportation will be the smallest
penalty inflicted; part of the forgery, as you know, was
committed on your behalf, to find the moneys necessary
for the research for your son—committed on the clear
understanding that our project on Helen should repay me
—should enable me, perhaps undetected, to restore the
sums illegally abstracted, or, at the worst, to confess to
Stubmore, whose character I well know—that oppressed
by difficulties, I had yielded to temptation—that I had
forged his name (as I had forged his father's) as an au-
thority to sell the capital from the bank, and that now, in
replacing the money, I repaid my error, and threw myself
on his indulgence—on his silence. I say, that I know
enough of the man to know that I should be thus cheaply
saved, or at the worst, I should have but to strengthen
his compassion by a bribe to his avarice. But if I cannot
replace the money, I am lost.”

address. By to-morrow he shall be on the track. I have
stinted myself to save from the results of the last forgery
the gold to whet his zeal. For the rest, as I have said,
your design involves, the removal of two lives. Already,
over the one more difficult to slay, the shadow creeps and
the pall hangs. I have won, as you wished and as was
necessary, young St. John's familiar acquaintance; when
the hour comes, he is in my hands.”
Lucretia smiled sternly : “Sol” she said, between her
ground teeth, “the father forbade me the house that was
my heritagel I have but to lift a finger and breathe a
word, and, desolate as I am, I thrust from that home the
son 1 The spoiler left me the world—I leave his son the
grave!”
“But,” said Warney, doggedly pursuing his dreadful
object, “why force me to repeat that his is not the only
life between you and your son's inheritance 7 St. John
gone, Helen still remains. And what, if your researches
fail, are we to lose the rich harvest which Helen will yield
us—a harvest you reap with the same sickle which gathers
in your revenge 7 Do you no longer see in Helen's face
the features of her mother? Is the perfidy of William
Mainwaring forgotten or forgiven 7"
“Gabriel Warney,” said Lucretia, in a hollow and tremu-
lous voice, “when in that hour in which my whole being
was revulsed, and I heard the cord snap from the anchor,
and saw the demons of the storm gather round my bark—
when, in that hour, I stooped calmly down and kissed my

rival's brow, I murmured an oath, which seemed not in-
spired by my own soul, but by an influence henceforth
given to my fate—I vowed that, the perfidy dealt to me
should be repaid—I vowed that the ruin of my own ex-
istence should fall on the brow which I kissed. I vowed
that if shame and disgrace were to supply the inheritance
I had forfeited, I would not stand alone amid the scorn of
the pitiless world. In the vision of my agony, I saw, afar,
the altar dressed, and the bride-chamber prepared, and I
breathed my curse, strong as prophecy, on the marriage-
hearth and the marriage-bed. Why dream, then, that I
would rescue the loathed child of that loathed union from
your grasp?—But is the time come 7 Yours may be come

Something so awful there was in the look of this ac-
complice—so intense in the hate of her low voice—that
Warney, wretch as he was, and contemplating at that very
hour the foulest and most hideous guilt, drew back, ap-

tone, but softened only by the anguish of despair.

breast a living outrage on all her laws! Was I not justi-
fied in the desire of retribution ? Every step that I fell,
every glance that I gave to the gulf below, increased but
in me the desire for revenge. All my acts had flowed
from one fount—should the stream roll pollution, and the
fount spring pure?”
“You have had your revenge on your rival and her
husband.”
“I had it, and I passed on 1" said Lucretia with nostrils
dilated as with haughty triumph. “They were crushed,
and I suffered them to live Nay, when, by chance, I
heard of William Mainwaring's death, I bowed down my
head, and I almost think I wept. The old days came
back upon me. Yes, I wept! But I had not destroyed
their love. No, no! there, I had miserably failed. A
pledge of that love lived. I had left their hearth barren;
Fate sent them a comfort, which I had not foreseen. And
suddenly my hate returned, my wrongs rose again, my ven-
geance was not sated. The love that had destroyed more
than my life—my soul, rose again and cursed me in the
face of Helen. The oath which I took when I kissed my
rival's brow, demanded another prey when I kissed the
child of those nuptials.”
“You are prepared at last, then, to act 7” cried War-
ney, in a tone of savage joy.
At that moment, close under the window, rose, sudden
and sweet, the voice of one singing—the young voice of
Helen. The words were so distinct that they came to the
ears of the dark-plotting and guilty pair. In the song

the consciences of those who heard; yet in the extreme
and touching purity of the voice, and in the innocence of

so fearfully their own thoughts and minds, that they sate

“Ye fade, yet still how sweet, ye Flowers
Your scent outlives the bloom
So, Father, may my mortal hours
Grow sweeter toward the tomb!
“In withered leaves a healing cure
The simple gleaners find;
So may our withered hopes endure
In virtues left behind!
“Oh, not to me be vainly given
The lesson ye bestow,
Of thoughts that rise in sweets to Heaven,
And turn to use below.”
The song died, but still the listeners remained silent, till
at length, shaking off the effect with his laugh of discord-
ant irony, Warney said:
“Sweet innocence, fresh from the nursery ! Would it
not be sin to suffer the world to mar it? You hear the
prayer—why not grant it, and let the flower ‘turn to use
below'?”

THE LAWYER AND THE BODY-SNATCHER.
THAT same evening, Beck, according to appointment,
met Percival, and showed him the dreary-looking house
which held the fair stranger who had so attracted his
youthful fancy. And Percival looked at the high walls,
with the sailor's bold desire for adventure, while confused
visions reflected from plays, operas, and novels, in which
scaling walls with rope ladders and dark lanterns was
represented as the natural avocation of a lover, flitted
across his brain;—and certainly he gave a deep sigh, as
his common sense plucked him back from such romance.
However, having now ascertained the house, it would be
easy to learn the name of its inmates, and to watch or
make his opportunity. As slowly and reluctantly he
walked back to the spot where he had left his cabriolet,
he entered into some desultory conversation with his
strange guide; and the pity he had before conceived for
Beck increased upon him as he talked and listened. This
benighted mind, only illumined by a kind of miserable
astuteness, and that “cunning of the belly” which is born
of want to engender avarice—this joyless temperament—
this age in youth—this living reproach, rising up from the

stones of London against our social indifference to the
souls which wither and rot under the hard eyes of science
and the deaf ears of wealth, had a pathos for his lively
sympathies and his fresh heart.
“If ever you want a friend, come to me,” said St. John,
abruptly
The sweeper stared, and a gleam of diviner nature, a
ray of gratitude and unselfish devotion, darted through
the fog and darkness of his mind. He stood, with his hat
off, watching the wheels of the cabriolet, as it bore away
the happy child of fortune, and then shaking his head,
as at some puzzle that perplexed and defied his compre-
hension, strode back to the town and bent his way home-
ward.
Between two and three hours after Percival thus parted
from the sweeper, a man whose dress was little in accord-
ance with the scene in which we present him, threaded his
way through a foul labyrinth of alleys in the worst part of
St. Giles's: a neighborhood, indeed, carefully shunned at
dusk, by wealthy passengers; for here dwelt not only
Penury in its grimmest shape, but the desperate and dan-
gerous Guilt, which is not to be lightly encountered in its
haunts and domiciles. Here children imbibe vice with
their mother's milk. Here Prostitution, commencing with
childhood, grows fierce and sanguinary in the teens, and
leagues with theft and murder. Here slinks the pickpocket
—here emerges the burglar—here skulks the felon. Yet
all about and all around, here, too, may be found virtue
in its rarest and noblest form—virtue outshining circum-

stance and defying temptation—the virtue of utter poverty,
which groans and yet sins not. So interwoven are these
webs of penury and fraud, that in one court your life is
not safe; but turn to the right hand, and in the other,
you might sleep safely in that worse than Irish shieling,
though your pockets were full of gold. Through these
haunts the ragged and penniless may walk unfearing, for
they have nothing to dread from the lawless—more, per-
haps, from the law; but the wealthy, the respectable, the
spruce, the dainty, let them beware the spot, unless the
policeman is in sight or day is in the skies!
As this passenger, whose appearance, as we have im-
plied, was certainly not that of a denizen, turned into one
of the alleys, a rough hand seized him by the arm, and
suddenly a group of girls and tatterdemalions issued from
a house, in which the lower shutters, unclosed, showed a
light burning, and surrounded him with a hoarse whoop.
The passenger whispered a word in the ear of the grim
blackguard who had seized him, and his arm was instantly
released.
“Hist! a pal: he has the catch,” said the blackguard,
surlily. The group gave way, and by the light of the
clear starlit skies, and a single lamp hung at the entrance
of the alley, gazed upon the stranger. But they made no
effort to detain him; and as he disappeared in the distant
shadows, hastened back into the wretched hostelry, where
they had been merry-making. Meanwhile, the stranger
gained a narrow court, and stopped before a house in one
of j's angles—a house taller than the rest—so much taller

than the rest that it had the effect of a tower; you would
have supposed it (perhaps rightly) to be the last remains
of some ancient building of importance, around which, as
population thickened and fashion changed, the huts below
it had insolently sprung up. Quaint and massive pilasters,
black with the mire and soot of centuries, flanked the deep-
set door; the windows were heavy with mullions and tran-
soms, and strongly barred in the lower floor; but few of
the panes were whole, and only here and there had any
attempts been made to keep out the wind and rain by rags,
paper, old shoes, old hats, and other ingenious contriv-
ances. Beside the door was conveniently placed a row of
some ten or twelve bell-pulls, appertaining no doubt to the
various lodgments into which the building was subdivided
The stranger did not seem very familiar with the appur.
tenances of the place. He stood in some suspense as to
the proper bell to select, but at last guided by a brass plate
annexed to one of the pulls, which, though it was too dark
to decipher the inscription, denoted a claim to superior
gentility than the rest of that nameless class, he hazarded
a tug, which brought forth a larum loud enough to startle
the whole court from its stillness.
In a minute, or less, the casement in one of the upper
stories opened, a head peered forth, and one of those voices
peculiar to low debauch—raw, cracked, and hoarse—called
out, “Who waits?”
“Is it you, Grabman?” asked the stranger, dubiously.
“Yes; Nicholas Grabman, attorney-at-law, sir, at your
service: and vour name 7” -

“Jason,” answered the stranger.
“Ho! there—hol Beck,” cried the cracked voice to
some one within; “go down and open the door.”
In a few moments the heavy portal swung and creaked,
and yawned sullenly, and a gaunt form, half undressed,
with an inch of a farthing rushlight, glimmering through
a battered lantern, in its hand, presented itself to Jason.
The last eyed the ragged porter sharply.
“Do you live here?”
“Yes,” answered Beck, with the cringe habitual to him.
“Hup the ladder, with the rats, drat'em.”
“Well, lead on—hold up the lantern; a devil of a dark
place this!” grumbled Jason, as he nearly stumbled over
sundry broken chattels, and gained a flight of rude, black,
broken stairs, that creaked under his tread.
“’St! 'st!” said Beck, between his teeth, as the stranger,
halting at the second floor, demanded, in no gentle tones,
whether Mr. Grabman lived in the chimney-pots.
“’Stil 'st—don't make such a rumpus, or No. 7 will be
at you.”
“What do I care for No. 7 ? and who the devil is
No. 7 ?”
“A body-snatcher!” whispered Beck, with a shudder.
“He’s a dillicut sleeper, and can't abide having his night's
rest sp'ilt. And he's the houtrageoustest great cretur,
when he's hup in his tantrums—it makes your air stand
on ind to ear him!”
“I should like very much to hear him, then,” said the
stranger curiously. And while he spoke, the door of No

7 opened abruptly. A huge head, covered with matted
hair, was thrust for a moment through the aperture, and
two dull eyes, that seemed covered with a film, like that of
the birds which feed on the dead, met the stranger's bold
sparkling orbs.
“Hell and fury!” bawled out the voice of this ogre, like
a clap of near thunder, “if you two keep—tramp, tramp
there, close at my door, I'll make you meat for the sur-
geons—b— you!”
“Stop a moment, my civil friend,” said the stranger,
advancing; “just stand where you are ; I should like to
make a sketch of your head.”
That head protruded farther from the door, and with it
an enormous bulk of chest and shoulder. But the ad-
venturous visitor was not to be daunted. He took out,
very coolly, a pencil, and the back of a letter, and began
his sketch.
The body-snatcher stared at him an instant, in mute
astonishment; but that operation and the composure of
the artist were so new to him, that they actually inspired
him with terror. He slunk back—banged-to the door:
and the stranger, putting up his implements, said, with a
disdainful laugh, to Beck, who had slunk away into a
corner:
“No. 7 knows well how to take care of No. 1. Lead
on, and be quick then l’”
As they continued to mount, they heard the body-
snatcher growling and blaspheming in his den, and the

landing-place, he took breath, threw open a door, and
Jason, pushing him aside, entered first.
The interior of the room bespoke better circumstances
than might have been supposed from the approach: the
floor was covered with sundry scraps of carpets, formerly
of different hues and patterns, but mellowed by time into
one threadbare mass of grease and canvas. There was a
good fire on the hearth, though the night was warm: there
were sundry volumes piled round the walls, in the binding
peculiar to law books; in a corner stood a tall desk, of
the fashion used by clerks, perched on tall slim legs, and
companioned by a tall slim stool. On a table before the
fire were scattered the remains of the nightly meal; broiled
bones, the skeleton of a herring; and the steam rose from
a tumbler containing a liquid colorless as water, but poi.
sonous as gin.
The room was squalid and dirty, and bespoke mean
and slovenly habits, but it did not bespeak penury and
want; it had even an air of filthy comfort of its own—the
comfort of the swine in its warm sty. The occupant of
the chamber was in keeping with the localities. Figure to
yourself a man of middle height—not thin, but void of all
muscular flesh, bloated, puffed, unwholesome. He was
dressed in a gray flannel gown and short breeches, the
stockings wrinkled and distained, the feet in slippers. The
stomach was that of a portly man, the legs those of a
skeleton; the cheeks full and swollen, like a plow-boy's,
but livid, bespeckled, of a dull lead-color, like a patient in
the dropsy The head, covered in patches with thin, yel.

lowish hair, gave some promise of intellect, for the fore-
head was high, and appeared still more so from partial
baldness; the eyes, imbedded in fat and wrinkled skin,
were small and lusterless, but they still had that acute
look which education and ability communicate to the hu-
man orb; the mouth most showed the animal—full-lipped,
—coarse, and sensual; while behind one of two great ears
stuck a pen.
You see before you, then, this slatternly figure—slip-
shod, half clothed, with a sort of shabby-demigentility
about it—half ragamuffin, half clerk; while, in strong con-
trast, appeared the new-comer, scrupulously neat, new—
with bright black satin stock, coat cut jauntily to the waist,
varnished boots, kid gloves, and trim moustache.
Behind this sleek and comely personage, on knock-knees,
in torn shirt open at the throat, with apathetic, listless,
unlighted face, stood the lean and gawky Beck.
“Set a chair for the gentleman,” said the inmate of the
chamber to Beck, with a dignified wave of the hand.
“How do you do, Mr.—Mr.—humph—Jason 7—how
do you do?—always smart and blooming—the world
thrives with you.” *
“The world is a farm, that thrives with all who till it
properly, Grabman,” answered Jason, dryly; and with his
handkerchief he carefully dusted the chair, on which he
then daintily deposited his person.
“But who is your Ganymede—your valet, your gentle
man usher?”

after his day's work, goes an errand now and then. Make
yourself scarce, Beck!—Anatomy, vanish l’
Beck grinned, nodded, pulled hard at a flake of his hair,
and closed the door.
“One of your brotherhood, that?” asked Jason, care-
lessly.
“He, oafl—no,” said Grabman, with profound con-
tempt in his sickly visage. “He works for his bread 1–
instinct!—turnspits, and truffle-dogs, and some silly men
have it!—What an age since we met—shall I mix you a
tumbler?”
“You know I never drink your vile spirits; though in
Champagne and Bordeaux I am any man's match.”
“And how the devil do you keep old black thoughts out
of your mind by those washy potations?”
“Old black thoughts l—of what?”
“Of black actions, Jason. We have not met since you
paid me for recommending the nurse who attended your
uncle in his last illness?”
“Well, poor coward ”
Grabman knit his thin eyebrows, and gnawed his blub-
ber lip:
“I am no coward, as you know.”
“Not when a thing is to be done, but after it is done.
You brave the substance, and tremble at the shadow. I
dare say you see ugly goblins in the dark, Grabman.”
“Ay, ay; but it is no use talking to you. You call
yourself Jason, because of your yellow hair, or your love

for the golden fleece; but your old comrades call you Bat-
tlesnake; and you have its blood, as its venom.”
“And its charm, man,” added Jason, with a strange
smile, that, though hypocritical and constrained, had yet a
certain softness, and added greatly to the comeliness of
features which many might call beautiful and all would
allow to be regular and symmetrical. “I shall find at
least ten love-letters on my table, when I go home. But
enough of these fopperies: I am here on business.”
“Law, of course; I am your man—who's the victim 7”
and a hideous grin on Grabman's face contrasted the sleek
smile that yet lingered upon his visitor's. -
“No ; something less hazardous, but not less lucrative
than our old practices. This is a business that may bring
you hundreds, thousands—that may take you from this
hovel, to speculate at the West End—that may change
your gin into Lafitte, and your herring into venison—that
may lift the broken attorney again upon the wheel,—again
to roll down, it may be; but that is your affair.”
“’Fore Gad, open the case,” cried Grabman, eagerly,
and, showing aside the ignoble relics of his supper, he
leaned his elbows on the table and his chin on his damp
palms, while eyes, that positively brightened into an ex-
pression of greedy and relentless intelligence, were fixed
upon his visitor.
“The case runs thus,” said Jason: “Once upon a time
there lived, at an old house in Hampshire, called Laugh-
ton, a wealthy baronet named St. John. He was a bache-
lor—his estates at his own disposal. He had two nieces

and a more distant kinsman. His eldest niece lived with
him—she was supposed to be destined for his heiress;
circumstances, needless to relate, brought upon this girl
her uncle's displeasure — she was dismissed his house.
Shortly afterward he died, leaving to his kinsman—a Mr.
Vernon—his estates, with remainder to Vernon's issue,
and, in default thereof—first, to the issue of the younger
niece, next to that of the elder and disinherited one. The
elder married, and was left a widow, without children.
She married again, and had a son. Her second husband,
for some reason or other, conceived ill opinions of his wife.
In his last illness (he did not live long) he resolved to
punish the wife by robbing the mother. He sent away
the son—nor have we been able to discover him since. It
is that son whom you are to find.”

for the trace. This husband—did I tell you his name?—
no–Alfred Braddell—had one friend more intimate than
the rest—John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a
ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs. To
this man we have ſately had reason to believe that the
child was given. Ardworth, however, was shortly after-
ward obliged to fly his creditors. We know that he went
to India, but if residing there, it must have been under
some new name, and we fear he is now dead. All our

Before he went abroad, he left with his old tutor a child
corresponding in age to that of Mrs. Braddell's. In this
child she thinks she recognizes her son. All that you

that child in his keeping, to Matthew Fielden's house,

“What is the mother's maiden name 7”
“Her maiden name was Clavering; she was married
under that of Dalibard, her first husband.”
“And,” said Grabman, looking over the notes in the
paper given to him, “it is at Liverpool that the husband
died, and whence the child was sent away?”

“It is so; to Liverpool you will go first. I tell you
fairly, the task is difficult, for hitherto it has foiled me. I
knew but one man who, without flattery, could succeed;
and therefore I spared no pains to find out Nicholas Grab-
man. You have the true ferret's faculty; you, too, are
a lawyer, and snuff evidence in every breath. Find up a
son—a legal son—a son to be shown in a court of law,
and the moment he steps into the lands, and the Hall of
Laughton, you have 5000l.”
“Can I have a bond to that effect 7”
“My bond, I fear, is worth no more than my word.
Trust to the last;-if I break it, you know enough of my
secrets to hang me!” -
“Don’t talk of hanging—I hate that subject. But stop

leave no heir—this other sister continue single, or prove
barren?”
“Oh, true ! he, Mr. Vernon, who by will took the name
of St. John, he left issue—but only one son still survives,
a minor and unmarried. The sister, too, left a daughter;
both are poor sickly creatures—their lives not worth a
straw. Never mind them. You find Vincent Braddell,
and he will not be long out of his property, nor you out of
your 5000l.! You see, under these circumstances, a bond
might become dangerous evidence 1”
Grabman emitted a fearful and tremulous chuckle—a
laugh, like the laugh of a superstitious man when you talk
to him of ghosts and church-yards. He chuckled—and his
hair bristled ! But, after a pause, in which he seemed to

you are a strange man, Jason, you love your joke—I have
nothing to do except to find out this ultimate remainder-
man—mind that l”
“Perfectly; nothing like subdivision of labor.”
“The search will be expensive!”
“There is oil for your wheels,” answered Jason, putting
a note-book into his confidant's hands. “But mind, you
waste it not; no tricks, no false play, with me; you know
Jason, or if you like the name better, you know the Rat-
tlesnake l’”
“I will account for every penny,” said Grabman, eagerly,
and clasping his hands, while his pale face grew livid.
“I do not doubt it, my quill-driver. Look sharp, start
to-morrow! Get thyself decent clothes, be sober, cleanly,
and respectable. Act as a man who sees before him five
thousand pounds. And now light me down stairs.”
With the candle in his hand, Grabman stole down the
rugged steps, even more timorously than Beck had as-
cended them, and put his finger to his mouth as they came
in the dread vicinity of No. 7. "But Jason, or rather Gabriel
Warney, with that fearless, reckless bravado of temper,
which, while causing half his guilt, threw at times a false
glitter over its baseness, piqued by the cowardice of his
comrade—gave a lusty kick at the closed door, and shouted
out—“Old Grave-stealer, come out, and let me finish your
picture. Out, out!—I say—out !” Grabman left the
candle on the steps, and made but three bounds to his own
room.

At the third shout of his disturber, the Resurrection-
man threw open his door violently, and appeared at the
gap—the upward flare of the candle showing the deep
lines plowed in his hideous face, and the immense strength
of his gigantic trunk and limbs. Slight, fair, and delicate
as he was, Warney eyed him deliberately, and trembled
not.
“What do you want with me?” said the terrible voice,
tremulous with rage.
“Only to finish your portrait, as Pluto. He was the
god of Hell, you know !”
The next moment, the vast hand of the ogre hung like
a great cloud over Gabriel Warney. This last, ever on
his guard, sprang aside, and the light gleamed on the steel
of a pistol. “Hands off l—or 37
The click of the pistol-cock finished the sentence. The
ruffian halted. A glare of disappointed fury gave a mo-
mentary luster to his dull eyes. “P'raps I shall meet
you agin one o' these days or nights, and I shall know ye
in ten thousand.”
“Nothing like a bird in the hand, Master Grave-stealer!
Where can we ever meet again?”

quicker beat of the heart before. But the image presented
to his irritable fancy (always prone to brood over terrors)
—the image of that companion—chained to him night
and day—suddenly quelled his courage—the image stood
before him palpably like the Oulos Oneiros — the Evil
Dream of the Greeks.
He breathed loud. The body-stealer's stupid sense saw
that he had produced the usual effect of terror, which
gratified his brutal self-esteem; he retreated slowly, inch
by inch, to the door, followed by Warney's appalled and
staring eye—and closed it with such violence that the
candle was extinguished.
Warney, not daring—yes, literally not daring—to call
aloud to Grabman for another light, crept down the dark
stairs with hurried, ghost-like steps—and, after groping at
the door-handle with one hand, while the other grasped
his pistol with a strain of horror, he succeeded at last in
winning access to the street, and stood a moment to collect
himself, in the open air—the damps upon his forehead, and
his limbs trembling like one who has escaped by a hair-
breadth the crash of a falling house.

THE RAPE OF THE MATTRESS.
THAT Mr. Grabman slept calmly that night, is probable
enough, for his gin-bottle was empty the next morning;
and it was with eyes more than usually heavy that he
dozily followed the movements of Beck, who, according to
- custom, opened the shutters of the little den adjoining his
sitting-room, brushed his clothes, made his fire, set on the
kettle to boil, and laid his breakfast-things, preparatory
to his own departure to the duties of the day. Stretch-
ing himself, however, and shaking off slumber, as the re-
membrance of the enterprise he had undertaken glanced
pleasantly across him, Grabman sat up in his bed, and said
in a voice that if not maudlin was affectionate, and if not
affectionate was maudlin :
“Beck, you are a good fellow ! You have faults—you
are human; humanum est errare, which means that you
sometimes scorch my muffins. But, take you all in all, you
are a kind creature. Beck, I am going into the country
for some days. I shall leave my key in the hole in the
wall—you know; take care of it when you come in. You
were out late last night, my poor fellow. Very wrong !
Look well to yourself, or who knows, you may be clutched

to think of that Jason's fool-hardiness. But he's the worse
devil of the two. Eh! what was I saying? And always
give a look into my room every night before you go to
roost. The place swarms with cracksmen, and one can't
be too cautious. Lucky dog, you, to have nothing to be
robbed of !”
Beck winced at that last remark. Grabman did not
seem to notice his confusion, and proceeded, as he put on
his stockings, “And, Beck, you are a good fellow, and have
served me faithfully; when I come back, I will bring you
something handsome—a backey-box—or, who knows, a
beautiful silver watch. Meanwhile, I think—let me see—
yes, I can give you this elegant pair of small-clothes. Put
out my best—the black ones. And now, Beck, I'll not
keep you any longer.”
The poor sweep, with many pulls at his forelock, ac-
knowledged the munificent donation, and having finished
all his preparations, hastened first to his room, to examine
at leisure, and with great admiration, the drab small-
clothes. Room, indeed, we can scarcely style the wretched
inclosure which Beck called his own. It was at the top
of the house, under the roof, and hot—oh, so hot, in the
summer! It had one small begrimed window, through
which the light of heaven never came, for the parapet,
beneath which ran the choked gutter, prevented that.
But the rain and the wind came in. So, sometimes, through
four glassless panes, came a fugitive tom-cat. As for the
rats, they held the place as their own. Accustomed to
Beck, they cared nothing for him. They were the Mayors

of that Palace—he only le roi fainéant. They ran over
his bed at night; he often felt them on his face, and was
convinced they would have eaten him, if there had been
anything worth eating upon his bones; still, perhaps out
of precaution rather than charity, he generally left them a
potato or two, or a crust of bread, to take off the edge of
their appetites. But Beck was far better of than most
who occupied the various settlements in that Alsatia—he
had his room to himself. That was necessary to his sole
luxury—the inspection of his treasury, the safety of his
mattress; for it he paid, without grumbling, what he
thought was a very high rent. To this hole in the roof
there was no lock,--for a very good reason, there was no
door to it. You went up a ladder, as you would go into
a loft. Now, it had often been matter of much intense
cogitation to Beck, whether or not he should have a door
to this chamber; and the result of the cogitation was in-
variably the same—he dared not! What should he want
with a door—a door with a lock to it—for one followed
as a consequence to the other. Such a novel piece of
grandeur would be an ostentatious advertisement that he
had something to guard. He could have no pretense for
it on the ground that he was intruded on by neighbors;
no step but his own was ever caught by him ascending
that ladder, it led to no other room. All the offices re-
quired for the lodgment he performed himself. His sup-
posed poverty was a better safeguard than doors of iron.
Besides this, a door, if dangerous, would be superfluous;
the moment it was suspected that Beck had something

worth guarding, that moment all the picklocks and skele-
ton keys in the neighborhood would be in a jingle. And
a cracksman of high repute lodged already on the ground
floor. So Beck's treasure, like the bird's-nest, was depos-
ited as much out of sight as his instinct could contrive;
and the locks and bolts of civilized man were equally dis-
pensed with by bird and Beck.
On a rusty nail the sweep suspended the drab small-
clothes, stroked them down lovingly, and murmured,
“They be's too good for I—I should like to pop 'em!
But wouldn't that be a shame? Beck, ben't you a hun-
grateful beast to go for to think of nothin' but the tin,
ven your 'art ought to varm with hemotion ? I will wear
'em ven I waits on him. Wen he sees his own smalls bring-
ing in the muffins, he will say, ‘Beck, you becomes em l’”
Fraught with this noble resolution, the sweep caught
up his broom, crept down the ladder, and, with a furtive
glance at the door of the room in which the cracksman
lived, let himself out and shambled his way to his cross-
ing Grabman, in the mean while, dressed himself with
more care than usual, shaved his beard from a four-days'
crop, and, while seated at his breakfast, read attentively
over the notes which Warney had left to him, pausing at
times to make his own pencil memoranda. He then packed
up such few articles as so moderate a worshiper of the
Graces might require, deposited them in an old blue brief.
bag, and this done, he opened his door, and creeping to
the threshold listened carefully. Below, a few sounds
might be heard; here, the wail of a child—there, the

shrill scold of a woman, in that accent above all others
adapted to scold—the Irish. Farther down still, the deep
bass oath of the choleric Resurrection-man; but above,
all was silent. Only one floor intervened between Grab-
man's apartment and the ladder that led to Beck's loft.
And the inmates of that room gave no sound of life.
Grabman took courage, and, shuffling off his shoes, as-
cended the stairs; he passed the closed door of the room
above—he seized the ladder with a shaking hand—he
mounted, step after step—he stood in Beck's room.
Now, O Nicholas Grabman, some moralists may be
harsh enough to condemn thee for what thou art doing :
kneeling yonder, in the dim light, by that curtainless pal-
let, with greedy fingers feeling here and there, and a
placid, self-hugging smile upon thy pale lips. That poor
vagabond, whom thou art about to despoil, has served
thee well and faithfully, has borne with thine ill humors,
thy sarcasms, thy swearings, thy kicks and buffets—often, .
when in the bestial sleep of drunkenness, he has found
thee stretched helpless on thy floor, with a kindly hand he
has moved away the sharp fender, too near that knavish
head, now bent on his ruin; or closed the open window,
lest the keen air, that thy breath tainted, should visit thee
with rheum and fever. Small has been his guerdon for
uncomplaining sacrifice of the few hours spared to the
weary drudge from his daily toil—small, but gratefully
received. And if Beck had been taught to pray, he would
have prayed for thee, as for a good man, O miserable sin-
ner! And thou art going now, Nicholas Grabman, upon an

enterprise which promises thee large gains, and thy purse
is filled; and thou wantest nothing for thy wants, or thy
swinish luxuries. Why should those shaking fingers itch
for the poor beggar-man's hoards?
But hadst thou been bound on an errand that would
have given thee a million, thou wouldst not have left un-
rifled that secret store which thy prying eye had dis-
covered, and thy hungry heart had coveted. No; since
one night, fatal, alas ! to the owner of loft and treasure,
when, needing Beck for some service, and fearing to call
aloud (for the Resurrection-man in the floor below thee,
whose oaths even now ascend to thine ear, sleeps ill, and
has threatened to make thee mute forever if thou disturb-
est him in the few nights in which his dismal calling suffers
him to sleep at all)—thou didst creep up the ladder, and
didst see the unconscious miser at his nightly work, and
after the sight didst steal down again, smiling—no; since
that night, no schoolboy ever more rootedly and ruthlessly
set his mind upon nest of linnet, than thine was set upon
the stores in Beck's mattress.
And yet why, O lawyer, should rigid moralists blame
thee more than such of thy tribe as live honored and re-
spectable, upon the frail and the poor? Who among them
ever left loft or mattress while a rap could be wrung from
either? Matters it to Astraea, whether the spoliation be
made thus nakedly and briefly, or by all the acknowledged
forms in which item on item, six-and-eightpence on six-
and-eightpence, the inexorable hand closes, at length, on
the last farthing of duped despair? Not–Heaven forbid!

—that we make thee, foul Nicholas Grabman, a type for
all the class called attorneys-at-law I Noble hearts, liberal
minds, are there among that brotherhood, we know, and
have experienced; but a type art thou of those whom
want, and error, and need have proved—alas, too well l—
the lawyers of the poor. And even while we write, and
even while ye read, many a Grabman steals from helpless
toil the savings of a life.
Ye poor hoards—darling delights of your otherwise joy-
less owner—how easily has his very fondness made ye the
prey of the spoiler I How gleefully, when the pence swelled
into a shilling, have they been exchanged into the new
bright piece of silver, the newest and brightest that could
be got then the shillings into crowns, then the crowns
into gold—got slyly and at a distance, and contemplated
with what rapture l—so that, at last, the total lay man-
ageable and light in its radiant compass. And what a
total l—what a surprise to Grabman I Had it been but a
sixpence, he would have taken it; but to grasp sovereigns
by the handful, it was too much for him; and, as he rose,
he positively laughed, from a sense of fun.
But amorg his booty there was found one thing that
specially moved his mirth—it was a child's coral, with its
little bells. Who could have given Beck such a bauble—
or how Beck could have refrained from turning it into
money would have been a fit matter for speculation. But
it was not that at which Grabman chuckled ; he laughed,
first, because it was an emblem of the utter childishness
and folly of the creature he was leaving penniless; and,

secondly, because it furnished his ready wit with a capital
contrivance to shift Beck's indignation from his own
shoulders to a party more liable to suspicion. He left
the coral on the floor near the bed, stole down the ladder,
reached his own room, took up his brief-bag, locked his
door, slipped the key in the rat-hole, where the trusty,
plundered Beck alone could find it, and went boldly down
stairs; passing successively the doors, within which still
stormed the Resurrection-man, still wailed the child, still
shrieked the Irish shrew; he paused at the ground floor
occupied by Bill the cracksman, and his long-fingered,
slender, quick-eyed imps, trained already to pass through
broken window panes, on their precocious progress to the
hulks.
The door was open, and gave a pleasant sight of the
worthy family within. Bill himself, a stout-looking fellow,
with a florid, jolly countenance, and a pipe in his mouth,
was sitting at his window, with his brawny legs lolling on
a table covered with the remains of a very tolerable break-
fast. Four small Bills were employed in certain sports,
which no doubt, according to the fashionable mode of
education, instilled useful lessons under the artful guise of
playful amusement. Against the wall, at one corner of the
room, was affixed a row of bells, from which were suspended
exceedingly tempting apples by slender wires. Two of the
boys were engaged in the innocent entertainment of ex-
tricating the apples without occasioning any alarm from
the bells; a third was amusing himself at a table, covered
with mock rings and trinkets, in a way that seemed really

surprising; with the end of a finger dipped probably in
some glutinous matter, he just touched one of the gew-
gaws, and lo, it vanished l—vanished so magically, that
the quickest eye could scarcely trace whither; sometimes
up a cuff, sometimes into a shoe—here, there, anywhere—
except back again upon the table. The fourth, an urchin
apparently about five years old,—he might be much younger,
judging from his stunted size; somewhat older, judging
from the vicious acuteness of his face,—on the floor under
his father's chair, was diving his little hand into the paternal
pockets in search for a marble, sportively hidden in those
capacious recesses. On the rising geniuses around him,
Bill the cracksman looked, and his father's heart was
proud.
Pausing at the threshold, Grabman looked in, and said,
cheerfully, “Good day to you—good day to you all, my
little dears.”
“Ah, Grabman,” said Bill, rising, and making a bow,
for Bill valued himself much on his politeness—“come to
blow a cloud, eh? Bob l’’ (this to the eldest born), “man-
ners, sir; wipe your nose, and set a chair for the gent.”
“Many thanks to you, Bill, but I can't stay now—I have
a long journey to take. But bless my soul, how stupid I
am; I have forgotten my clothes-brush. I knew there
was something on my mind all the way I was coming down
stairs. I was saying to myself, ‘Grabman, there is some-
thing forgotten ""
“I know what that 'ere feelin' is,” said Bill, thought,
fully; “I had it myself the night afore last; and sure

enough when I got to the but that's neither here nor
there. Bob, run up stairs, and fetch down Mr. Grabman's
clothes-brush. 'Tis the least you can do for a gent who
saved your father from the fate of them 'ere innocent apples,
—your fist, Grabman. I have a heart in my buzzom;—
cut me open, and you will find there ‘Halibi and Grab-
man!'. Give Bob your key.”
“The brush is not in my room,” answered Grabman;
“it is at the top of the house; up the ladder, in Beck's
loft—Beck, the sweeper. The stupid dog always keeps it
there, and forgot to give it me. Sorry to occasion my
friend Bob so much trouble.” -
“Bob has a soul above trouble; his father's heart beats
in his buzzom. Bob, track the dancers. Up like a lark
—and down like a dump.”
Bob grinned, made a mow at Mr. Grabman, and scamp-
ered up the stairs.
“You never attends our free-and-easy,” said Bill; “but
we toasts you, with three times three, and up standing.
"Tis a hungrateful world ! But some men has a heart;
and, to those who has a heart, Grabman is a trump!”
“I am sure, whenever I can do you a service, you may
reckon on me. Meanwhile, if you could get that cursed
bullying fellow who lives under me to be a little more
civil, you would oblige me.”
“Under you? No. 7 | No. 7—is it? Grabman, ham
I a man? Is this a harm, and this a buºnch of fives? I
dare's do all that does become a man; but No. 7 is a

No. 7 might whop me—and this harm would let him
whop ! He lives with graves, and church-yards, and stiff
'uns—that damnable No. 7 | Ask some'at else, Grabman.
I dares not touch No. 7 any more than the ghosteses.”
Grabman sneered as he saw that Bill, stout rogue as he
was, turned pale while he spoke; but at that moment Bob
reappeared with the clothes-brush, which the ex-attorney
thrust into his pocket; and shaking Bill by the hand, and
patting Bob on the head, he set out on his journey.
Bill reseated himself, muttering, “Bully a body-snatcher!
'drot that Grabman, does he want to get rid of poor Bill?”
Meanwhile Bob exhibited slyly, to his second brother,
the sight of Beck's stolen coral. The children took care
not to show it to their father. They were already inspired
by the laudable ambition to set up in business on their
own account.

PERCIVAL VISITS LUCRETIA.
HAVING once ascertained the house in which Helen
lived, it was no difficult matter for St. John to learn the
name of the guardian whom Beck had supposed to be her
mother. No common delight mingled with Percival's
amaze, when in that name he recognized one borne by his
own kinswoman. Very little, indeed, of the family history
was known to him. Neither his father nor his mother
ever willingly conversed of the fallen heiress—it was a
subject which the children had felt to be proscribed; but
in the neighborhood, Percival had of course heard some
mention of Lucretia, as the haughty and accomplished
Miss Clavering—who had, to the astonishment of all,
stooped to a mésalliance with her uncle's French librarian.
That her loss of the St. John property, the succession of
Percival's father, were unexpected by the villagers and
squires around, and perhaps set down to the caprice of
Sir Miles, or to an intellect impaired by apoplectic attacks,
it was not likely that he should have heard. The rich
have the polish of their education, and the poor that in-
stinctive tact so wonderful among the agricultural peas-
antry, to prevent such unmannerly disclosures or unwel-

come hints; and, both by rich and poor, the Vernon St.
Johns were too popular and respected for wanton allusions
to subjects calculated to pain them. All, therefore, that
Percival knew of his relation was, that she had resided
from infancy with Sir Miles; that after their uncle's death
she had married an inferior in rank, of the name of Dali-
bard, and settled abroad; that she was a person of peculiar
manners; and, he had heard somewhere, of rare gifts.
He had been unable to learn the name of the young lady
staying with Madame Dalibard; he had learned only that
she went by some other name, and was not the daughter
of the lady who rented the house. Certainly, it was pos-
sible that this last might not be his kinswoman, after all.
The name, though strange to English ears, and not com-
mon in France, was no sufficient warrant for Percival's
high spirits at the thought that he had now won legiti-
mate and regular access to the house—still it allowed him
to call; it furnished a fair excuse for a visit.
How long he was at his toilet that day, poor boy! How
sedulously, with comb and brush, he sought to smooth
into straight precision that luxuriant labyrinth of jetty
curls, which had never cost him a thought before I Gil
Blas says that the toilet is a pleasure to the young though
a labor to the old; Percival St. John's toilet was no
pleasure to him that anxious morning.
At last, he tore himself, dissatisfied and desperate, from
the glass, caught his hat and his whip, threw himself on his
horse, and rode, at first very fast and at last very slowly,
to the old, decayed, shabby, neglected house, that lay hid,

like the poverty of fallen pride, amid the trim villas and
smart cottages of fair and flourishing Brompton.
The same servant who had opened the gate to Ard-
worth appeared to his summons, and, after eyeing him for
some moments with a listless stupid stare, said, “You’ll
be after some mistake l’” and turned away.
“Stop–stop !” cried Percival, trying to intrude himself
through the gate; but the servant blocked up the entrance
sturdily. “It is no mistake at all, my good lady. I have
come to see Madame Dalibard, my—my relation 1"
“Your relation " and again the woman stared at Per-
cival with a look through the dull vacancy of which some
distrust was dimly perceptible. “Bide a bit there, and

Percival gave his card to the servant, with his sweetest
and most persuasive smile. She took it with one hand,
and, with the other, turned the key in the gate, leaving
Percival outside. It was five minutes before she returned,
and she then, with the same prim, smileless expression
of countenance, opened the gate and motioned him to
follow.
The kind-hearted boy sighed as he cast a glance at the
desolate and poverty-stricken appearance of the house, and
thought within himself—“Ah, pray Heaven, she may be
my relation, and then I shall have the right to find her,
and that sweet girl, a very different home !” The old
woman threw open the drawing-room door, and Percival
was in the presence of his deadliest foe! The arm-chair
was turned toward the entrance, and from amid the cover.

ings that hid the form, the remarkable countenance of
Madame Dalibard emerged, sharp and earnest, directly
fronting the intruder.
“So,” she said slowly, and, as it were devouring him
with her keen, steadfast eyes—“so, you are Percival St.
John I Welcome! I did not know that we should ever
meet. I have not sought you—you seek mel Strange—
yes, strange—that the young and the rich should seek the
suffering and the poor!”
Surprised and embarrassed by this singular greeting,
Percival halted abruptly in the middle of the room; and
there was something inexpressibly winning in his shy, yet
graceful confusion. It seemed, with silent eloquence, to
apologize and to deprecate. And when, in his silvery
voice, scarcely yet tuned to the fullness of manhood, he
said, feelingly, “Forgive me, madam, but my mother is
not in England,”—the excuse evinced such delicacy of
idea, so exquisite a sense of high breeding, that the calm
assurance of worldly ease could not have more attested the
chivalry of the native gentleman..
“I have nothing to forgive, Mr. St. John,” said Lucretia,
with a softened manner. “Pardon me rather, that my
infirmities do not allow me to rise to receive you. This
seat—here—next to me. You have a strong likeness to
your father.”
Percival received this last remark as a compliment, and
bowed. Then, as he lifted his ingenuous brow, he took,
for the first time, a steady view of his new found relation.
The peculiarities of Lucretia's countenance in youth had

naturally deepened with middle age. The contour, always
too sharp and pronounced, was now strong and bony as a
man's : the line between the eyebrows was hollowed into
a furrow. The eye retained its old uneasy, sinister, side-
long glance; or, at rare moments (as when Percival en-
tered), its searching penetration, and assured command;
but the eyelids themselves, red and injected, as with grief
or vigil, gave something haggard and wild, whether to
glance or gaze. Despite the paralysis of the frame, the
face, though pale and thin, showed no bodily decay. A
vigor surpassing the strength of woman might still be
seen in the play of the bold muscles, the firmness of the
contracted lips. What physicians call “vitality,” and trace
at once (if experienced) on the physiognomy, as the prog-
nostic of long life, undulated restlessly in every aspect of
the face, every movement of those thin nervous hands,
which, contrasting the rest of that motionless form, never
seemed to be at rest. The teeth were still white and
regular, as in youth; and when they shone out in speak-
ing, gave a strange, unnatural freshness to a face otherwise
so worn.
As Percival gazed, and, while gazing, saw those wan-
dering eyes bent down, and yet felt they watched him, a
thrill, almost of fear, shot through his heart. Neverthe
less, so much more impressionable was he to charitable
and trustful, than to suspicious and timid emotions, that,
when Madame Dalibard, suddenly looking up, and shak-
ing her head gently, said: “You see but a sad wreck,
young kinsman,” all those instincts, which nature itself

seemed to dictate for self-preservation, vanished into heav-
enly tenderness and pity.
“Ah!” he said, rising and pressing one of those deadly
hands in both his own, while tears rose to his eyes,—“ah!
since you call me kinsman, I have all a kinsman's priv-
ileges. You must have the best advice—the most skillful
surgeons. Oh, you will recover—you must not despond.”
Lucretia's lips moved uneasily. This kindness took her
by surprise. She turned desperately away from the human
gleam that shot across the sevenfold gloom of her soul:
“Do not think of me,” she said, with a forced smile : “it is
my peculiarity not to like allusion to myself, though this
time I provoked it. Speak to me of the old cedar-trees
at Laughton—do they stand still 7 You are the master of
Laughton now:—it is a noble heritage 1”
Then St. John, thinking to please her, talked of the old
manor-house, described the improvements made by his
father, spoke gayly of those which he himself contem-
plated; and as he ran on, Lucretia's brow, a moment ruf-
fled, grew smooth and smoother, and the gloom settled
back upon her soul.
All at once she interrupted him. “How did you dis-
cover me—was it through Mr. Warney 7 I bade him not
mention me—yet how else could you learn?” As she
spoke, there was an anxious trouble in her tone, which
increased while she observed that St. John looked con-
fused. -
“Why,” he began, hesitatingly, and brushing his hat
with his hand; “why—perhaps you may have heard from

. Ah, it is you
the-that is—I think there is a young
—it is you ! I see you once again!” And springing up,
he was at the side of Helen, who at that instant had en-
tered the room, and now, her eyes downcast, her cheeks
blushing, her breast gently heaving,-heard, but answered
not that passionate burst of joy.
Startled, Madame Dalibard (her hands firmly grasping
the sides of her chair) contemplated the two. She had
heard nothing, guessed nothing of their former meeting.
All that had passed before between them was unknown to
her. Yet there was evidence unmistakable, conclusive—
the son of her despoiler loved the daughter of her rival,
and—if the virgin heart speaks by the outward sign—
those downcast eyes, those blushing cheeks, that heaving
breast, told that he did not love in vainl
Before her lurid and murderous gaze, as if to defy her,
the two inheritors of a revenge unglutted by the grave—
stood, united mysteriously together. Up from the vast
ocean of her hate rose that poor isle of love; there, un-
conscious of the horror around them, the victims found
their footing! How beautiful at that hour their youth—
their very ignorance of their own emotions—their innocent
gladness—their sweet trouble ! The fell gazer drew a long
breath of fiend-like complacency and glee, and her hands
opened wide, and then slowly closed, as if she felt them in
her grasp.

AND from that day Percival had his privileged entry
into Madame Dalibard's house. The little narrative of
the circumstances connected with his first meeting with
Helen, partly drawn from Percival, partly afterward from
Helen (with blushing and faltered excuses from the latter
for not having mentioned before an incident that might,
perhaps needlessly, vex or alarm her aunt in so delicate a
state of health), was received by Lucretia with rare gra-
ciousness. The connection not only between herself and
Percival, but between Percival and Helen, was allowed,
and even dwelt upon by Madame Dalibard, as a natural
reason for permitting the artless intimacy which imme-
diately sprang up between these young persons. She per-
mitted Percival to call daily, to remain for hours, to share
in their simple meals, to wander alone with Helen in the
garden, assist her to bind up the ragged flowers, and sit
by her in the old ivy-grown arbor, when their work was
done. She affected to look upon them both as children,
and to leave to them that happy familiarity which child-
hood only sanctions, and compared to which the affection
of maturer years seems at once coarse and cold.

As they grew more familiar, the differences and simi-
larities in their characters came out, and nothing more
delightful than the harmony into which even the contrasts
blended ever invited the guardian angel to pause and
smile. As flowers in some trained parterre relieve each
other, now softening, now heightening each several hue,
till all unite in one concord of interwoven beauty, so these
two blooming natures, brought together, seemed, where
varying still, to melt and fuse their affluences into one
wealth of innocence and sweetness. Both had a native
buoyancy and cheerfulness of spirit, a noble trustfulness in
others, a singular candor, and freshness of mind and feel-
ing. But beneath the gayety of Helen there was a soft
and holy understream of thoughtful melancholy, a high
and religious sentiment that vibrated more exquisitely to
the subtle mysteries of creation—the solemn unison be-
tween the bright world without and the grave destinies of
that world within (which is an imperishable soul), than the
lighter and more vivid youthfulness of Percival had yet
conceived. In him, lay the germs of the active mortal,
who might win distinction in the bold career we run upon
the surface of the earth. In her, there was that finer and
more spiritual essence, which lifts the poet to the golden
atmosphere of dreams, and reveals in glimpses to the saint
the choral Populace of Heaven. We do not say that
Helen would ever have found the utterance of the poet,
that her reveries, undefined and unanalyzed, could have
taken the sharp, clear form of words. For to the poet,
practically developed and made manifest to the world.

many other gifts, besides the mere poetic sense, are needed;
stern study, and logical generalization of scattered truths,
and patient observation of the characters of men, and the
wisdom that comes from sorrow and passion, and a sage's
experience of things actual, embracing the dark secrets of
human infirmity and crime. But, despite all that has been
said in disparagement or disbelief of “mute inglorious
Miltons,” we maintain that there are natures in which the
divinest element of poetry exists, the purer and more deli-
cate for escaping from bodily form, and evaporating from
the coarser vessels into which the poet, so called, must
pour the ethereal fluid. There is a certain virtue within
us, comprehending our subtlest and noblest emotions, which
is poetry while untold, and grows pale and poor in propor-
tion as we strain it into poems. Nay, it may be said of
this airy property of our inmost being, that, more or less,
it departs from us, according as we give it forth into the
world, even, as only by the loss of its particles, the rose
wastes its perfume on the air. So this more spiritual sen-
sibility dwelt in Helen, as the latent mesmerism in water,
as the invisible fairy in an enchanted ring. It was an
essence or divinity, shrined and shrouded in herself, which
gave her more intimate and vital union with all the influ-
ences of the universe, a companion to her loneliness, an
angel hymning low to her own listening soul. This made
her enjoyment of Nature, in its merest trifles, exquisite and
profound; this gave to her tenderness of heart all the
delicious and sportive variety love borrows from imagina-
tion; this lifted her piety above the mere forms of conven-

tional religion, and breathed into her prayers the ecstasy of
the saint.
But Helen was not the less filled with the sweet human-
ities of her age and sex; her very gravity was tinged with
rosy light, as a western cloud with the sun. She had
sportiveness, and caprice, and even whim, as the butterfly,
though the emblem of the soul, still flutters wantonly over
every wild flower, and expands its glowing wings on the
sides of the beaten road. And with a sense of weakness
in the common world (growing out of her very strength in
nobler atmospheres), she leaned the more trustfully on the
strong arm of her young adorer; not fancying that the
difference between them arose from superiority in her,
but rather as a bird once tamed flies at the sight of the
hawk to the breast of its owner; so from each airy flight
into the loftier heaven, let but the thought of danger daunt
her wing, and, as in a more powerful nature, she took refuge
on that fostering heart.
The love between these children, for so, if not literally
in years, in their newness to all that steals the freshness
and the dew from maturer life, they may be rightly called,
was such as befitted those whose souls have not forfeited
the Eden. It was more like the love of fairies than
of human beings. They showed it to each other, inno-
cently and frankly; yet of love, as we of the grosser crea-
tion call it, with its impatient pains, and burning hopes,
they never spoke nor dreamed. It was an unutterable,
ecstatic fondness—a clinging to each other—in thought,
desire, and heart—a joy more than mortal in each other's

presence; yet, in parting, not that idle and empty sorrow
which unfits the weak for the homelier demands on time
and life. And this, because of the wondrous trust in them-
selves, and in the future, which made a main part of their
credulous happy natures. Neither felt fear nor jealousy—
or if jealousy came, it was the pretty child-like jealousies,
which have no sting—of the bird, if Helen listened to its
note too long—of the flower, if Percival left Helen's side
too quickly, to tie up its drooping petals, or refresh its
dusty leaves. Close by the stir of the great city, with all
its fret, and chafe, and storm of life—in the desolate gar-
den of that somber house, and under the withering eyes of
relentless Crime, revived the Arcady of old—the scene
vocal to the reeds of idyllist and shepherd: and in the
midst of the iron Tragedy, harmlessly and unconsciously
arose the strain of the Pastoral Music.

fearless happiness she had promoted. The image of a
felicity at once so great and so holy, wore to her gloomy
sight the aspect of a mocking Fury. It rose in contrast
to her own ghastly and crime-stained life; it did not up-
braid her conscience with guilt so loudly as it scoffed at
her intellect for folly. These children, playing on the
verge of life, how much more of life's true secret did they
already know, than she, with all her vast native powers,

and toiled, and sinned? As a conqueror stricken unto
death would render up all the regions vanquished by his
sword for one drop of water to his burning lips, how gladly
would she have given all the knowledge bought with blood
and fire, to feel one moment as those children felt l Then,
from out her silent and grim despair, stood forth, fierce
and prominent, the great fiend, Revenge.
By a monomania not uncommon to those who have
made self the center of being, Lucretia referred to her own
sullen history of wrong and passion, all that bore analogy
to it, however distant. She had never been enabled, with-
out an intolerable pang of hate and envy, to contemplate
courtship and love in others. From the rudest shape to
the most refined—that master-passion in the existence, at
least, of woman—reminding her of her own brief episode
of human tenderness and devotion, opened every wound,
and wrung every fiber of a heart that, while crime had in-
durated it to most emotions, memory still left morbidly
sensitive to one. But if tortured by the sight of love in
those who had had no connection with her fate—who stood
apart from her lurid orbit, and were gazed upon only afar
(as a lost soul, from the abyss, sees the gleam of angels'
wings within some planet it never has explored), how in-
effably more fierce and intolerable was the wrath that
seized her, when, in her haunted imagination, she saw all
Susan's rapture at the vows of Mainwaring mantling in
Helen's face | All that might have disarmed a heart as
hard, but less diseased, less preoccupied by revenge, only
irritated more the consuming hate of that inexorable spirit.

Helen's seraphic purity—her exquisite overflowing kind-
ness, ever forgetting self—her airy cheerfulness—even her
very moods of melancholy, calm and seemingly causeless
as they were, perpetually galled and blistered that writhing
preternatural susceptibility which is formed by the con-
sciousness of infamy, the dreary egotism of one cut off
from the charities of the world, with whom all mirth is
sardonic convulsion, all sadness, rayless, and unresigned
despair.
Of the two, Percival inspired her with feelings the most
akin to humanity. For him, despite her bitter memories
of his father, she felt something of compassion, and shrunk
from the touch of his frank hand, in remorse. She had
often need to whisper to herself, that his life was an obsta-
cle to the heritage of the son; of whom, as we have seen,
she was in search, and whom, indeed, she believed she had
already found in John Ardworth; that it was not in wrath
and in vengeance that this victim was to be swept into the
grave, but as an indispensable sacrifice to a cherished ob-
ject—a determined policy. As in the studies of her youth,
she had adopted the Machiavelism of ancient state-craft as
a rule admissible in private life, so she seemed scarcely to
admit as a crime that which was but the removal of a
barrier between her aim and her end. Before she had
become personally acquainted with Percival, she had re-
jected all occasion to know him. She had suffered Warney
to call upon him, as the old protegé of Sir Miles, and to
wind into his intimacy—meaning to leave to her accom-
plice, when the hour should arrive, the dread task of de-

struction. This, not from cowardice, for Gabriel had once
rightly described her when he said, that “if she lived with
shadows, she could quell them,” but simply because, more
intellectually unsparing than constitutionally cruel (save
where the old vindictive memories thoroughly unsexed
her), this was a victim whose pangs she desired not to
witness, over whose fate it was no luxury to gloat and
revel. She wished not to see, nor to know him living,
only to learn that he was no more, and that Helen alone
stood between Laughton and her son. Now that he had
himself, as if with predestined feet, crossed her threshold
—that he, like Helen, had delivered himself into her toils,
the hideous guilt, before removed from her hands, became
haunting, fronted her face to face, and filled her with a
superstitious awe.
Meanwhile, her outward manner to both her meditated
victims, if moody and fitful at times, was not such as would
have provoked suspicion even in less credulous hearts.
From the first entry of Helen under her roof, she had been
formal and measured in her welcome—kept her, as it were,
aloof, and affected no prodigal superfluity of dissimula-
tion; but she had never been positively harsh or unkind
in word or in deed, and had coldly excused herself for the
repulsiveness of her manner.
“I am irritable,” she said, “from long suffering; I am
unsocial from habitual solitude; do not expect from me
the fondness and warmth that should belong to our re-
ſationship. Do not harass yourself with vain solicitude
for one whom all seeming attention but reminds more

painfully of infirmity, and who, even thus stricken down,
would be independent of all cares not bought and paid for.
Be satisfied to live here in all reasonable liberty, to follow
your own habits and caprices uncontrolled. Regard me
but as a piece of necessary furniture. You can never dis-
please me, but when you notice that I live and suffer.”
If Helen wept bitterly at these hard words when first
spoken, it was not with anger that her loving heart was so
thrown back upon herself. On the contrary, she became
inspired with a compassion so great that it took the char-
acter of reverence. She regarded this very coldness as a
mournful dignity. She felt grateful that one who could
thus dispense with, should yet have sought her. She had
heard her mother say that “she had been under great ob-
ligations to Lucretia;” and now, when she was forbidden
to repay them, even by a kiss on those weary eyelids, a
daughter's hand to that sleepless pillow; when she saw
that the barrier first imposed was irremovable—that no
time diminished the distance her aunt set between them—
that the least approach to the tenderness of service be-
yond the most casual offices, really seemed but to fret
those excitable nerves, and fever the hand that she ven-
tured timorously to clasp; she retreated into herself with a
sad amaze that increased her pity and heightened her re-
spect. To her, love seemed so necessary a thing in the
helplessness of human life, even when blessed with health
and youth, that this rejection of all love in one so bowed
and crippled, struck her imagination as something sublime
in its dreary grandeur and stoic pride of independence.

She regarded it, as of old a tender and pious nun would
have regarded the asceticism of some sanctified recluse—as
Teresa (had she lived in the same age) might have re-
garded St. Simon Stylites existing aloft from human sym-
pathy on the roofless summit of his column of stone: and
with this feeling she sought to inspire Percival. He had
the heart to enter into her compassion, but not the im-
agination to sympathize with her reverence. Even the
repugnant awe that he had first conceived for Madame
Dalibard, so bold was he by temperament, he had long
since cast off; he recognized only the moroseness and
petulance of an habitual invalid, and shook playfully his
glossy curls, when Helen, with her sweet seriousness, in-
sisted on his recognizing more.
To this house few, indeed, were the visitors admitted.
The Miverses, whom the benevolent officiousness of Mr.
Fielden had originally sent thither to see their young kins-
woman, now and then came to press Helen to join some
party to the theater, or Vauxhall, or a pic-nic in Rich-
mond Park; but when they found their overtures, which
had at first been politely accepted by Madame Dalibard,
were rejected, they gradually ceased their visits, wounded
and indignant.
Certain it was, that Lucretia had, at one time, eagerly
caught at their well-meant civilities to Helen—now she
as abruptly declined them. Why? It would be hard to
plumb into all the black secrets of that heart. It would
have been but natural to her, who shrank from dooming
Helen to no worse calamity than a virgin's grave, to have

designed to throw her in such uncongenial guidance, amid
all the manifold temptations of the corrupt city—to have
suffered her to be seen, and to be ensnared by those gal-
lants ever on the watch for defenseless beauty; and to
contrast with their elegance of mien, and fatal flatteries—
the grossness of the companions selected for her, and the
unloving discomfort of the home into which she had been
thrown. But now that St. John had appeared — that
Helen's heart and fancy were steeled alike against more
dangerous temptation,-the object to be obtained from the
pressing courtesy of Mrs. Mivers existed no more. The
vengeance flowed into other channels.
The only other visitors at the house were John Ard-
worth and Gabriel Warney.
Madame Dalibard watched vigilantly the countenance
and manner of Ardworth, when, after presenting him to
Percival, she whispered—“I am glad you assured me as
to your sentiments for Helen. She has found there the
lover you wished for her—‘gay and handsome as herself.”
And, in the sudden paleness that overspread Ardworth's
face, in his compressed lips, and convulsive start, she read
with unspeakable rage the untold secret of his heart—till
the rage gave way to complacency at the thought that the
last insult to her wrongs was spared her—that her son (as
son she believed he was) could not now, at least, be the
successful suitor of her loathed sister's loathed child. Her
discovery, perhaps, confirmed her in her countenance to
Percival's progressive wooing, and half reconciled her to
the pangs it inflicted on herself.


## p. 96 (#454) #############################################

96 LU CRETIA.
At the first introduction, Ardworth had scarcely glanced
at Percival. He regarded him but as the sleek flutterer
in the sunshine of fortune. And for the idle, the gay, the
fair, the well dressed, and wealthy—the sturdy workman of
his own rough way felt something of the uncharitable dis-
dain which the laborious have nots too usually entertain
for the prosperous haves. But the moment the unwelcome
intelligence of Madame Dalibard was conveyed to him, the
smooth-faced boy swelled into dignity and importance.
Yet it was not merely as a rival, that that strong manly
heart, after the first natural agony, regarded Percival.
No, he looked upon him less with anger than with interest
—as the one in whom Helen's happiness was henceforth to
be invested. And to Madame Dalibard's astonishment, for
this nature was wholly new to her experience, she saw him,
even in that first interview, composing his rough face to
smiles, smoothing his bluff imperious accents into courtesy,
listening patiently, watching benignly, and at last thrusting
his large hand frankly forth—griping Percival's slender
fingers in his own; and then, with an indistinct chuckle,
that seemed half laugh and half groan, as if he did not
dare to trust himself further, he made his wonted uncere-
monious nod, and strode hurriedly from the room.
But he came again and again, almost daily, for about
a fortnight; sometimes, without entering the house, he
would join the young people in the garden, assist them
with awkward hands in their playful work on the garden,
or sit with them in the ivied bower; and, warming more
and more each time he came, talk at last with the cordial

frankness of an elder brother. There was no disguise in
this—he began to love Percival—what would seem more
strange to the superficial, to admire him. Genius has a
quick perception of the moral qualities; genics which,
differing thus from mere talent, is more allied to the heart
than to the head, sympathizes genially with goodness.
Ardworth respected that young, ingenuous, unpolluted
mind: he himself felt better and purer in its atmosphere.
Much of the affection he cherished for Helen passed thus
beautifully and nobly into his sentiments for the one whom
Helen not unworthily preferred. And they grew so fond
of him 1 as the young and gentle ever will grow fond of
genius—however rough—once admitted to its companion-
ship !
Percival, by this time, had recalled to his mind where
he had first seen that strong-featured, dark-browed counte-
nance, and he gayly reminded Ardworth of his discourtesy
on the brow of the hill which commanded the view of Lon-
don. That reminiscence made his new friend writhe ; for
then, amid all his ambitious visions of the future, he had
seen Helen in the distance—the reward of every labor—
the fairest star in his horizon. But he strove stoutly
against the regret of the illusion lost: the vivendi causae
were left him still, and for the nymph that had glided from
his clasp, he clung at least to the laurel that was left in
her place. In the folds of his robust fortitude Ardworth
thus wrapped his secret. Neither of his young playmates
suspected it. He would have disdained himself if he had
so poisoned their pleasure. That he suffered when alone,

much and bitterly, is not to be denied; but in that mascu-
line and complete being, Love took but its legitimate rank,
amid the passions and cares of man. It soured no exist-
ence—it broke no heart—the wind swept some blossoms
from the bough, and tossed wildly the agitated branches
from root to summit, but the trunk stood firm.
In some of these visits to Madame Dalibard's, Ardworth
renewed with her the more private conversation which had
so unsettled his past convictions as to his birth, and so dis-
turbed the calm, strong currents of his mind. He was
chiefly anxious to learn what conjectures Madame Dali-
bard had formed as to his parentage, and what ground
there was for belief that he was near in blood to herself,
or that he was born to a station less dependent on conti-
nuous exertion; but on these points the dark sibyl pre-
served an obstinate silence. She was satisfied with the
hints she had already thrown out, and absolutely refused
to say more till better authorized by the inquiries she had
set on foot. Artfully, she turned from these topics of
closer and more household interest, to those on which she
had previously insisted—connected with the general knowl-
edge of mankind, and the complicated science of practical
life. To fire his genius, wing his energies, inflame his am-
bition above that slow, laborious drudgery to which he
had linked the chances of his career, and which her fiery
and rapid intellect was wholly unable to comprehend—
save as a waste of life for uncertain and distant objects—
became her task. And she saw with delight that Ard-
worth listened to her more assentingly than he had done

at first. In truth, the pain shut within his heart, the con-
flict waged keenly between his reason and his passion,
unfitted him, for the time, for mere mechanical employment,
in which his genius could afford him no consolation. Now,
genius is given to man, not only to enlighten others, but to
comfort as well as to elevate himself. Thus, in all the sorrows
of actual existence, the man is doubly inclined to turn to
his genius for distraction. Harassed in this world of action,
he knocks at the gate of that world of idea or fancy which
he is privileged to enter: he escapes from the clay to the
spirit. And rarely, till some great grief comes, does the
man in whom the celestial fire is lodged know all the gift
of which he is possessed. At last, Ardworth's visits ceased
abruptly. He shut himself up once more in his chambers;
but the law books were laid aside.
Warney, who generally contrived to call when Ardworth
was not there, seldom interrupted the lovers in their little
paradise of the garden; but he took occasion to ripen and
cement his intimacy with Percival: sometimes walked, or
(if St. John had his cabriolet) drove home and dined with
him, téte-à-tête, in Curzon Street; and as he made Helen
his chief subject of conversation, Percival could not but
esteem him among the most agreeable of men. With
Helen, when Percival was not there, Warney held some
secret conferences—secret even from Percival; two or
three times, before the hour in which Percival was accus-
tomed to come, they had been out together: and Helen's
face looked more cheerful than usual on their return. It
was not surprising that Gabriel Warney, so displeasing to

a man like Ardworth, should have won little less favor
with Helen than with Percival; for, to say nothing of an
ease and suavity of manner which stole into the confidence
of those in whom to confide was a natural propensity, his
various acquisitions and talents, imposing, from the surface
over which they spread, and the glitter which they made,
had an inevitable effect upon a mind so susceptible as
Helen's to admiration for art and respect for knowledge.
But what chiefly conciliated her to Warney, whom she
regarded, moreover, as her aunt's most intimate friend,
was that she was persuaded he was unhappy, and wronged
by the world or fortune. Warney had a habit of so repre-
senting himself— of dwelling with a bitter eloquence—
which his natural malignity made forcible—on the injus-
tice of the world to superior intellect. He was a great
accuser of Fate. It is the illogical weakness of some evil
natures to lay all their crimes, and the consequences of
crime, upon Destiny. There was a heat, a vigor, a rush
of words, and a readiness of strong, if trite, imagery in
what Warney said, that deceived the young into the mon-
strous error that he was an enthusiast—misanthropical,
perhaps, but only so from enthusiasm. How could Helen,
whose slightest thought, when a star broke forth from the
cloud, or a bird sung suddenly from the copse, had more
of wisdom and of poetry than all Warney's gaudy and
painted seemings ever could even mimic—how could she
be so, deceived 7 Yet so it was. Here stood a man whose
youth she supposed had been devoted to refined and ele-
vating pursuits, gifted, neglected, disappointed, solitary,

and unhappy. She saw little beyond. You had but to
touch her pity to win her interest and to excite her trust.
Of anything further, even had Percival never existed, she
could not have dreamed. It was because a secret and un-
definable repugnance, in the midst of pity, trust, and friend-
ship, put Warney altogether out of the light of a possible
lover, that all those sentiments were so easily kindled.
This repugnance arose not from the disparity between
their years; it was rather that nameless uncongeniality,
which does not forbid friendship but is irreconcilable with
love. To do Warney justice, he never offered to reconcile
the two. Not for love did he secretly confer with Helen
—not for love did his heart beat against the hand which
reposed so carelessly on his murderous arm.

THE RATTLE OF THE SNAKE.
THE progress of affection between natures like those of
Percival and Helen, favored by free and constant inter-
course, was naturally rapid. It was scarcely five weeks
from the day he had first seen Helen, and he already re-
garded her as his plighted bride. During the earlier days
of his courtship, Percival, enamored and absorbed for the
first time in his life, did not hasten to make his mother the
confidante of his happiness. He had written but twice;
and though he said briefly, in the second letter, that he
had discovered two relations, both interesting, and one
chalming, he had deferred naming them, or entering into
detail. This, not alone from that indescribable coyness
which all have experienced il, addressing even those with
whom they are most intimate, in the early, half unrevealed,
and mystic emotions of first love; but because Lady Mary's
letters had been so full of her sister's declining health, of
her own anxieties and fears, that he had shrunk from
giving her a new subject of anxiety; and a confidence,
full of hope and joy, seemed to him unfeeling and un-
seasonable. He knew how necessarily uneasy and restless
an avowal that his heart was seriously engaged to one she
had never seen, would make that tender mother; and that

his confession would rather add to her cares, than produce
sympathy with his transports. But now, feeling impatient
for his mother's assent to the formal proposals which had
become due to Madame Dalibard and Helen, and taking
advantage of the letter last received from her, which gave
more cheering accounts of her sister, and expressed curi-
osity for further explanation as to his half disclosure, he
wrote at length, and cleared his breast of all its secrets.
It was the same day in which he wrote this confession,
and pleaded his cause, that we accompany him to the
house of his sweet mistress, and leave him by her side in
the accustomed garden. Within, Madame Dalibard, whose
chair was set by the window, bent over certain letters,
which she took, one by one, from her desk, and read slowly,
lifting her eyes from time to time, and glancing toward the
young people, as they walked, hand in hand, round the
small demesnes, now hid by the fading foliage, now emerg-
ing into view. Those letters were the early love epistles
of William Mainwaring. She had not recurred to them
for years. Perhaps she now felt that food necessary to the
sustainment of her fiendish designs. It was a strange
spectacle, to see this being, so full of vital energy, mobile
and restless as a serpent; condemned to that helpless
decrepitude, chained to the uneasy seat—not as in the
resigned and passive imbecility of extreme age, but rather
as one whom, in the prime of life, the rack has broken,
leaving the limbs inert, the mind active, the form as one
dead, the heart with superabundant vigor; – a cripple's
impotence, and a Titan's will ! What, in that dreary im-

prisonment, and amid the silence she habitually preserved,
passed through the caverns of that breast, one can no
more conjecture than one can count the blasts that sweep
and rage through the hollows of impenetrable rock, or the
elements that conflict in the bosom of the volcano, ever-
lastingly at work. She had read, and replaced the letters,
and leaning her cheek on her hand, was gazing vacantly
on the wall, when Warney intruded on that dismal solitude.
He closed the door after him with more than usual care;
and, drawing a seat close to Lucretia's, said, “Belle mere,
the time has arrived for you to act—my part is well-nigh
closed.”
“Ay!” said Lucretia, wearily, “what is the news you
bring 7”
“First,” replied Warney, and, as he spoke, he shut the
window, as if his whisper could possibly be heard without
—“first, all this business connected with Helen is at length
arranged. You know when, agreeably to your permission,
I first suggested to her, as it were casually, that you were
so reduced in fortune that I trembled to regard your fu-
ture, that you had years ago sacrificed nearly half your
pecuniary resources to maintain her parents—she of her-
self reminded me that she was entitled, when of age, to a
sum far exceeding all her wants, and—”
“That I might be a pensioner on the child of William
Mainwaring and Susan Mivers,” interrupted Lucretia.
“I know that, and thank her not. Pass on.”
“And you know, too, that in the course of my conversa-
tion with the girl, I let out also incidentally that, even so,

you were dependent on the chances of her life; that if she
died (and youth itself is mortal) before she was of age, the
sum left her by her grandfather would revert to her father's
family; and so, by hints, I drew her on to ask if there was
no mode by which, in case of her death, she might insure
subsistence to you. So that you see the whole scheme was
made at her own prompting. I did but, as a man of busi-
ness, suggest the means—an insurance on her life.”
“Warney, these details are hateful. I do not doubt that
you have done all to forestall inquiry and elude risk. The
girl has insured her life to the amount of her fortune?”
“To that amount only Pooh! Her death will buy
more than that! As no one single office will insure for
more than 5000l., and as it was easy to persuade her that
such offices were liable to failure, and that it was usual to
insure in several, and for a larger amount than the sum
desired, I got her to enter herself at three of the principal
offices. The amount paid to us on her death will be
15,000l. It will be paid (and here I have followed the
best legal advice) in trust to me for your benefit. Hence,
therefore, even if our researches fail us, if no son of yours
can be found, with sufficient evidence to prove, against the
keen interests and bought advocates of heirs-at-law, the
right to Laughton, this girl will repay us well, will replace
what I have taken, at the risk of my neck, perhaps—cer-
tainly at the risk of the hulks, from the capital of my
uncle's legacy—will refund what we have spent on the in-
quiry—and the residue will secure to you an independence
sufficing for your wants almost for life, and to me, what

will purchase with economy” (and Warney smiled) “a year
or so of a gentleman's idle pleasures. Are you satisfied
thus far?”
“She will die happy and innocent!” muttered Lucretia,
with the growl of demoniac disappointment.
“Will you wait, then, till my forgery is detected, and I
have no power to buy the silence of the trustees—wait till
I am in prison, and on a trial for life and death 7 Reflect,
every day, every hour of delay is fraught with peril. But
if my safety is nothing compared to the refinement of your
revenge, will you wait till Helen marries Percival St. John?
You start l But can you suppose that this innocent love-
play will not pass rapidly to its dénouement? It is but
yesterday that Percival confided to me, that he should write
this very day to his mother and communicate all his feel-
ings and his hopes;–that he waited but her assent, to pro-
pose formally for Helen. Now one of two things must
happen. Either this mother, haughty and vain as lady
mothers mostly are, may refuse consent to her son's mar-
riage with the daughter of a disgraced banker, and the
niece of that Lucretia Dalibard whom her husband would
not admit beneath his roof 37
“Hold, sir!” exclaimed Lucretia, haughtily; and amid
all the passions that darkened her countenance and de-
graded her soul some flash of her ancestral spirit shot
across her brow; but it passed quickly, and she added,
with fierce composure—“You are right; go on 1"

from me—either this will be the case: Lady Mary St

John will hasten back in alarm to London; she exercises
extraordinary control over her son; she may withdraw
him from us altogether, from me as well as you, and the
occasion now presented to us may be lost (who knows?)
forever; or she may be a weak and fond woman,—may be
detained in Italy by her sister's illness, may be anxious
that the last lineal descendant of the St. Johns should
marry betimes; and, moved by her darling's prayers, may
consent at once to the union. Or a third course, which
Percival thinks the most probable, and which, though most
unwelcome to us of all, I had well-nigh forgotten, may
be adopted. She may come to England, and, in order
to judge her son's choice with her own eyes, may with-
draw Helen from our roof to hers. At all events, delays
are dangerous—dangerous, putting aside my personal in-
terest, and regarding only your own object—may bring to
our acts new and searching eyes—may cut us off from the
habitual presence either of Percival or Helen, or both; or
surround them at the first breath of illness, with prying
friends and formidable precautions. The birds now are in
our hands. Why then open the cage and bid them fly,
in order to spread the net? This morning all the final
documents with the insurance companies are completed.
It remains for me but to pay the first quarterly premiums.
For that I think I am prepared without drawing further
on your hoards or my own scanty resources, which Grab-
man will take care to drain fast enough.”
“And Percival St. John ” said Madame Dalibard.
“We want no idle sacrifices. If my son be not found,

we need not that boy's ghost among those who haunt
us.”
“Surely not,” said Warney; “and for my part, he may
be more useful to me alive than dead. There is no insu-
rance on his life, and a rich friend (credulous green-horn
that he is 1) is scarcely of that flock of geese which it
were wise to slay from the mere hope of a golden egg.
Percival St. John is your victim, not mine—not till you
give the order would I lift a finger to harm him.”
“Yes, let him live, unless my son be found to me,” said
Madame Dalibard, almost exultingly: “let him live to for-
get yon fair-faced fool, leaning now, see you, so delightedly
on his arm, and fancying eternity in the hollow vows of
lovel—let him live to wrong and abandon her by forget-
fulness, though even in the grave; to laugh at his boyish
dreams—to sully her memory in the arms of harlots 1
Oh, if the dead can suffer, let him live, that she may feel
beyond the grave his inconstancy and his fall! Methinks
that that thought will comfort me, if Wincent be no more,
and I stand childless in the world !”
“It is so settled, then,” said Warney, ever ready to
clinch the business that promised gold, and relieve his
apprehensions of the detection of his fraud. “And now
to your noiseless hands, as soon as may be, I consign the
girl: she has lived long enough 1”

LOVE AND IN NOCEN CE.
WHILE this the conference between these execrable and
ravening birds of night and prey, Helen and her boy-
lover were thus conversing in the garden, while the autumn
sun—for it was in the second week of October—broke
pleasantly through the yellowing leaves of the tranquil
shrubs, and the flowers, which should have died with the
gone summer, still fresh by their tender care, despite the
lateness of the season, smiled gratefully as their light foot-
steps passed.
“Yes, Helen,” said Percival—“yes, you will love my
mother, for she is one of those people who seem to attract
love, as if it were a property belonging to them. Even
my dog Beau (you know how fond Beau is of me!) always
nestles at her feet, when we are at home. I own she has
pride, but it is a pride that never offended any one. You
know there are some flowers that we call proud. The
pride of the flower is not more harmless than my mother's.
But perhaps pride is not the right word—it is rather the
aversion to anything low or mean, the admiration for
everything pure and high. Ah, how that very pride, if
pride it be, will make her love you, my Helen l’

from the first moment you said you had a mother, my heart
leaped to her. Your mother l if ever you are really jeal-
ous, it must be of her l but that she should love me,
that it is what I doubt and fear. For if you were my
brother, Percival, I should be so ambitious for you. A
nymph must rise from the stream, a sylphid from the rose,
before I could allow another to steal you from my side.
And if I think I should feel this only as your sister, what
can be precious enough to satisfy a mother ?”
“You, and you only,” answered Percival, with his blithe-
some laugh—“you, my sweet Helen, much better than
nymph or sylphid, about whom, between ourselves, I never
cared three straws, even in a poem. How pleased you
will be with Laughton I Do you know, I was lying awake
all last night, to consider what room you would like best
for your own. And at last I have decided—come, listen

sons with ease—our mother and myself, your aunt, whom
by that time we shall have petted into good humor, and if
we can coax Ardworth there—the best good fellow that
ever lived—I think our party will be complete. By-the-
way, I am uneasy about Ardworth, it is so long since we
have seen him; I have called three times—nay, five—but
his odd-looking clerk always swears he is not at home.

Tell me, Helen, now, you who know him so well—tell me,
how I can serve him f You know I am so terribly rich
(at least, I shall be in a month or two);—I can never get
through my money, unless my friends will help me. And
is it not shocking that that noble fellow should be so poor,
and yet suffer me to call him ‘friend,' as if in friendship
one man should want everything, and the other nothing.
Still, I don't know how to venture to propose—come, you
understand me, Helen—let us lay our wise heads together,
and make him well off in spite of himself.”
It was in this loose, boyish talk of Percival's, that he
had found the way not only to Helen's heart, but to her
soul. For in this, she (grand undeveloped poetess) recog-
nized a nobler poetry than we chain to rhythm—the poetry
of generous deeds. She yearned to kiss the warm hand
she held, and drew nearer to his side as she answered—
“And sometimes, dear, dear Percival, you wonder why I
would rather listen to you than to all Mr. Warney's bitter
eloquence, or even to my dear cousin's aspiring ambition.
They talk well, but it is of themselves; while you 77
Percival blushed, and checked her.
“Well,” she said—“well, to your question. Alas! you
know little of my cousin, if you think all our arts could
decoy him out of his rugged independence, and, much as
I love him, I could not wish it. But do not fear for him;
he is one of those who are born to succeed, and without
help.”
“How do you know that, pretty prophetess?” said Per-
cival, with the superior air of manhood. “I have seen

more of the world than you have, and I cannot see why
Ardworth should succeed, as you call it;-or, if so, why
he should succeed less if he swung his hammock in a bet-
ter berth than that hole in Gray's Inn, and would just let
me keep him a cab and a groom.”
Had Percival talked of keeping John Ardworth an ele-
phant and a palanquin, Helen could not have been more
amused. She clapped her little hands in a delight that
provoked Percival, and laughed out loud. Then, seeing
her boy-lover's lip pouted petulantly, and his brow was
overcast, she said more seriously:
“Do you not know what it is to feel convinced of some-
thing which you cannot explain? Well, I feel this as to
my cousin's fame and fortunes. Surely, too, you must feel
it, you scarce know why, when he speaks of that future,
which seems so dim and so far to me, as of something that
belonged to him.”
“Wery true, Helen,” said Percival, “he lays it out like
the map of his estate. One can't laugh when he says so
carelessly—‘At such an age I shall lead my circuit—at
such an age I shall be rich—at such an age I shall enter
parliament—and beyond that I shall look as yet no
farther.” And, poor fellow, then he will be forty-threel
And in the mean while to suffer such privations !”
“There are no privations to one who lives in the future,”
said Helen, with that noble intuition into lofty natures
which at times flashed from her childish simplicity, fore-
shadowing what, if Heaven spare her life, her maturer in-
tellect may develop. “For Ardworth there is no such

-
thing as poverty. He is as rich in his hopes as we are
in ” She stopped short, blushed, and continued with
downcast looks—“As well might you pity me in these
walks, so dreary without you. I do not live in them—I
live in my thoughts of you.”
Her voice trembled with emotion in those last words.
She slid from Percival's arm, and timidly sate down (and
he beside her) on a little mound, under the single chestnut-
tree that threw its shade over the garden.
Both were silent for some moments – Percival with
grateful ecstacy, Helen with one of those sudden fits of
mysterious melancholy to which her nature was so sub-
jected.
He was the first to speak. “Helen,” he said, gravely,
“since I have known you, I feel as if life were a more
solemn thing than I ever regarded it before. It seems to
me as if a new and more arduous duty were added to those
for which I was prepared—a duty, Helen, to become worthy
of you! Will you smile? No-you will not smile, if I
say I have had my brief moments of ambition. Some-
times as a boy, with Plutarch in my hand, stretched idly
under the old cedar-trees at Laughton—sometimes as a
sailor, when, becalmed on the Atlantic, and my ears freshly
filled with tales of Collingwood and Nelson, I stole from
my comrades, and leant, musingly, over the boundless sea.
But when this ample heritage passed to me—when I had
no more my own fortunes to make, my own rank to build
up, such dreams became less and less frequent. Is it not
true that wealth makes us contented to be obscure? Yes;

I understand, while I speak, why poverty itself befriends,
not cripples, Ardworth's energies. But since I have known
you, dearest Helen, those dreams return more vividly than
ever. He who claims you, should be—must be—some-
thing nobler than the crowdl Helen "-and he rose by
an irresistible and restless impulse—“I shall not be con-
tented till you are as proud of your choice as I of mine!”
It seemed, as Percival spoke and looked, as if boyhood
were cast from him forever. The unusual weight and
gravity of his words, to which his tone gave even elo-
quence—the steady flash of his dark eyes—his erect, elastic
form—all had the dignity of man. Helen gazed on him
silently, and with a heart so full that words would not
come, and tears overflowed instead.
That sight sobered him at once—he knelt down beside
her, threw his arms around her—it was his first embrace
—and kissed the tears away.
“How have I distressed you?—why do you weep?”
“Let me weep on, Percival, dear Percival! These tears
are like prayers—they speak to Heaven—and of you!”
A step came noiselessly over the grass, and between the
lovers and the sunlight stood Gabriel Werney.

SUDDEN CELEBRITY AND PATIENT HOPE.
PERCIVAL was unusually gloomy and abstracted in his
way to town that day, though Warney was his companion,
and in the full play of those animal spirits which he owed
to his unrivaled physical organization and the obtuseness
of his conscience. Seeing, at length, that his gayety did
not communicate itself to Percival, he paused and looked
at him suspiciously. A falling leaf startles the steed, and
a shadow the guilty man.
“You are sad, Percival?” he said, inquiringly. “What
has disturbed you?”
“It is nothing—or, at least, would seem nothing to you,”
answered Percival, with an effort to smile, “for I have
heard you laugh at the doctrine of presentiments. We
sailors are more superstitious.”
“What presentiment can you possibly entertain?” asked
Warney, more anxiously than Percival could have antici-
pated.
“Presentiments are not so easily defined, Warney. But,
in truth, poor Helen has infected me. Have you not
remarked, that, gay as she habitually is, some shadow
comes over her so suddenly that one cannot trace the
cause f"

“My dear Percival,” said Warney, after a short pause,
“what you say does not surprise me. It would be false
kindness to conceal from you that I have heard Madame
Dalibard say that her mother was, when about her age,
threatened with consumptive symptoms, but she lived
many years afterward. Nay, nay, rally yourself; Helen's
appearance, despite the extreme purity of her complexion,
is not that of one threatened by the terrible malady of our
climate. The young are often haunted with the idea of
early death. As we grow older, that thought is less
cherished; in youth it is a sort of luxury. To this
mournful idea (which you see you have remarked as well
as I) we must attribute not only Helen's occasional mel-
ancholy, but a generosity of forethought, which I cannot
deny myself the pleasure of communicating to you, though
her delicacy would be shocked at my indiscretion. You
know how helpless her aunt’ is. Well, Helen, who is
entitled, when of age, to a moderate competence, has per-
suaded me to insure her life, and accept a trust to hold
the moneys (if ever unhappily due) for the benefit of my
mother-in-law, so that Madame Dalibard may not be left
destitute, if her niece die before she is twenty-one. How
like Helen l—is it not?”
Percival was too overcome to answer.
Warney resumed—“I entreat you not to mention this
to Helen—it would offend her modesty to have the secret
of her good deeds thus betrayed by one to whom alone
she confided them. I could not resist her entreaties;
though, entre nous, it cripples me not a little to advance

for her the necessary sums for the premiums. Apropos,
this brings me to a point on which I feel, as the vulgar
idiom goes, ‘very awkward,'—as I always do in these
confounded money matters. But you were good enough
to ask me to paint you a couple of pictures for Laughton.
Now, if you could let me have some portion of the sum,
whatever it be (for I don't price my paintings to you), it
would very much oblige me.”
Percival turned away his face as he wrung Warney's
hand, and muttered, with a choked voice, “I let me have
my share in Helen's divine forethought. Good heavens !
she, so young, to look thus beyond the grave, always for
others—for others '''
Callous as the wretch was, Percival's emotion and his
proposal struck Warney with a sentiment like compunc-
tion. He had designed to appropriate the lover's gold,
as it was now offered; but that Percival himself should
propose it, blind to the grave to which that gold paved
the way, was a horror not counted in those to which his
fell cupidity and his goading apprehensions had familiar-
ized his conscience.
“No,” he said, with one of those wayward scruples to
which the blackest criminals are sometimes susceptible—
“no. I have promised Helen to regard this as a loan to
her, which she is to repay me when of age. What you
may advance me is for the pictures. I have a right to do
as I please with what is bought by my own labor. And
the subjects of the pictures—what shall they be 7”
“For one picture, try and recall Helen's aspect and

attitude when you came to us in the garden, and entitle
your subject—“The Foreboding.’”
“Hem!” said Warney, hesitatingly. “And the other
subject?” -
“Wait for that, till the joy-bells at Laughton have
welcomed a bride, and then—and then, Warney,” added
Percival, with something of his natural joyous smile, “you
must take the expression as you find it. Once under my
care, and, please Heaven, the one picture shall laughingly
upbraid the other!”
As this was said, the cabriolet stopped at Percival's
door. Warney dined with him that day; and if the con-
versation flagged, it did not revert to the subject which
had so darkened the bright spirits of the host, and so
tried the hypocrisy of the guest. When Warney left,
which he did. as soon as the dinner was concluded, Perci-
val silently put a check into his hands, to a greater amount
than Warney had anticipated even from his generosity.
“This is for four pictures, not two,” he said, shaking his
head; and then, with his characteristic conceit, he added
—“Well, some years hence, the world shall not call them
overpaid. Adieu, my Medici; a dozen such men, and
Art would revive in England.”
When he was left alone, Percival sate down, and, lean-
ing his face on both hands, gave way to the gloom whicli
his native manliness, and the delicacy that belongs to true
affection, had made him struggle not to indulge in the

that hour never had he so intimately and intensely felt

her matchless worth. The image of her unselfish, quiet,
melancholy consideration for that austere, uncaressing, un-
sympathizing relation, under whose shade her young heart
must have withered, seemed to him filled with a celestial
pathos. And he almost hated Warney that the cynic
painter could have talked of it with that business-like
phlegm. The evening deepened; the tranquil street grew
still ; the air seemed close; the solitude oppressed him;
he rose abruptly, seized his hat, and went forth, slowly,
and still with a heavy heart.
As he entered Piccadilly, on the broad step of that
house successively inhabited by the Duke of Queensbury
and Lord Hertford, on the step of that mansion, up
which so many footsteps light with wanton pleasure have
gayly trod, Percival's eye fell upon a wretched, squalid,
ragged object, doubled up, as it were, in that last de-
spondency which has ceased to beg, that has no care to
steal, that has no wish to live. Percival halted, and touched
the outcast.
“What is the matter, my poor fellow 7 Take care—
the policeman will not suffer you to rest here. Come,
cheer up, I say ! There is something to find you a better
lodging !”
The silver fell unheeded on the stones. The thing of
rags did not even raise its head, but a low broken voice
muttered:
“It be too late now—let 'em take me to prison—let
'em send me 'cross the sea to Buttany—let 'em hang me, if
they please. I be’s good for nothin' now—nothin'!”

Altered as the voice was, it struck Percival as familiar.
He looked down and caught a view of the drooping face.
“Up, man, up !” he said, cheerily; “see, Providence
sends you an old friend in need, to teach you never to
despair again.”
The hearty accent, more than the words, touched and
aroused the poor creature. He rose mechanically, and a
sickly grateful smile passed over his wasted features as he
recognized St. John.
“Come! how is this? I have always understood that
to keep a crossing was a flourishing trade nowadays.”
“I 'as no crossin'. I 'as sold her!” groaned Beck. “I
be's good for nothin' now, but to cadge about the streets,
and steal, and filch, and hang like the rest on us! Thank
you, kindly, sir” (and Beck pulled his forelock), “but,
please your 'onor, I would rather make an ind on it!”
“Pooh, pooh! didn't I tell you when you wanted a
friend to come to me? Why did you doubt me, foolish
fellow 7 Pick up those shillings—get a bed and a supper.
Come and see me to-morrow at nine o'clock; you know
where—the same house in Curzon Street: you shall tell
me then your whole story, and it shall go hard but I’ll buy
you another crossing, or get you something just as good.”
Poor Beck swayed a moment or two on his slender legs,
like a drunken man, and then suddenly falling on his knees,
he kissed the hem of his benefactor's garment, and fairly
wept. Those tears relieved him—they seemed to wash
the drought of despair from his heart.
“Hush, hush' or we shall have a crowd round us.

rest—you look, indeed, as if you wanted them. Ah!
would to Heaven all the poverty in this huge city stood
here in thy person, and we could aid it as easily as I can
thee!”
Percival had moved on as he said those last words, and,
looking back, he had the satisfaction to see that Beck was
slowly crawling after him, and had escaped the grim ques-
tion of a very portly policeman, who had no doubt ex-
pressed a natural indignation at the audacity of so ragged
a skeleton not keeping itself respectably at home in its
church-yard.
Entering one of the clubs in St. James's Street, Per-
cival found a small knot of politicians in eager conversation
respecting a new book which had been published but a day
or two before, but which had already seized the public at-
tention with that strong grasp which constitutes always an
era in an author's life, sometimes an epoch in a nation's
literature. The newspapers were full of extracts from the
work—the gossips of conjecture as to the authorship. We
need scarcely say that a book which makes this kind of
sensation must hit some popular feeling of the hour, supply
some popular want. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred,
therefore, its character is political : it was so in the present
instance. It may be remembered that that year parliament
sate during great part of the month of October, that it was
the year in which the Reform Bill was rejected by the
House of Lords, and that public feeling in our time had

never been so keenly excited. This work appeared during
the short interval between the rejection of the bill and the
prorogation of parliament.” And what made it more re-
markable was, that while stamped with the passion of the
time, there was a weight of calm and stern reasoning em-
bodied in its vigorous periods which gave to the argu-
ments of the advocate something of the impartiality of the
judge. Unusually abstracted and unsocial, for, despite
his youth and that peculiar bashfulness before noticed, he
was generally alive enough to all that passed around him,
Percival paid little attention to the comments that cir-
culated round the easy chairs in his vicinity, till a subordi-
nate in the administration, with whom he was slightly
acquainted, pushed a small volume toward him, and said:
“You have seen this, of course, St. John 7 Ten to one
you do not guess the author. It is certainly not B m,
though the Lord Chancellor has energy enough for any-
thing. R says it has a touch of S r.”
“Could M y have written it?” asked a young mem-
ber of parliament, timidly.
“M y!—very like his matchless style, to be surel
You can have read very little of M-y, I should think,”
said the subordinate, with the true sneer of an official and
a critic. -

Percival, with very languid interest, glanced over the

tion for political writings, the passage he opened upon
struck and seized him unawares. Though the sneer of
the official was just, and the style was not comparable to

—the absence of all effeminate glitter—the iron grapple
with the pith and substance of the argument opposed,
seemed familiar to Percival. He thought he heard the
deep bass of John Ardworth's earnest voice, when some
truth roused his advocacy or some falsehood provoked his
wrath. He put down the book bewildered. Could it be
the obscure briefless lawyer in Gray's Inn (that very morn-
ing the object of his young pity) who was thus lifted into
fame? He smiled at his own credulity. But he listened
with more attention to the enthusiastic praises that circled
round, and the various guesses which accompanied them.
Soon, however, his former gloom returned — the Babel
began to chafe and weary him. He rose and went forth
again into the air. He strolled on without purpose, deut

on which the moon rested in solemn splendor; and in that
space one man only shared his solitude. A figure witn
folded arms leant against the iron rails, near the statue of
Canning, and his gaze comprehended in one view the
walls of the parliament, in which all passions wage their
war, and the glorious abbey, which gives a Walhalla to
the great., The utter stillness of the figure, so in unison
with the stillness of the scene, had upon Percival more
effect than would have been produced by the most clamor-
ous crowd. He looked round curiously, as he passed, and
uttered an exclamation, as he recognized John Ardworth.
“You, Percival 1" said Ardworth—“a strange meeting-
place at this hour ! What can bring you hither?”
“Only whim, I fear—and you?” as Percival linked his
arm into Ardworth's.
“Twenty years hence I will tell you what brought me
hither!” answered Ardworth, moving slowly back toward
Whitehall.

“We live till our destinies below are fulfilled; till our
uses have passed from us in this sphere, and rise to benefit

tinction, the sun is confined in its career—day after day, it
visits the same lands, gilds the same planets, or rather, as
the astronomers hold, stands the motionless center of mov-
ing worlds. But the soul, when it sinks into seeming dark-
ness and the deep, rises to new destinies, fresh regions
unvisited before. What we call Eternity, may be but an
endless series of those transitions which men call deaths,

abandonments of home after home, ever to fairer scenes
and loftier heights. Age after age, the spirit, that glori-
ous Nomad, may shift its tent, fated not to rest in the dull
Elysium of the Heathen, but carrying with it evermore its
elements, – Activity and Desire. Why should the soul
ever repose ? God, its Principal, reposes never. While
we speak, new worlds are sparkling forth–suns are throw-
ing off their nebulae—nebulae are hardening into worlds.
The Almighty proves his existence by creating. Think
you that Plato is at rest, and Shakspeare only basking on
a sun-cloud º Labor is the very essence of spirit as of
divinity: labor is the purgatory of the erring; it may oe-
come the hell of the wicked, but labor is not less the
heaven of the good!”
Ardworth spoke with unusual earnestness and passica;
and his idea of the future was emblematic of his own
active nature: for each of us is wisely left to shape out,
amid the impenetrable mists, his own ideal of the Here-
after. The warrior child of the biting North placed his
Hela amid snows, and his Himmel in the banquets of vic-
torious war; the son of the East, parched by relentless
summer—his hell amid fire, and his elysium by cooling
streams; the weary peasant sighs through life for rest, and
rest awaits his vision beyond the grave; the workman of
genius—ever ardent, ever young—honors toil as the glori-
ous development of being—and springs refreshed over the
abyss of the grave—to follow, from star to star, the prog-
ress that seems to him at once the supreme felicity and the
necessary law. So be it with the fantasy of each I Wisdom

“Alas!” said the young listener, “what reproof do you
not convey to those, like me, who, devoid of the power
which gives results to every toil, have little left to them in
life but to idle life away. All have not the gift to write,
or harangue, or speculate, or »
“Friend,” interrupted Ardworth, bluntly, “do not belie
yourself. There lives not a man on earth—out of a lunatic
asylum—who has not in him the power to do good. What
can writers, haranguers, or speculators do more than that?
Have you ever entered a cottage—ever traveled in a coach
—ever talked with a peasant in the field, or loitered with
a mechanic at the loom, and not found that each of those
men had a talent you had not, knew some things you knew
not? The most useless creature that ever yawned at a
club, or counted the vermin on his rags under the suns of
Calabria, has no excuse for want of intellect. What men
want is, not talent, it is purpose;—in other words, not the
power to achieve, but the will to labor. You, Percival Si

plain words the tyranny of eight hundred years.”
“Ardworth, I will not wait your time to tell me what
took you yonder. I have penetrated a secret that you,
not kindly, kept from me. This morning you rose and
found yourself famous; this evening you have come to
gaze upon the scene of the career to which that fame will
more rapidly conduct you 77 -
“And upon the tomb which the proudest ambition I can
form on earth must content itself to win 1 A poor conclu-
sion, if all ended here !”
“I am right, however,” said Percival, with boyish
pleasure. “It is you whose praises have just filled my
ears. You, dear — dear Ardworth ! How rejoiced I
am I?"
Ardworth pressed heartily the hand extended to him :
“I should have trusted you with my secret to-morrow,
Percival; as it is, keep it for the present. A craving of
my nature has been satisfied, a grief has found distraction;
as for the rest, any child who throws a stone into the water
with all his force can make a splash; but he would be a
fool indeed if he supposed that the splash was a sign that
he had turned a stream.”
Here Ardworth ceased abruptly — and Percival, en-
grossed by a bright idea, which had suddenly occurred to
him, exclaimed:
“Ardworth—your desire, your ambition is to enter par-
liament; there must be a dissolution shortly—the success
of your book will render you acceptable to many a popular

sary expenses. Borrow that sum from me—repay me when
you are in the cabinet, or attorney-general. It shall be
so lº º
A look so bright, that even by that dull lamplight the
glow of the cheek, the brilliancy of the eye were visible
—flashed over Ardworth's face. He felt at that moment
what ambitious man must feel when the object he has seen
dimly and afar is placed within his grasp; but his reason
was proof even against that strong temptation.
He passed his arm round the boy's slender waist and
drew him to his heart, with grateful affection, as he re-
plied:
“And what, if now in parliament, giving up my career
—with no regular means of subsistence—what could I be,
but a venal adventurer? Place would become so vitally
necessary to me that I should feed but a dangerous war
between my conscience and my wants. In chasing Fame,
the shadow, I should lose the substance, Independence,—
why, that very thought would paralyze my tongue. No,
no — my generous friend. As labor is the arch elevator
of man, so patience is the essence of labor. First let me
build the foundation, I may then calculate the height of my
tower. First let me be independent of the great—I will
then be the champion of the lowly. Hold l—tempt me no
more—do not lure me to the loss of self-esteem l And
now, Percival,” resumed Ardworth, in the tone of one who
wishes to plunge into some utterly new current of thought
—“let us forget for awhile these solemn aspirations, and

be frolicsome and human. “Nemo mortalium omnibus
horis sapit.” “Neque semper aroum tendit Apollo.' What
say you to a cigar?”
Percival stared. He was not yet familiarized to the
eccentric whims of his friend 1
“Hot negus and a cigar!” repeated Ardworth, while a
smile, full of drollery, played round the corners of his lips,
and twinkled in his deep-set eyes.
“Are you serious 7"
“Not serious—I have been serious enough,” and
Ardworth sighed, “for the last three weeks. Who goes
“to Corinth to be sage,” or to the Cider Cellar to be
serious?”
“I subscribe, then, to the negus and cigar,” said Per-
cival, smiling; and he had no cause to repent his compli-
ance, as he accompanied Ardworth to one of the resorts
favored by that strange person in his rare hours of relax-
ation.
For, seated at his favorite table, which happened,
luckily, to be vacant, with his head thrown carelessly
back, and his negus steaming before him, John Ardworth
continued to pour forth, till the clock struck three, jest
upon jest—pun upon pun—broad drollery upon broad
drollery, without flagging, without intermission—so va-
ried, so copious, so ready, so irresistible, that Percival was
transported out of all his melancholy, in enjoying, for the
first time in his life, the exuberant gayety of a grave mind
once set free—all its intellect sparkling into wit—all its
passion rushing into humor. And this was the man he

THE LOSS OF THE CROSSING.
DESPITE the lateness of the hour before he got to rest,
Percival had already breakfasted, when his valet informed
him, with raised supercilious eyebrows, that “an uncom-
mon ragged sort of a person insisted that he had been told
to call.” Though Beck had been at the house before, and
the valet had admitted him—so much thinner, so much
more ragged was he now, that the trim servant—no close
observer of such folks—did not recognize him. However,
at Percival's order, too well bred to show surprise, he
ushered Beck up with much civility; and St. John was
painfully struck with the ravages a few weeks had made
upon the sweeper's countenance. The lines were so deeply
plowed—the dry hair looked so thin, and was so sown
with gray, that Beck might have beat all Farren's skill in
the part of an old man.
The poor sweeper's tale, extricated from its peculiar
phraseology, was simple enough, and soon told: he had
returned home at night to find his hoards stolen, and the
labor of his life overthrown. How he passed that night
he did not very well remember. We may well suppose
that the little reason he possessed was well-nigh bereft
from him. No suspicion of the exact thief crossed his

perturbed mind. Bad as Grabman's character might be,
he held a respectable-position compared with the other
lodgers in the house. Bill, the cracksman, naturally, and
by vocation, suggested the hand that had despoiled him;
how hope for redress, or extort surrender, from such a
quarter? Mechanically, however, when the hour arrived
to return to his day's task, he stole down the stairs, and
lo, at the very door of the house, Bill's children were at
play, and in the hand of the eldest he recognized what he
called his “curril.”
“Your curril?” interrupted St. John.
“Yes, curril—vot the little uns bite, afore they gets
their teethin'.”
St. John smiled, and supposing that Beck had some
time or other been puerile enough to purchase such a
bauble, nodded to him to continue;—to seize upon the
urchin, and, in spite of kicks, bites, shrieks, or scratches,
repossess himself of his treasure, was the feat of a moment.
The brat's clamor drew out the father—and to him Beck
(pocketing the coral, that its golden bells might not at
tract the more experienced eye, and influence the more
formidable greediness, of the paternal thief) loudly, and
at first fearlessly, appealed. Him he charged, and accused,
and threatened with all vengeance, human and Divine.
Then changing his tone, he implored—he wept—he knelt.
As soon as the startled cracksman recovered his astonish-
ment at such audacity, and comprehended the nature of
the charge against himself and his family, he felt the more
indignant from a strange and unfamiliar consciousness of

innocence. Seizing Beck by the nape of the neck, with a
dextrous application of hand and foot he sent him spin-
ning into the kennel.
“Go to Jericho, mud-scraper!” cried Bill, in a voice of
thunder—“and if ever thou sayst such a vopper agin—
'sparaging the characters of them 'ere motherless babes—
I'll seal thee up in a 'tato sack, and sell thee for fiv'pence
to No. 7, the great body-snatcher. Take care how I ever
sets eyes agin on thy hugly mug l’”
With that Bill clapped to the door, and Beck, frightened
out of his wits, crawled from the kennel, and, bruised and
smarting, crept to his crossing. But he was unable to
discharge his duties that day; his ill-fed, miserable frame
was too weak for the stroke he had received. Long before
dusk he sneaked away, and, dreading to return to his lodg-
ing, lest, since nothing now was left worth robbing but
his carcass, Bill might keep his word, and sell that to the
body-snatcher, he took refuge under the only roof where
he felt he could sleep in safety.
And here we must pause to explain. In our first intro-
duction of Beck, we contented ourselves with implying to
the ingenious and practiced reader, that his heart might
still be large enough to hold something besides his cross-
ing. Now, in one of the small alleys that have their vent
in the great stream of Fleet Street, there dwelt an old
widow woman, who eked out her existence by charing—
an industrious, drudging creature, whose sole occupation
since her husband, the journeyman bricklayer, fell from a

scaffold, and, breaking his neck, left her happily childless,
as well as penniless—had been scrubbing stone-floors, and
cleaning out dingy houses when about to be let,_charing,
in a word. And in this vocation had she kept body and
soul together, till a bad rheumatism and old age had put
an end to her utilities, and entitled her to the receipt of
two shillings weekly from parochial munificence. Between
this old woman and Beck there was a mysterious tie–so
mysterious that he did not well comprehend it himself.
Sometimes he called her “mammy”— sometimes “the
hold crittur.” But certain it is, that to her he was in-
debted for that name which he bore, to the puzzlement of
St. Giles's.
Becky Carruthers was the name of the old woman; but
Becky was one of those good creatures who are always
called by their Christian names, and never rise into the
importance of the surname and the dignity of “Mistress;”
—lopping off the last syllable of the familiar appellation,
the outcast christened himself “Beck.”
“And,” said St. John, who in the course of question
and answer had got thus far into the marrow of the
sweeper's narrative, “is not this good woman really your
mother?”
“Mother!” echoed Beck, with disdain; “no, I 'as a
gritter mother nor she. Sint Poll's is my mother. But
the hold crittur tuk care on me.”
“I really don't understand you. Saint Paul's is your
mother?—How 7"
Beck shook his head mysteriously, and, without answer-

ing the question, resumed the tale, which we must thus
paraphrastically continue to deliver.
When he was a little more than six years old, Beck
began to earn his own livelihood, by running errands,
holding horses, scraping together pence and half-pence.
Betimes, his passion for saving began; at first with a
good and unselfish motive, that of surprising “mammy”
at the week's end. But when “mammy,” who then gained
enough for herself, patted his head and called him good
boy, and bade him save for his own uses, and told him
what a great thing it would be if he could lay by a pretty
penny against he was a man, he turned miser on his own
account; and the miserable luxury grew upon him. At
last, by the permission of the police inspector, strengthened
by that of the owner of the contiguous house, he made his
great step in life, and succeeded a deceased negro in the
dignity and emoluments of the memorable crossing. From
that hour he felt himself fulfilling his proper destiny; but
poor Becky, alas, had already fallen into the sere and
yellow leafl with her decline, her good qualities were im-
paired. She took to drinking—not to positive intoxica-
tion, but to making herself “comfortable;”— and, to satisfy
her craving, Beck, waking betimes one morning, saw her
emptying his pockets. Then he resolved, quietly and with-
out upbraiding her, to remove to a safer lodging. To save
had become the imperative necessity of his existence. But
to do him justice, Beck had a glimmering sense of what
was due to the “hold crittur.” Every Saturday evening,
he called at her house and deposited with her a certain

sum, not large even in proportion to his earnings, but
which seemed to the poor ignorant miser, who grudged
every farthing to himself, an enormous deduction from his
total, and a sum sufficient for every possible want of hu-
mankind even to satiety. And now, in returning, de-
spoiled of all, save the few pence he had collected that
day, it is but fair to him to add that not his least bitter
pang was in the remembrance that this was the only
Saturday on which, for the first time, the weekly stipend
would fail.
But so ill and so wretched did he look when he reached
her little room, that “mammy” forgot all thought of her-
self; and when he had told his tale, so Kºnd was her comfort-
ing, so unselfish her sympathy, that his heart smote him for
his old parsimony, for his hard resentment at her single
act of peculation;–had not she the right to all he made?
But remorse and grief alike soon vanished in the fever
that now seized him; for several days he was insensible:
and when he recovered sufficiently to be aware of what
was around him, he saw the widow seated beside him,
within four bare walls, everything, except the bed he
slept on, had been sold to support him in his illness. As
soon as he could totter forth, Beck hastened to his cross-
ing—alas, it was preoccupied His absence had led to
ambitious usurpation. A one-legged, sturdy sailor had
mounted his throne and wielded his scepter. The de-
corum of the street forbade altertation to the contending
parties; but the sailor referred discussion to a meeting at
a flash house in the Rookery that evening. There, a jury

was appointed, and the case opened. By the conventional
laws that regulate this useful community, Beck was still in
his rights; his reappearance sufficed to restore his claims,
and an appeal fo the policeman would no doubt re-establish
his authority. But Beck was still so ill and so feeble that
he had a melancholy persuasion that he could not suitably
perform the duties of his office; and when the sailor, not a
bad fellow on the whole, offered to pay down on the nail
what really seemed a very liberal sum for Beck's peaceful
surrender of his rights, the poor wretch thought of the
bare walls at his “mammy's,” of the long, dreary interval
that must elapse, even if able to work, before the furniture
pawned could be redeemed by the daily profits of his post,
and, with a groan, he held out his hand and concluded the
bargain.
Creeping home to the “hold crittur,” he threw the pur-
chase-money into her lap; then, broken-hearted, and in
despair, he slunk forth again in a sort of vague, dreamy
hope that the law, which abhors vagabonds, would seize
and finish him.
When this tale was done, Percival did not neglect the
gentle task of admonition, which the poor sweeper's soft-
ened heart and dull remorse made the easier. He pointed
out, in soft tones, how the avarice he had indulged had
been, perhaps, mercifully chastised; and drew no inelo-
quent picture of the vicious miseries of the confirmed
miser. Beck listened humbly and respectfully, though so
little did he understand of mercy, and Providence, and
vice, that the diviner part of the homily was quite lost on

him. However, he confessed penitently that “the mat-
tress had made him worse nor a beast to the hold crittur;”
and that “he was cured of saving to the end of his days.”
“And now,” said Percival, “as you really seem not
strong enough to bear this out-of-door work (the winter
coming on, too), what say you to entering into my service f
I want some help in my stables. The work is easy enough;
and you are used to horses, you know, in a sort of a way.”
Beck hesitated, and looked a moment undecided. At
last, he said, “Please your 'onor, if I beant strong enough
for the crossin', I'se afeard I'm too hailing to sarve you.
And wouldn't I be worse nor a wiper, to take your wages,
and not work for 'em has I hought !”
“Pooh, we'll soon make you strong, my man. Take my
advice—don't let your head run on the crossing. That
kind of industry exposes you to bad company and bad
thoughts.”
“That's vot it is, sir,” said Beck, assentingly, laying his
dexter forefinger on his sinister palm.
“Well! you are in my service, then. Go down stairs
now, and get your breakfast;-by-and-by, you shall show
me your “mammy's' house, and we'll see what can be done
for her.”
Beck pressed his hands to his eyes, trying hard not to
cry; but it was too much for him; and as the valet, who
appeared to Percival's summons, led him down the stairs,
his sobs were heard from attic to basement.

NEW S FROM GRAB MAN.
THAT day, opening thus auspiciously to Beck, was
memorable also to other and more prominent persons in
this history.
Early in the forenoon a parcel was brought to Madame
Dalibard which contained Ardworth's already famous
book, a goodly assortment of extracts from the newspa-
pers thereon, and the following letter from the young
author:
“You will see, by the accompanying packet, that your
counsels have had weight with me. I have turned aside
in my slow legitimate career. I have, as you desired,
made “men talk of me.” What solid benefit I may reap
from this, I know not. I shall not openly avow the book.
Such notoriety cannot help me at the bar. But, liberavi
animam meam—excuse my pedantry—I have let my soul
free for a moment—I am now catching it back, to put bit
and saddle on again. I will not tell you how you have
disturbed me—how you have stung me into this premature
rush amid the crowd—how, after robbing me of name and
father, you have driven me to this experiment with my
own mind, to see if I was deceived, when I groaned to

shall be your mother.” I am satisfied with the experiment.
I know better now what is in me: and I have regained
my peace of mind. If, in the success of this hasty work,
there be that which will gratify the interest you so kindly
take in me, deem that success your own: I owe it to you
—to your revelations—to your admonitions. I wait
patiently your own time for further disclosures; till then,
the wheel must work on, and the grist be ground. Kind
and generous friend, till now I would not wound you by
returning the sum you sent me —nay, more, I knew I
should please you by devoting part of it to the risk of
giving this essay to the world, and so making its good
fortune doubly your own work. Now, when the publisher
smiles, and the shopmen bow, and I am acknowledged to
have a bank in my brains,—now, you cannot be offended
to receive it back. Adieu. When my mind is in train
again, and I feel my step firm on the old dull road, I will

Not at the noble thoughts, and the deep sympathy with
mankind, that glowed through that work over which Lu-
cretia now tremulously hurried, did she feel delight. All
that she recognized or desired to recognize, were those
evidences of that kind of intellect which wins its way
through the world, and which, strong and unmistakable,
rose up in every page of that vigorous logic and com:

manding style. The book was soon dropped thus read:
the newspaper extracts pleased even more.
“This,” she said, audibly, in the freedom of her solitude
—“this is the son I asked for—a son in whom I can rise
—in whom I can exchange the sense of crushing infamy
for the old delicious ecstasy of pride l For this son can I
do too much 7 No; in what I may do for him, methinks
there will be no remorse! And he calls his success mine
—mine !” Her nostrils dilated, and her front rose
erect.
In the midst of this exultation, Warney found her, and
before he could communicate the business which had
brought him, he had to listen, which he did with the secret
gnawing envy that every other man's success occasioned
him, to her baughty self-felicitations.
He could not resist saying, with a sneer, when she
paused, as if to ask his sympathy,
“All this is very fine, belle mere; and yet I should
hardly have thought that coarse-featured, uncouth limb of
the law, who seldom moves without upsetting a chair—
never laughs but the panes rattle in the window—I should
hardly have thought him the precise person to gratify your
pride, or answer the family ideal of a gentleman and a St.
John.”

tongue, and it is folly in me to resent those privileges
which our fearful connection gives you. But—this rail-

Warney, who, dreading nothing else, dreaded much the
rebuke of his grim stepmother.
“It is forgiven,” said Lucretia, coldly, and with a slight
wave of her hand; then she added, with composure,
“Long since—even while heiress of Laughton—I parted
with mere pride in the hollow seemings of distinction.
Had I not, should I have stooped to William Mainwar-
ing 7 What I then respected, amid all the degradations I
have known, I respect still; talent, ambition, intellect, and
will. Do you think I would exchange these in a son of
mine, for the mere graces which a dancing-master can sell
him f Fear not! Let us give but wealth to that intellect,
and the world will see no clumsiness in the movements that
march to its high places, and hear no discord in the laugh
that triumphs over fools l But you have some news to
communicate, or some proposal to suggest.”
“I have both,” said Warney. “In the first place, I
have a letter from Grabman l’”
Lucretia's eyes sparkled, and she snatched eagerly at
the letter her son-in-law drew forth. -
“Liverpool, October, 1831.
“JASON,-I think I am on the road to success. Having
first possessed myself of the fact, commemorated in the
parish register, of the birth and baptism of Alfred Brad-

I next set my wits to work to trace that son's exodus from
the paternal mansion. I have hunted up an old woman-
servant, Jane Prior, who lived with the Braddells. She

now thrives as a laundress; she is a rank puritan, and
starches for the godly. She was at first very wary and
reserved in her communications, but by siding with her
prejudices and humors, and by the intercession of the Rev.
Mr. Graves (of her own persuasion), I have got her to open
her lips. It seems that these Braddells lived very unhap-
pily—the husband, a pious dissenter, had married a lady
who turned out of a very different practice and belief.
Jane Prior pitied her master, and detested her mistress.
Some circumstances in the conduct of Mrs. Braddell made
the husband, who was then in his last illness, resolve, from
a point of conscience, to save his child from what he deemed
the contamination of her precepts and example. Mrs.
Braddell was absent from Liverpool, on a visit, which was
thought very unfeeling by the husband's friends; during
this time Braddell was visited constantly by a gentleman
(Mr. Ardworth) who differed from him greatly in some
things, and seemed one of the carnal; but with whom
agreement in politics (for they were both great politicians
and republicans) seems to have established a link. One
evening, when Mr. Ardworth was in the house, Jane Prior,
who was the only maid-servant (for they kept but two,
and one had been just discharged), had been sent out to
the apothecary's. On her return, Jane Prior, going into
the nursery, missed the infant; she thought it was with
her master, but coming into his room, Mr. Braddell told
her to shut the door, informed her that he had intrusted
the boy to Mr. Ardworth, to be brought up in a righteous
and pious manner, and implored and commanded her to

keep this a secret from his wife, whom he was resolved,
indeed, if he lived, not to receive back into his house.
Braddell, however, did not survive more than two days
this event. On his death, Mrs. Braddell returned; but
circumstances connected with the symptoms of his malady,
and a strong impression which haunted himself, and with
which he had infected Jane Prior, that he had been poi-
soned, led to a posthumous examination of his remains.
No trace of poison was however discovered, and suspicions
that had been directed against his wife could not be sub-
stantiated by law; still, she was regarded in so unfavor-
able a light by all who had known them both, she met
with such little kindness or sympathy in her widowhood,
and had been so openly denounced by Jane Prior, that it
is not to be wondered at that she left the place as soon as
possible. The house, indeed, was taken from her, for
Braddell's affairs were found in such confusion, and his
embarrassments so great, that everything was seized and
sold off; nothing left for the widow, nor for the child (if
the last were ever discovered).
“As may be supposed, Mrs. Braddell was at first very
clamorous for the lost child, but Jane Prior kept her
promise, and withheld all clew to it. And Mrs. Braddell
was forced to quit the place in ignorance of what had be-
come of it; since then no one had heard of her, but Jane
Prior says that she is sure “she had come to no good.”
Now, though much of this may be, no doubt, familiar to
you, dear Jason, it is right, when I put the evidence be-
fore you, that you should know and guard against what

to expect; and in any trial at law to prove the identity
of Vincent Braddell, Jane Prior must be a principal wit-
ness, and will certainly not spare poor Mrs. Braddell. For
the main point, however, viz., the suspicion of poisoning
her husband, the inquest and verdict may set aside all
alarm.
“My next researches have been directed on the track of
Walter Ardworth, after leaving Liverpool, which (I find
by the books at the inn where he lodged and was known)
he did in debt to the innkeeper, the very night he received
the charge of the child. Here, as yet, I am in fault; but
I have ascertained that a woman, one of the sect, of the
name of Joplin, living in a village fifteen miles from the
town, had the care of some infant to replace her own,
which she had lost. I am going to this village to-morrow.
But I cannot expect much in that quarter, since it would
seem at variance with your more probable belief that Wal-
ter Ardworth took the child at once to Mr. Fielden's.
However, you see I have already gone very far in the evi-
dence;—the birth of the child—the delivery of the child
to Ardworth. I see a very pretty case already before us,
and I do not now doubt for a moment of ultimate success.
“Yours, N. GRABMAN.”
Lucretia read steadily, and with no change of counte-
nance, to the last line of the letter. Then, as she put it
down on the table before her, she repeated, with a tone of
deep exultation—“No doubt of ultimate success!”
“You do not fear to brave all which the spite of this

woman, Jane Prior, may prompt her to say against you?”
asked Warney.
Lucretia's brow fell. “It is another torture,” she said,
“even to own my marriage with a low-born hypocrite. But
I can endure it for the cause,” she added, more haughtily.
“Nothing can really hurt me in these obsolete aspersions
and this vague scandal. The inquest acquitted me, and
the world will be charitable to the mother of him who has
wealth and rank, and that vigorous genius which, if proved
in obscurity, shall command opinion in renown.”
“You are now, then, disposed at once to proceed to
action. For Helen, all is prepared—the insurances set-
tled—the trust for which I hold them on your behalf is
signed and completed. But for Percival St. John, I await
your directions. Will it be best first to prove your son's
identity, or when morally satisfied that that proof is forth-
coming, to remove betimes both the barriers to his inher-
itance? If we tarry for the last, the removal of St. John
becomes more suspicious than it does at a time when you
have no visible interest in his death. Besides, now we
have the occasion, or can make it—can we tell how long it
will last? Again, it will seem more natural that the lover
should break his heart in the first shock of xy
“Ay,” interrupted Lucretia, “I would have all thought
and contemplation of crime at an end, when, clasping my
boy to my heart, I can say—‘Your mother's inheritance is
yours.' I would not have a murder before my eyes, when
they should look only on the fair prospects beyond. I
would cast back all the hideous images of horror into the

rear of memory, so that hope may for once visit me again
undisturbed. No, Gabriel, were I to speak forever, you
would comprehend not what I grasp at in a son l It is at
a future l Rolling a stone over the sepulcher of the past
—it is as a resurrection into a fresh world—it is to know
again one emotion not impure—one scheme not criminal.
It is, in a word, to cease to be as myself, to think in an-
other soul, to hear my heart beat in another form. All
this I covet in a son. And when all this should smile
before me in his image, shall I be plucked back again into
my hell by the consciousness that a new crime is to be
done? No; wade quickly through the passage of blood,
that we may dry our garments and breathe the air upon
the bank where sun shines and flowers bloom l’”
“So be it, then l’” said Warney. “Before the week is
out, I must be under the same roof as St. John.—Before
the week is out, why not all meet in the old halls of Laugh-
ton 7”
“Ay, in the halls of Laughton 1 on the hearth of our
ancestors the deeds done for our descendants look less
dark!”
“And first, to prepare the way, Helen should sicken in
these fogs of London, and want change of air.”
“Place before me that desk. I will read William Main-
waring's letters again and again, till from every shadow in

VARIETIES.
LEAving the guiltv pair to concert their schemes, and
indulge their atrocious hopes, we accompany Percival to
the hovel occupied by Becky Carruthers.
On following Beck into the room she rented, Percival
was greatly surprised to find, seated comfortably on the
only chair to be seen no less a person than the worthy
Mrs. Mivers. This good lady, in her spinster days, had
earned her own bread by hard work She had captivated
Mr. Mivers when but a simple housemaid in the service of
one of his relations. And while this humble condition in
her earlier life may account for much in the language and
manners which is nowadays inconsonant with the breed-
ing and education that characterize the wives of opulent
tradesmen, so perhaps the remembrance of it made her
unusually susceptible to the duties of charity For there
is no class of society more prone to pity and relieve the
poor than females in domestic service; and this virtue
Mrs. Mivers had not laid aside, as many do, so soon as
she was in a condition to practice it with effect Mrs.
Mivers blushed scarler on being detected in her visit of
kindness, and hastened to excuse nerself by the informa-
tion that she belonged to a society of ladies or “the Bet-
tering the Condition of the Poor,” and that having just

been informed of Mrs. Becky's destitute state, she had
looked in to recommend her—a ventilator!
“It's quite shocking to see how little the poor attends
to the proper wentilating their houses. No wonder there's
so much typus about !” said Mrs. Mivers. “And for one-
and-sixpence, we can introduce a stream of hair that goes
up the chimbly and carries away all that it finds !”
“I 'umbly thank you, marm,” said the poor bundle of
rags that went by the name of “Becky,” as, with some dif.
ficulty, she contrived to stand in the presence of the be-
nevolent visitor; “but, I’m much afeard, that the hair
will make the rheumatiz werry rumpatious!”
“On the contrary—on the contrary,” said Mrs. Mivers
triumphantly, and she proceeded philosophically to ex-
plain, that all the fevers, aches, pains, and physical ills
that harass the poor, arise from the want of an air-trap in
the chimney and a perforated net-work in the window-
pane. Becky listened patiently; for Mrs. Mivers was
only a philosopher in her talk, and she had proved herself
anything but a philosopher in her actions, by the spon-
taneous present of five shillings, and the promise of a
basket of vituals, and some good wine to keep the cold
wind she invited to the apartment out of the stomach.
Percival imitated the silence of Becky, whose spirit was
so bowed down by an existence of drudgery, that not even
the sight of her fosterson could draw her attention from
the respect due to a superior.
“And is this poor cranky-looking cretur your son, Mrs.
Becky?” said the visitor, struck at last by the appearance

of the ex-sweeper as he stood at the threshold, hat in
hand.
“No, indeed, marm,” answered Becky; “I often says
—says I– child, you be the son of Sint Poll's.”
Beck smiled proudly.
“It was agin the grit church, marm—but it's a long
story. My poor good man had not a long been dead—as
good a man as hever lived, marm,” and Becky dropped a
curtsy; “he fell off a scaffol, and pitched right on his
'ead—or I should not have come on the parish, marm—
and that's the truth on't!”
“Very well, I shall call and hear all about it—a sad
case, I dare say. You see, your husband should have sub-
scribed to our Loan Society, and then they'd have found
him a 'andsome coffin, and given three pounds to his wid-
der. But the poor are so benighted in these parts. I'm
sure, sir, I can't guess what brought you here?—but that's
no business of mine. And how are all at Old Brompton?”
—here Mrs. Mivers bridled indignantly. “There was a
time when Miss Mainwaring was very glad to come and
chat with Mr. M. and myself; but now ‘rum has riz," as
the saying is—not but what I dare say it's not her fault,
poor thing!—that stiff aunt of hers—she need not look so
high—pride and poverty, forsooth !”
While delivering these conciliatory sentences, Mrs. Mi-
vers had gathered up her gown, and was evidently in the
bustle of departure. As she now nodded to Becky, Per-
cival stepped up, and, with his irresistible smile, offered
her his arm. Much surprised, and much flattered, Mrs.

Mivers accepted it. As she did so, he gently detained
ner, while he said to Becky:
“My good friend, I have brought you the poor lad, to
whom you have been a mother, to tell you that good deeds
find their reward sooner or later. As for him, make your-
self easy; he will inform you of the new step he has taken;
and for you, good, kind-hearted creature, thank the boy
you brought up, if your old age shall be made easy and
cheerful. Now, Beck, silly lad, go and tell all to your
nurse! Take care of this step, Mrs. Mivers.”
As soon as he was in the street, Percival, who, if amused
at the ventilator, had seen the five shillings gleam on
Becky's palm, and felt that he had found under the puce-
colored gown a good woman's heart to understand him,
gave Mrs. Mivers a short sketch of poor Beck's history
and misfortunes, and so contrived to interest her in behalf
of the nurse, that she willingly promised to become Per-
cival's almoner, to execute his commission, to improve the
interior of Becky's abode, and distribute weekly the liberal
stipend he proposed to settle on the old widow. They
had grown, indeed, quite friendly and intimate, by the
time he reached the smart, plate-glazed, mahogany-colored
façade, within which the flourishing business of Mr. Mivers
was carried on ; and when, knocking at the private door,
promptly opened by a lemon-colored page, she invited him
up stairs, it so chanced that the conversation had slid off
to Helen, and Percival was sufficiently interested to bow
assent and to enter.
Though all the way up the stairs, Mrs. Mivers, turning

back at every other step, did her best to impress upon her
young visitor's mind the important fact that they kept
their household establishment at their “willer,” and that
their apartments in Fleet Street were only a “conweni-
ence,”—the store set by the worthy housewife upon her
goods and chattels was sufficiently visible in the drugget
that threaded its narrow way up the gay Brussels stair-
carpet, and in certain layers of paper, which protected
from the profanation of immediate touch the mahogany
hand-rail. And nothing could exceed the fostering care
exhibited in the drawing-room, when, the door thrown
open, admitted a view of its damask moreen curtains,
pinned back from such impertinent sunbeams as could
force their way through the foggy air of the east into the
windows, and the ells of yellow muslin that guarded the
frames, at least, of a collection of colored prints, and two
kit-kat portraitures of Mr. Mivers and his lady, from the
perambulations of the flies.
But Percival's view of this interior was somewhat im-
peded by his portly guide, who, uttering a little exclama-
tion of surprise, stood motionless on the threshold, as she
perceived Mr. Mivers seated by the hearth in close con-
ference with a gentleman whom she had never seen before.
At that hour, it was so rare an event in the life of Mr.
Mivers to be found in the drawing-room, and that he
should have an acquaintance unknown to his helpmate,
was a circumstance so much rarer still, that Mrs. Mivers
may well be forgiven for keeping St. John standing at the
door till she had recovered her amaze.


## p. 153 (#511) ############################################

LUCRETIA. 153
Meanwhile, Mr. Mivers rose in some confusion, and was
apparently about to introduce his guest, when that gentle-
man coughed and pinched the host's arm significantly.
Mr. Mivers coughed also, and stammered out—“A gentle-
man, Mrs. M.—a friend;—stay with us a day or two.
Much honored—hum !”
Mrs. Mivers stared and curtsied, and stared again.
But there was an open, good-humored smile in the face
of the visitor, as he advanced and took her hand, that
attracted a heart very easily conciliated. Seeing that that
was no moment for further explanation, she plumped her-
self into a seat, and said:
“But bless us and save us, I am keeping you standing,
Mr. St. Johnſº
“St. John "repeated the visitor, with a vehemence that
startled Mrs. Mivers.
“Your name is St. John, sir—related to the St. Johns
of Laughton "
“Yes, indeed,” answered Percival, with his shy, arch
smile, “Laughton at present has no worthier owner than
myself.”
The gentleman made two strides to Percival, and shook
him heartily by the hand.
“This is pleasant, indeed!” he exclaimed. “You must
excuse my freedom; but I knew well poor old Sir Miles,
and my heart warms at the sight of his representative.”
Percival glanced at his new acquaintance, and on the
whole was prepossessed in his favor. He seemed some-
where on the sunnier side of fifty, with that superb yellow

bronze of complexion which betokens long residence under
Eastern skies. Deep wrinkles near the eyes, and a dark
circle round them, spoke of cares and fatigue, and perhaps
dissipation. But he had evidently a vigor of constitution
that had borne him passably through all; his frame was
wiry and nervous; his eye bright and full of life; and
there was that abrupt, unsteady, mercurial restlessness in
his movements and manner, which usually accompanies the
mun whose sanguine temperament prompts him to concede
to the impulse, and who is blessed or cursed with a super-
abundance of energy according as circumstance may favor,
or judgment correct, that equivocal gift of constitution.
Percival said something appropriate in reply to so much
cordiality paid to the account of the Sir Miles whom he
had never seen, and seated himself—coloring slightly under
the influence of the fixed, pleased, and earnest look still
bent upon him.
Searching for something else to say, Percival asked Mrs.
Mivers if she had lately seen John Ardworth.
The guest, who had just reseated himself, turned his
chair round at that question with such vivacity that Mrs.
Mivers heard it crack. Her chairs were not meant for
such usage. A shade fell over her rosy countenance as
she replied:
“No, indeed (please, sir, them chairs is brittle)! No,
—he is like Madam at Brompton, and seldom condescends
to favor us now. It was but last Sunday we asked him to
dinner. I am sure he need not turn up his nose at our
roast beef and pudding !”

Here Mr. Mivers was taken with a violent fit of cough-
ing, which drew off his wife's attention. She was afraid
he had taken cold.
The stranger took out a large snuff-box, inhaled a long
pinch of snuff, and said to St. John:
“This Mr. John Ardworth, a pert enough Jackanapes,
I suppose—a limb of the law, eh?”
“Sir,” said Percival, gravely; “John Ardworth is my
particular friend. It is clear that you know very little of
him.”
“That's true,” said the stranger—“’pon my life, that's
very true. But I suppose he's like all lawyers—cunning
and tricky, conceited and supercilious, full of prejudice
and cant, and a red-hot tory into the bargain. I know
them, sir—I know them "
“Well,” answered St. John, half gayly, half angrily,
“your general experience serves you very little here; for
Ardworth is exactly the opposite of all you have de-
scribed.”
“Even in politics?”
“Why, I fear he is half a Radical—certainly more than
a Whig,” answered St. John, rather mournfully; for his
own theories were all the other way, notwithstanding his
unpatriotic forgetfulness of them in his offer to assist
Ardworth's entrance into parliament.
“I am very glad to hear it,” cried the stranger, again
taking snuff. “And this Madam at Brompton—perhaps
I know her a little better than I do young Mr. Ardworth
—Mrs. Brad–I mean Madame Dalibard!” and the stranger

glanced at Mr. Mivers, who was slowly recovering from
some vigorous slaps on the back, administered to him by
his wife, as a counter-irritant to the cough. “Is it true
that she has lost the use of her limbs?”
Percival shook his head.
“And takes care of poor Helen Mainwaring, the orphan 7
Well, well ! that looks amiable enough. I must see—I
must see!”
“Who shall I say inquired after her, when I see Madame
Dalibard?” asked Percival, with some curiosity.
“Who? Oh, Mr. Tomkins. She will not recollect him,
though,”— and the stranger laughed, and Mr. Mivers
laughed, too; and Mrs. Mivers, who, indeed, always
laughed when other people laughed, laughed also. So
Percival thought he ought to laugh for the sake of good
company, and all laughed together, as he arose and took
leave.
He had not, however, got far from the house, on his
way to his cabriolet, which he had left by Temple Bar,
when, somewhat to his surprise, he found Mr. Tomkins at
his elbow.
“I beg your pardon, Mr. St. Johu, but I have only just
returned to England, and on such occasions a man is apt
to seem curious. This young lawyer; you see the elder
Ardworth—(a good-for-nothing scamp 1)—was a sort of
friend of mine—not exactly friend, indeed, for, by Jove, I
think he was a worse friend to me than he was to anybody
else,—still I had a foolish interest for him, and should be

“What the devil, sir! Do you take the father's part as

“I don't know anything about Mr. Ardworth, senior,”
said Percival, pouting; “but I do know that my friend
would not allow any one to speak ill of his father in his
presence; and I beg you, sir, to consider that whatever
would offend him must offend me.”
“Gad's my life He's the luckiest young rogue to have
such a friend. Sir, I wish you a very good day.”
Mr. Tomkins took of his hat—bowed—and passing St.
John with a rapid step, was soon lost to his eye among
the crowd hurrying westward.
But our business being now rather with him than Per-
cival, we leave the latter to mount his cabriolet, and we
proceed with Mr. Mivers's mercurial guest on his eccentric
way through the throng.
There was an odd mixture of thoughtful abstraction and
quick observation in the soliloquy in which this gentleman
indulged, as he walked briskly on.

hands into his pockets and laughed, as the jingle of coin
reached his ear through the din without. “Well, I must
make haste to decide; for, really, there is a very trouble-

In such cogitations and mental remarks our traveler
whiled away the time, till he found himself in Piccadilly.
There, a publisher's shop (and he had that keen eye for
shops which betrays the stranger in London), with its new
publications exposed at the window, attracted his notice.

Conspicuous among the rest was the open title-page of a
book, at the foot of which was placed a placard, with the
enticing words—“FourTH EDITION: JUST ouT,” in red
capitals. The title of the work struck his irritable curious
fancy; he walked into the shop—asked for the volume—
and while looking over the contents, with muttered ejacu-
lations: “Good l—capital l why this reminds one of
Horne Tooke I What's the price? very dear—must have
it though—must. Ha! haſ home-thrust there!”—while
thus turning over the leaves, and rending them asunder
with his forefinger, regardless of the paper-cutter extended
to him by the shopman, a gentleman pushing by him,
asked if the publisher was at home; and as the shopman,
bowing very low, answered, “Yes,” the new-comer darted
into a little recess behind the shop. Mr. Tomkins, who
had looked up very angrily on being jostled so uncere-
moniously, started and changed color when he saw the
face of the offender. “Saints in heaven " he murmured
almost audibly; “what a look of that woman l and yet—
no—it is gone !”
“Who is that gentleman?” he asked, abruptly, as he
paid for his book.
The shopman smiled, but answered, “I don't know,
sir.”
“That's a lie!—you would never bow so low to a man
you did not know !”
The shopman smiled again. “Why, sir, there are many
who come to this house who don't wish us to know them.”
“Ah, I understand l you are political publishers—afraid

country, and then they tell us we are ‘free!” So I suppose
that gentleman has written something William Pitt does
not like. But, William Pitt'—ha—he's dead!—very true,
so he is l Sir, this little book seems most excellent; but,
in my time, a man would have been sent to Newgate for
printing it.”
While thus running on, Mr. Tomkins had edged himself
pretty close to the recess, within which the last comer had
disappeared; and there, seated on a high stool, he contrived
to read and to talk at the same time, but his eye and his
ear were both turned every instant toward the recess.
The shopman, little suspecting that in so very eccentric,
garrulous a person, he was permitting a spy to encroach
upon the secrets of the house, continued to make up sundry
parcels of the new publication which had so enchanted his
customer, while he expatiated on the prodigious sensation
the book had created; and while the customer himself had
already caught enough of the low conversation within the
recess to be aware that the author of the book was the
very person who had so roused his curiosity.
Not till that gentleman, followed to the door by the
polite publisher, had quitted the shop, did Mr. Tomkins
put his volume in his pocket, and, with a familiar nod at
the shopman, take himself off.
He was scarcely in the street, when he saw Percival St.
John leaning out of his cabriolet and conversing with the
author he had discovered. He halted a moment, irresolute,
but the young man, in whom our reader recognizes John

Ardworth, declining St. John's invitation to accompany,
him to Brompten, resumed his way through the throng;
the cabriolet drove on; and Mr. Tomkins, though with a
graver mien, and a steadier step, continued his desultory
rambles. Meanwhile, John Ardworth strode gloomily
back to his lonely chamber.
There, throwing himself on the well-worn chair before
the crowded desk, he buried his face in his hands, and for
some minutes he felt all that profound despondency pecu-
liar to those who have won fame, to add to the dark volume
of experience the conviction of fame's nothingness. For
some minutes, he felt an illiberal and ungrateful envy of
St. John—so fair, so light-hearted, so favored by fortune,
so rich in friends—in a mother's love, and in Helen's half.

toils or gladden the sports of childhood—no father's cheer-
ing word up the steep hill of man And Helen, for whose
sake he had so often, when his heart grew weary, nerved
himself again to labor, saying—“Let me be rich, let me be

that strangers praised, and the babble of the world's run-

its way. In the bitterness of his mood, he was unjust to
his rival. All that exquisite, but half-concealed treasure
of imagination and thought, which lay beneath the surface
of Helen's childlike smile, he believed that he alone—he,

soul of power and son of genius, was worthy to discover
and to prize. In the pride not unfrequent with that king-
liest of all aristocracies, the Chiefs of Intellect, he forgot
the grandeur which invests the attributes of the heart—
forgot that, in the lists of love, the heart is at least the
equal of the mind. In the reaction that follows great
excitement, Ardworth had morbidly felt, that day, his utter
solitude—felt it in the streets through which he had passed
—in the home to which he had returned—the burning tears,
shed for the first time since childhood, forced themselves
through his clasped fingers. At length he rose with a
strong effort at self-mastery—some contempt of his weak-
ness, and much remorse at his ungrateful envy. He gath-
ered together the soiled manuscript and dingy proofs of
his book, and thrust them through the grimy bars of his
grate; then, opening his desk, he drew out a small packet,
with tremulous fingers unfolding paper after paper, and
gazed with eyes still moistened, on the relics kept till then,
in the devotion of the only sentiment inspired by Eros,
that had ever, perhaps, softened his iron nature: these
were two notes from Helen—some violets she had once
given him, and a little purse she had knitted for him (with
a playful prophecy of future fortunes) when he had last
left the vicarage. Nor blame him, ye who with more
habitual romance of temper, and richer fertility of imag-
ination, can reconcile the tenderest memories with the
sternest duties, if he, with all his strength, felt that the
associations connected with those tokens would but ener-
vate his resolves and embitter his resignation. You can

guess not the extent of the sacrifice, the bitterness of the
pang, when, averting his head, he dropped those relics on
the hearth. The evidence of the desultory ambition, the
tokens of the visionary love—the same flame leapt up to
devour both ! It was as the funeral pyre of his youth !
“Sol" he said to himself, “let all that can divert me
from the true ends of my life—consume 1–Labor, take
back your son.”
An hour afterward, and his clerk, returning home, found
Ardworth employed as calmly as usual on his Law Reports.

CHA PTE R XVI.
THE INVITATION TO LAUGHTON.
THAT day, when he called at Brompton, Percival re-
ported to Madame Dalibard his interview with the eccen-
tric Mr. Tomkins. Lucretia seemed chafed and discon-
certed by the inquiries with which that gentleman had
honored her, and as soon as Percival had gone, she sent
for Warney. He did not come till late—she repeated to
him what St. John had said of the stranger. Warney
participated in her uneasy alarm. The name, indeed, was
unknown to them, nor could they conjecture the bearer
of so ordinary a patronymic; but there had been secrets
enow in Lucretia's life to render her apprehensive of en-
countering those who had known her in earlier years; and
Warney feared lest any rumor reported to St. John might
create his mistrust, or lessen the hold obtained upon a vic-
tim heretofore so unsuspicious. They both agreed in the
expediency of withdrawing themselves and St. John, as
soon as possible, from London, and frustrating Percival's
chance of closer intercourse with the stranger, who had
evidently aroused his curiosity.
The next day Helen was much indisposed, and the symp-
toms grew so grave toward the evening that Madame Dali-
bard expressed alarm, and willingly suffered Percival (who

had only been permitted to see Helen for a few minutes,
when her lassitude was so extreme that she was obliged to
retire to her room) to go in search of a physician: he re-
turned with one of the most eminent of the faculty. On
the way to Brompton, in reply to the questions of Dr. y
Percival spoke of the dejection to which Helen was occa-
sionally subject, and this circumstance confirmed Dr. y
after he had seen the patient, in his view of the case. In
addition to some feverish and inflammatory symptoms,
which he trusted his prescriptions would speedily remove,
he found great nervous debility, and willingly fell in with
the casual suggestion of Warney, who was present, that a
change of air would greatly improve Miss Mainwaring's
general health, as soon as the temporary acute attack had
subsided. He did not regard the present complaint very
seriously, and reassured poor Percival by his cheerful mien
and sanguine predictions. Percival remained at the house
the whole day, and had the satisfaction, before he left, of
hearing that the remedies had already abated the fever,
and that Helen had fallen into a profound sleep. Walk-
ing back to town with Warney, the last said, hesitatingly,
“You were saying to me, the other day, that you feared
you should have to go, for a few days, both to Vernon
Grange and to Laughton, as your steward wished to point
out to you some extensive alterations in the management
of your woods, to commence this autumn. As you were
so soon coming of age, Lady Mary desired that her direc-
tions should yield to your own. Now, since Helen is
recommended change of air, why not invite Madame Dali-

bard to visit you at one of these places? I would suggest
Laughton. My poor mother-in-law, I know, longs to re-
visit the scene of her youth, and you could not compliment
or conciliate her more than by such an invitation.”
“Oh,” said Percival, joyfully, “it would realize the
fondest dream of my heart to see Helen under the old
roof-tree of Laughton; but as my mother is abroad, and
there is therefore no lady to receive them, perhaps 7)
“Why,” interrupted Warney, “Madame Dalibard her-
self is almost the very person whom les bienséances might
induce you to select to do the honors of your house in
Lady Mary's absence; not only as kinswoman to yourself,
but as the nearest surviving relative of Sir Miles—the
most immediate descendant of the St. Johns; her mature
years and decorum of life, her joint kindred to Helen
and yourself, surely remove every appearance of impro-
priety.”
“If she thinks so, certainly—I am no accurate judge of
such formalities. You could not oblige me more, Warney,
than in preobtaining her consent to the proposal. Helen
at Laughton l–Oh, blissful thought !”
“And in what air would she be so likely to revive?”
said Warney, but his voice was thick and husky.
The ideas thus presented to him, almost banished its
anxiety from Percival's breast. In a thousand delightful
shapes they haunted him during the sleepless night. And
when, the next morning, he found that Helen was sur-
prisingly better, he pressed his invitation upon Madame
Dalibard with a warmth that made her cheek yet more

pale, and the hand, which the boy grasped as he pleaded,
as cold as the dead. But she briefly consented, and Per-
cival, allowed a brief interview with Helen, had the rapture
to see her smile in a delight as childlike as his own at the
news he communicated, and listen, with swimming eyes,
when he dwelt on the walks they should take together,
amid haunts to become henceforth dear to her as to him-
self. Fairy-land dawned before them.
The visit of the physician justified Percival's heightened
spirits. All the acuter symptoms had vanished already.
He sanctioned his patient's departure from town as soon
as Madame Dalibard's convenience would permit, and
recommended only a course of restorative medicines to
strengthen the nervous system, which was to commence
with the following morning, and be persisted in for some
weeks. He dwelt much on the effect to be derived from
taking these medicines, the first thing in the day, as soon
as Helen woke. Warney and Madame Dalibard exchanged
a rapid glance. Charmed with the success that in this
instance had attended the skill of the great physician, Per-
cival, in his usual zealous benevolence, now eagerly pressed
upon Madame Dalibard the wisdom of consulting Dr.
for her own malady; and the doctor, putting on his specta-
cles, and drawing his chair nearer to the frowning cripple,
began to question her of her state; but Madame Dalibard
abruptly and discourteously put a stop to all interroga-
tories—she had already exhausted all remedies art could
suggest—she had become reconciled to her deplorable in-
firmity, and lost all faith in physicians,—some day or other

she might try the baths at Egra, but, till then, she must be
permitted to suffer undisturbed.
The doctor, by no means wishing to undertake a case
of chronic paralysis, rose smilingly, and with a liberal
confession that the German baths were sometimes ex-
tremely efficacious in such complaints, pressed Percival's
outstretched hand, then slipped his own into his pocket
and bowed his way out of the room.
Relieved from all apprehension, Percival very good-
humoredly received the hint of Madame Dalibard, that the
excitement through which she had gone for the last twenty-
four hours rendered her unfit for his society; and went
home to write to Laughton, and prepare all things for the
reception of his guests. Warney accompanied him. Per-
cival found Beck in the hall, already much altered, and
embellished by a new suit of livery. The ex-sweeper
stared hard at Warney, who, without recognizing, in so
smart a shape, the squalid tatterdemalion who had lighted
him up the stairs to Mr. Grabman's apartments, passed
him by into Percival's little study, on the ground floor.
“Well, Beck,” said Percival, ever mindful of others,
and attributing his groom's astonished gaze at Warney to
his admiration of that gentleman's showy exterior—“I
shall send you down to the country to-morrow with two
of the horses—so you may have to-day to yourself, to
take leave of your nurse. I flatter myself you will find
her rooms a little more comfortable than they were yes-
terday.”
Beck heard with a bursting heart; and his master,

giving him a cheering tap on the shoulder, left him tº
find his way into the streets, and to Becky's abode.
He found, indeed, that the last had already undergone
the magic transformation which is ever at the command
of godlike wealth. Mrs. Mivers, who was naturally prompt
and active, had had pleasure in executing Percival's com-
mission. Early in the morning, floors had been scrubbed
—the windows cleaned—the ventilator fixed;—then fol-
lowed porters with chairs and tables, and a wonderful
Dutch clock, and new bedding, and a bright piece of
carpet; and then came two servants belonging to Mrs.
Mivers to arrange the chattels; and finally, when all was
nearly completed, the Avatar of Mrs. Mivers herself, to
give the last finish with her own mittened hands, and in
her own housewifely apron.
The good lady was still employed in ranging a set of
tea-cups on the shelves of the dresser, when Beck entered;
and his old nurse, in the overflow of her gratitude, hob-
bled up to her foundling and threw her arms round his
neck.
“That's right!” said Mrs. Mivers, good humoredly,
turning round, and wiping the tear from her eye. “You
ought to make much of him, poor lad; he has turned out
a God-send, indeed; and, upon my word, he looks very
respectable in his new clothes. But what is this—a child's
coral?” as, opening a drawer in the dresser, she discovered
Beck's treasure. “Dear me, it is a very handsome one—
why, these bells look like gold !"—and, suspicion of her
protégé's honesty, for a moment, contracted her thoughtful

“Sure and sartin,” answered Becky, dropping her muti.
lated curtsy, “I be’s glad it be found now, instead of sum
days afore, or I might have been vicked enough to let it
go with the rest to the pop-shop; and I’m sure the time's

risted the timtashung, and said, ‘No, Becky Carruthers,

“Yes, yes, you told me all that before,” said Mrs.
Mivers, growing impatient, and already diverted from her
interest in the coral by a new cargo, all bright from the
tinman, which, indeed, no less instantaneously, absorbed
the admiration both of Beck and his nurse. And what
with the inspection of these articles, and the comments
each provoked, the coral rested in peace on the dresser,
till Mrs. Mivers, when just about to renew her inquiries,
was startled by the sound of the Dutch clock striking four,
a voice which reminded her of the lapse of time and her
own dinner hour. So, with many promises to call again,

and have a good chat with her humble friend, she took her
departure, amid the blessings of Becky, and the less noisy
but not less grateful salutations of Beck.
Very happy was the evening these poor creatures passed
together over their first cup of tea from the new bright
copper kettle, and the almost-forgotten luxury of crumpets,
in which their altered circumstances permitted them, with-
out extravagance, to indulge. In the course of conversa-
tion, Beck communicated how much he had been astonished
by recognizing the visitor of Grabman, the provoker of the
irritable grave-stealer, in the familiar companion. of his
master; and when Becky told him how often, in the do-
mestic experience her avocation of charing had accumu-
lated, she had heard of the ruin brought on rich young
men by gamblers and sharpers, Beck promised to himself
to keep a sharp eye on Grabman's showy acquaintance.
“For master is but a babe like,” said he, majestically;
“and I’d be cut into mincemeat afore I’d let an 'air on his
'ead come to 'arm, if so be's has 'ow I could perwent it.”
We need not say that his nurse confirmed him in these
good resolutions. -
“And now,” said Beck, when the time came for parting,
“you'll keep from the gin-shop, 'old 'oman, and not shame
the young master?”
“Sartin sure,” answered Becky; “it is only ven vun is
down in the world that vun goes to the licker-shop. Now,

Chuckling heartily at that vision, Beck kissed his nurse,
and trying hard to keep himself upright and do credit to
the dignity of his cloth, returned to his new room over the
stables.

was an image of inanimate prostration and decrepitude
that might have moved compassion to its depth. The
door opened, and Martha entered, to assist Madame Dali-
bard, as usual, to retire to rest. Her mistress slowly
raised her eyes at the noise of the opening door, and those
eyes took their searching, penetrating acuteness, as they
fixed upon the florid nor uncomely countenance of the
waiting-woman.
In her starched cap, her sober-colored stuff gown—in
her prim, quiet manner, and a certain sanctified demure-
ness of aspect, there was something in the first appear-
ance of this woman that impressed you with the notion
of respectability, and inspired confidence in those steady,
good qualities which we seek in a trusty servant. But,
more closely examined, an habitual observer might have
found much to qualify, perhaps to disturb his first prepos-
sessions. The exceeding lowness of the forehead, over
which that stiff, harsh hair was so puritanically parted—
the severe hardness of those thin, small lips, so pursed up
and constrained—even a certain dull cruelty in those light,
gold blue eyes, might have caused an uneasy sentiment,
almost approaching to fear. The fat grocer's spoiled child
instinctively recoiled from her, when she entered the shop
to make her household purchases—the old, gray-whiskered
terrier dog, at the public house, slunk into the tap when
she crossed the threshold.
Madame Dalibard silently suffered herself to be wheeled
into the adjoining bed-room, and the process of disrobing
was nearly completed before she said, abruptly:

“So you attended Mr. Warney's uncle in his last illness,
Did he suffer much 7”
“He was a poor creature at best,” answered Martha;
“but he gave me a deal of trouble afore he went. He
was a scranny corpse when I strecked him out.”
Madame Dalibard shrank from the hands at that mo-
ment employed upon herself, and said: -
“It was not, then, the first corpse you have laid out for
the grave?”
“Not by many.”
“And did any of those you so prepared die of the same
complaint”
“I can't say, I'm sure,” returned Martha. “I never
inquires how folks die; my bizness was to nurse 'em till
all was over, and then to sit up. As they say in my coun-
try—‘Riving Pike wears a hood, when the weather bodes
ill.’ ”
“And when you sat up with Mr. Warney's uncle, did you

“Young Mr. Warney said I should come to no harm,

“You have belonged to a very religious sect, I think I

Martha, without a change in her florid hue, which seemed
fixed in her cheek, as the red in an autumn leaf. “After

Dalibard was a bad sleeper, and often read in the night.
She then drew the curtains and went her way.

cripple rose—was on her feet—tall, elastic, erect It was
as a resuscitation from the grave. Never was change
more startling than that simple action effected—not in the
form alone, but the whole character of the face. The
solitary light streamed upward on a countenance on every
line of which spoke sinister power and strong resolve. If
you had ever seen her before, in her false, crippled state,
prostrate and helpless, and could have seen her then—
those eyes, if haggard still, now full of life and vigor—
that frame, if spare, towering aloft in commanding stature,
perfect in its proportions as a Grecian image of Nemesis
—your amaze would have merged into terror, so preter-
natural did the transformation appear l—so did aspect and
bearing contradict the very character of her sex; uniting
the two elements, most formidable in man or in fiend—
wickedness and powerl
She stood a moment motionless, breathing loud, as if it
were a joy to breathe free from restraint, and then, lifting
the light, and gliding to the adjoining room, she unlocked
a bureau in the corner, and bent over a small casket, which
she opened with a secret spring.

science of Hades numbers its murderous inventions. As
she searched for the ingredients her design had prese-
lected, something heavier than those small packets she
deranged fell to the bottom of the box with a low and
hollow sound. She started at the noise, and then smiled
in scorn of her momentary fear, as she took up the ring
that had occasioned the sound—a ring plain and solid, like
those used as signets in the Middle Ages, with a large dull
opal in the center. What secret could that bauble have
in common with its ghastly companions in Death's crypt?
This had been found among Olivier's papers; a note in
that precious manuscript, which had given to the hands of
his successors the keys of the grave, had discovered the
mystery of its uses. By the pressure of the hand, at the
touch of a concealed spring, a barbed point flew forth,
steeped in venom more deadly than the Indian extracts
from the bag of the cobra-capella, a venom to which no
antidote is known, which no test can detect. It corrupts
the whole mass of the blood—it mounts in frenzy and fire
to the brain—it rends the soul from the body in spasm and
convulsion. But examine the dead, and how divine the
effect of the cause 7–how go back to the records of the
Borgias, and amid all the skepticism of times in which,
happily, such arts are unknown, unsuspected, learn from

Borgia's device, was the master-piece in the science of Dali-
bard; a curious and philosophical triumph of research,
hitherto unused by its inventor and his heirs; for that
casket is rich in the choice of more gentle materials; but
the use yet may come. As she gazed on the ring, there
was a complacent and proud expression on Lucretia's face.
“Dumb token of Caesar Borgia 1" she murmured—“him
of the wisest head and the boldest hand that ever grasped
at empire;—whom Machiavel the virtuous rightly praised

falter in the paths which he trod with his royal step, only
because my goal is not a throne? Every circle is as com-

gloom in its hue, so stealthy and rapid in its movements,

you would, perforce, have deemed that your fancy had be-

RETROSPECT.
WE have now arrived at that stage in this history when
it is necessary to look back on the interval in Lucretia's
life—between the death of Dalibard, and her reintroduc-
tion, in the second portion of our tale.
One day, without previous notice or warning, Lucretia
arrived at William Mainwaring's house; she was in the
deep weeds of widowhood, and that garb of mourning suf-
ficed to add Susan's tenderest commiseration to the warmth
of her affectionate welcome. Lucretia appeared to have
forgiven the past, and to have conquered its more painful
recollections; she was gentle to Susan, though she rather
suffered than returned her caresses; she was open and
frank to William. Both felt inexpressibly grateful for her
visit—the forgiveness it betokened, and the confidence it
implied. At this time, no condition could be more promis-
ing and prosperous than that of the young banker. From
the first the most active partner in the bank, he had now
virtually almost monopolized the business. The senior
partner was old and infirm; the second had a bucolic turn,
and was much taken up by the care of a large farm he
had recently purchased, so that Mainwaring, more and
more trusted and honored, became the sole managing ad-

ministrator of the firm. Business throve in his able hands;
and with patient and steady perseverance there was little
doubt but what, before middle age was attained, his com-
petence would have swelled into a fortune sufficient to jus-
tify him in realizing the secret dream of his heart—the
parliamentary representation of the town in which he had
already secured the affection and esteem of the inhabitants.
It was not long before Lucretia detected the ambition
William's industry but partially concealed; it was not
long before, with the ascendancy natural to her will and
her talents, she began to exercise considerable, though
unconscious, influence over a man in whom a thousand
good qualities, and some great talents, were unhappily
accompanied by infirm purpose and weak resolutions. The
ordinary conversation of Lucretia unsettled his mind and
inflamed his vanity—a conversation able, aspiring, full both
of knowledge drawn from books, and of that experience of
public men, which her residence in Paris (whereon, with
its new and greater Charlemagne, the eyes of the world
were turned) had added to her acquisitions in the lore of
human life. Nothing more disturbs a mind like William
Mainwaring's than that species of eloquence which re-
bukes its patience in the present by inflaming all its hopes
in the future. Lucretia had none of the charming babble
of women—none of that tender interest in household de-
tails, in the minutiae of domestic life, which relaxes the
intellect while softening the heart. Hard and vigorous,
her sentences came forth in eternal appeal to the reason,
or address to the sterner passions in which love has no

share. Beside this strong thinker, poor Susan's sweet
talk seemed frivolous and inane. Her soft hold upon
Mainwaring loosened. He ceased to consult her upon
business—he began to repine that the partner of his lot
could have little sympathy with his dreams—more often
and more bitterly now did his discontented glance, in his
way homeward, rove to the roof-tops of the rural membel
for the town; more eagerly did he read the parliamentary
debates—more heavily did he sigh at the thought of elo-
quence denied a vent, and ambition delayed in its career.
When arrived at this state of mind, Lucretia's conversa-
tion took a more worldly, a more practical turn. Her
knowledge of the speculators of Paris instructed her pic-
tures of bold ingenuity creating sudden wealth; she spoke
of fortunes made in a day—of parvenus bursting into
millionaires—of wealth as the necessary instrument of
ambition, as the arch ruler of the civilized world. Never
once, be it observed, in these temptations, did Lucretia
address herself to the heart—the ordinary channels of
vulgar seduction were disdained by her; she would not
have stooped so low as Mainwaring's love, could she have
commanded or allured it; she was willing to leave to
Susan the husband reft from her own passionate youth,
but leave him with the brand on his brow and the worm at
his heart—a scoff and a wreck.
At this time there was, in that market-town, one of
those adventurous speculative men, who are the more
dangerous impostors because imposed upon by their own
sanguine chimeras, who have a plausibility in their calcu-

lations, an earnestness in their arguments, which account
for the dupes they daily make in our most sober and wary
of civilized communities. Unscrupulous in their means,
yet really honest in the belief that their objects can be at-
tained, they are at once the rogues and fanatics of Mam-
mon I This person was held to have been fortunate in
some adroit speculations in the corn trade, and he was
brought too frequently into business with Mainwaring not
to be a frequent visitor at the house. In him, Lucretia
saw the very instrument of her design; she led him on to
talk of business as a game—of money as a realizer of cent.
per cent.—she drew him into details—she praised him, she
admired. In his presence she seemed only to hear him—in
his absence, musingly, she started from silence to exclaim
on the acuteness of his genius and the accuracy of his
figures. Soon the tempter at Mainwaring's heart gave
signification to these praises—soon this adventurer became
his most intimate friend. Scarcely knowing why, never
ascribing the change to her sister, poor Susan wept,
amazed at Mainwaring's transformation—no care now for
the new books from London, or the roses in the garden l
—the music on the instrument was unheeded ! Books,
roses, music l—what are those trifles to a man thinking
upon cent. per cent.” Mainwaring's very countenance
altered—it lost its frank, affectionate beauty;-sullen, ab-
stracted, morose—it showed that some great care was at
the core. Then Lucretia herself began grievingly to notice
the change to Susan—gradually she altered her tone with
regard to the speculator, and hinted vague fears, and urged
16+

Susan to remonstrance and warning. As she anticipated,
warning and remonstrance came in vain to the man who,
comparing Lucretia's mental power to Susan's, had learned
to despise the unlearned timid sense of the last.
It is unnecessary to trace this change in Mainwaring,
step by step, or to measure the time which sufficed to
dazzle his reason and blind his honor. In the midst of
schemes and hopes, which the lust of gold now pervaded,
came a thunderbolt. An anonymous letter to the head
partner of the bank, provoked suspicions that led to mi-
nute examination of the accounts. It seemed that sums
had been irregularly advanced (upon bills drawn upon
men of straw) to the speculator by Mainwaring; and the
destination of these sums could be traced to gambling
operations in trade, in which Mainwaring had a private
interest and partnership. So great, as we have said, had
been the confidence placed in william's abilities and honor,
that the facilities afforded him, in the disposal of the joint
stock, far exceeded those usually granted to the partner of
a firm, and the breach of trust appeared the more flagrant
from the extent of the confidence misplaced. Meanwhile,
William Mainwaring, though as yet unconscious of the
proceedings of his partners, was gnawed by anxiety and
remorse, not unmixed with hope. He depended upon the
result of a bold speculation in the purchase of shares in a
Canal Company, a bill for which was then before parlia-
ment, with (as he was led to believe) a certainty of suc-
cess. The sums he had, on his own responsibility, ab-
stracted from the joint account were devoted to this

LU CRETIA. 187
adventure. But, to do him justice, he never dreamed of
appropriating the profits anticipated, to himself. Though
knowing that the bills on which the moneys had been ad-
vanced were merely nominal deposits, he had confidently
calculated on the certainty of success for the speculations
to which the proceeds so obtained were devoted, and he
looked forward to the moment when he might avow what
he had done, and justify it by doubling the capital with-
awn. But, to his inconceivable horror, the bill of the
-anal Company was rejected in the Lords—the shares
bought at a premium went down to zero; and, to add to
his perplexity, the speculator abruptly disappeared from
the town. In this crisis, he was summoned to meet his
indignant associates.
The evidence against him was morally damning, if not
legally conclusive. The unhappy man heard all in the
silence of despair. Crushed and bewildered, he attempted
no defense. He asked but an hour to sum up the losses
of the bank, and his own; they amounted within a few
hundreds to the ten thousand pounds he had brought to
the firm, and which, in the absence of marriage-settle-
ments, was entirely at his own disposal. This sum he at
once resigned to his associates, on condition that they
should defray from it his personal liabilities. The money
thus repaid, his partners naturally relinquished all further
inquiry. They were moved by pity for one so gifted and
so fallen—they even offered him a subordinate, but lucra-
ive, situation in the firm in which he had been partner:
"t Mainwaring wanted the patience and resolution to

work back the redemption of his name—perhaps, ulti-
mately, of his fortunes. In the fatal anguish of his shame
and despair, he fled from the town, his flight confirmed
forever the rumors against him—rumors worse than the
reality. It was long before he even admitted Susan to
the knowledge of the obseure refuge he had sought; there,
at length, she joined him. Meanwhile, what did Lucretia?
—she sold nearly half of her own fortune, constituted prin-
.ipally of the moiety of her portion, which, at Dalibard's
death, had passed to herself as survivor, and partly of the
share in her deceased husband's effects, which the French
law awarded to her; and with the proceeds of this sum
she purchased an annuity for her victims 1 Was this
strange generosity the act of mercy—the result of re-
pentance? No; it was one of the not least subtle and
delicious refinements of her revenge. To know him who
had rejected her—the rival who had supplanted—the mis-
erable pensioners of her bounty, was dear to her haughty
and disdainful hate. The lust of power, ever stronger in
her than avarice, more than reconciled her to the sacrifice
of gold;—yes, here, she, the despised, the degraded—had
power still;-her wrath had ruined the fortunes of her victim,
blasted the repute, embittered and desolated evermore the
future, now her contemptuous charity fed the wretched
lives that she spared in scorn. She had no small diffi-
culty, it is true, in persuading Susan to accept this sacri-
fice, and she did so only by sustaining her sister's belief
that the past yet could be retrieved—that Mainwaring's
energies could yet rebuild their fortunes, and that as the

LU CRETIA. 189
annuity was at any time redeemable, the aid therefore was
only temporary. With this understanding, Susan, over-
whelmed with gratitude, weeping, and broken hearted, de-
parted to join the choice of her youth. As the men,
deputed by the auctioneer to arrange and ticket the furni-
ture for sale, entered the desolate house, Lucretia then,
with the step of a conqueror, passed from the threshold.
“Ah!” she murmured as she paused, and gazed on the
walls—“ah, they were happy when I first entered those
doors l—happy in each other's tranquil love—happier
still, when they deemed I had forgiven the wrong and
abjured the past ! How honored was then their homel
How knew I then, for the first time, what the home of
love can be? And who had destroyed for me, upon all
the earth, a home like theirs?—they on whom that home
smiled with its serene and taunting peace l—I—I, the
abandoned l—the betrayed—what dark memories were on
my soul!—what a hell boiled within my bosom!—Well
might those memories take each a voice to accuse them 1–
well, from that hell, might rise the Alectol Their lives
were in my power!—my fatal dowry at my command—
rapid death, or slow consuming torture;—but to have
seen each cheer the other to the grave, lighting every
downward step with the eyes of love — vengeance, so
urged, would have fallen only on myself! Ha! deceiver,
didst thou plume thyself, forsooth, on spotless reputation?
—didst thou stand, me by thy side, among thy perjured
household gods, and talk of honor 7 Thy home—it is reft
from thee!—thy reputation, it is a scoff—thine honor, it

is a ghost that shall haunt thee! Thy love, can it linger
yet?–Shall the soft eyes of thy wife not burn into thy
heart, and shame turn love into loathing 7 Wrecks of my
vengeance—minions of my bounty—I did well to let ye
live I I shake the dust from my feet on your threshold;—
live on—homeless, hopeless, and childlessl The curse is
fulfilled !”
From that hour, Lucretia never paused from her career
to inquire further of her victims;–she never entered into
communication with either. They knew not her address,
nor her fate, nor she theirs. As she had reckoned, Main-
waring made no effort to recover himself from his fall.
All the high objects that had lured his ambition were
gone from him evermore. No place in the state, no au-
thority in the senate, awaits in England the man with a
blighted name. For the lesser objects of life, he had no
heart, and no care. They lived in obscurity in a small vil-
lage in Cornwall, till the peace allowed them to remove
to France. The rest of their fate is known.
Meanwhile, Lucretia removed to one of those smaller
Londons—resorts of pleasure and idleness, with which rich
England abounds, and in which widows of limited income
can make poverty seem less plebeian. And now, to all
those passions that had hitherto raged within her, a dismal
apathy succeeded. It was the great calm in her sea of life.
The winds fell, and the sails drooped. Her vengeance
satisfied, that, which she had made so preternaturally the
main object of existence, once fulfilled, left her in youth
objectless.

She strove at urst to take pleasure in the society of the
place, but its frivolities and pettiness of purpose soon
wearied that masculine and grasping mind, already made
insensible to the often healthful, often innocent, excite-
ment of trifles, by the terrible ordeal it had passed. Can
the touch of the hand, scorched by the burning iron, feel
pleasure in the softness of silk, or the light down of the
cygnet's plume 7. She next sought such relief as study
could afford; and her natural bent of thought, and her
desire to windicate her deeds to herself, plunged her into
the fathomless abyss of metaphysical inquiry, with the
hope to confirm into positive assurance her earlier skepti-
cism—with the atheist's hope, to annihilate the soul and
banish the presiding God. But no voice that could satisfy
her reason came from those dreary deeps: contradiction
on contradiction met her in the maze. Only when, wearied
with book-lore, she turned her eyes to the visible nature,
and beheld everywhere harmony, order, system, contriv-
ance, art, did she start with the amaze and awe of instinc-
tive conviction; and the natural religion revolted from her
cheerless ethics! Then came one of those sudden reac-
tions common with strong passions and exploring minds—
but more common with women, however manlike, than
with men. Had she lived in Italy then, she had become
a nun l For in this woman, unlike Warney and Dalibard,
the conscience could never be utterly silenced. In her
choice of evil, she found only torture to her spirit in all
the respites afforded to the occupations it indulged.
When employed upon ill, remorse gave way to the zest of

scheming; when the ill was done, remorse came with the
repose.
It was in this peculiar period of her life that Lucretia,
turning everywhere, and desperately, for escape from the
past, became acquainted with some members of one of the
most rigid of the sects of dissent. At first, she permitted
herself to know and commune with these persons from a
kind of contemptuous curiosity; she desired to encourage,
in contemplating them, her experience of the follies of hu-
man nature; but in that crisis of her mind, in those strug-
gles of her reason, whatever showed that which she yearned
most to discover, viz., earnest faith, rooted and genuine
conviction, whether of annihilation or of immortality—a
philosophy that might reconcile her to crime by destroy-
ing the providence of good, or a creed that could hold out
the hope of redeeming the past and exorcising sin by the
mystery of a Divine sacrifice,—had over her a power
which she had not imagined or divined. Gradually the
intense convictions of her new associates disturbed and
infected her. Their affirmations, that as we are born in
wrath, so sin is our second nature, our mysterious herit-
age, seemed, to her understanding, willing to be blinded,
to imply excuses for her past misdeeds. Their assurances
that the worst sinner may become the most earnest saint
—that through but one act of the will, resolute faith, all
redemption is to be found,-these affirmations and these
assurances, which have so often restored the guilty, and
remodeled the human heart, made a salutary, if brief, im-
pression upon her. Nor were the lives of these dissenters

(for the most part austerely moral), nor the peace and
self-complacency which they evidently found in the satis-
faction of conscience and fulfillment of duty, without an
influence over her, that, for awhile, both chastened and
soothed.
IIopeful of such a convert, the good teachers strove
hard to confirm the seeds springing up from the granite
and amid the weeds; and among them came one man more
eloquent, more seductive than the rest, Alfred Braddell.
This person, a trader at Liverpool, was one of those
strange living paradoxes that can rarely be found out of
a commercial community. He himself had been a con-
vert to the sect, and like most converts, he pushed his
enthusiasm into the bigotry of the zealot. He saw no
salvation out of the pale into which he had entered; but
though his belief was sincere, it did not genially operate
on his practical life; with the most scrupulous attention
to forms, he had the worldliness and cunning of the carnal.
He had abjured the vices of the softer senses, but not that
which so seldom wars on the decorums of outer life. He
was essentially a money-maker—close, acute, keen, over-
reaching. Good works with him were indeed as nothing
—faith, the all in all. He was one of the elect, and could
not fall. Still in this man there was all the intensity which
often characterizes a mind in proportion to the narrowness
of its compass; that intensity gave fire to his gloomy elo-
quence, and strength to his obstinate will. He saw Lu-
cretia, and his zeal for her conversion soon expanded into
love for her person, yet that love was secondary to his

covetousness. Though ostensibly in a flourishing busi-
ness, he was greatly distressed for money to carry on oper-
ations which swelled beyond the reach of his capital; his
fingers itched for the sum which Lucretia had still at her
disposal: but the seeming sincerity of the man, the per-
suasion of his goodness, his reputation for sanctity, deceived
her; she believed herself honestly and ardently beloved,
and by one who could guide her back, if not to happiness,
at least to repose. She herself loved him not, she could
love no more. But it seemed to her a luxury to find some
one she could trust, she could honor. If you had probed
into the recesses of her mind at that time, you would have
found that no religious belief was there settled—only the
desperate wish to believe—only the disturbance of all
previous infidelity—only a restless gnawing desire to es-
cape from memory, to emerge from the gulf. In this
troubled, impatient disorder of mind and feeling, she hur-
ried into a second marriage as fatal as the first.
For awhile she bore patiently all the privations of that
ascetic household; assisted in all those external formali-
ties; centered all her intellect within that iron range of
existence. But no grace descended on her soul—no warm
ray unlocked the ice of the well. Then, gradually becom-
ing aware of the niggardly meannesses, of the harsh, un-
charitable judgments, of the decorous frauds, that, with
unconscious hypocrisy, her husband concealed beneath the
robes of sanctity, a weary disgust stole over her; it stole,
it deepened, it increased;—it became intolerable, when she
discovered that Braddell had knowingly deceived her as to

his worldly substance. In that mood into which she had
rushed into these ominous nuptials, she had had no thought
for vulgar advantages; had Braddell been a beggar, she
had married him as rashly. But he, with the inability to
comprehend a nature like hers—dim not more to her ter-
rible vices than to the sinister grandeur which made their
ordinary atmosphere—had descended cunningly to address
the avarice he thought as potent in others as himself, to
enlarge on the worldly prosperity with which Providence
had blessed him; and now she saw that her dowry alone
had saved the crippled trader from the bankrupt list.
With this revolting discovery, with the scorn it produced,
vanished all Lucretia's unstable visions of reform. She
saw this man a saint among his tribe, and would not be-
lieve in the virtues of his brethren, great and unquestion-
able as they might have been proved to a more dispas-
sionate and humble inquirer. The imposture she detected,
she deemed universal in the circle in which she dwelt;
and Satan once more smiled upon the subject he regained.
Lucretia became a mother—but their child formed no en-
dearing tie between the ill-assorted pair; it rather embit-
tered their discord. Dimly, even then, as she bent over
the cradle, that vision which now, in the old house at
Brompton, haunted her dreams, and beckoned her over

ticeship, debased, not dignified, by the solemn mien, roused
her indignant wrath, she sickened when Braddell touched
her child. All her pride of intellect, that had never slept
—all her pride of birth, long dormant, woke up to protect
the heir of her ambition, the descendant of her race, from
the defilement of the father's nurture. Not long after her
confinement, she formed a plan for escape—she disappeared
from the house with her child. Taking refuge in a cot-
tage, living on the sale of the few jewels she possessed,
she was for some weeks almost happy. But Braddell,
less grieved by the loss than shocked by the scandal, was
indefatigable in his researches—he discovered her retreat.
The scene between them was terrible. There was no resist-
ing the power which all civilized laws give to the rights
of husband and father. Before this man, whom she scorned
so unutterably, Lucretia was impotent. Then, all the boil-
ing passions long suppressed beneath that command of
temper, which she owed both to habitual simulation and
intense disdain, rushed forth. Then, she appalled the im-
postor with her indignant denunciations of his hypocrisy,
his meanness, and his guile. Then, throwing off the mask
she had worn, she hurled her anathema on his sect, on his
faith, with the same breath that smote his conscience and
left it wordless. She shocked all the notions he sincerely
entertained, and he stood awed by accusations from a

blasphemer whom he dared not rebuke. His rage broke
at length from his awe. Stung, maddened by the scorn
of himself, his blood fired into juster indignation by her
scoff at his creed, he lost all self-possession, and struck
her to the ground. In the midst of shame and dread at
disclosure of his violence, which succeeded the act so pro-
voked, he was not less relieved than amazed when Lucre-
tia, rising slowly, laid her hand gently on his arm, and
said, “Repent not, it is past; fear not, I will be silent 1
Come, you are the stronger—you prevail. I will follow
my child to your home.”
In this unexpected submission in one so imperious,
Braddell's imperfect comprehension of character saw but
fear, and his stupidity exulted in his triumph. Lucretia
returned with him. A few days afterward, Braddell be-
came ill; the illness increased,—slow, gradual, wearing.
It broke his spirit with his health; and then the steadfast
imperiousness of Lucretia's stern will ruled and subju-
gated him. He cowered beneath her haughty, searching
gaze, he shivered at her sidelong, malignant glance; but
with this fear came necessarily hate; and this hate, some-
times sufficing to vanquish the fear, spitefully evinced itself
in thwarting her legitimate control over her infant. He
would have it (though he had little real love for chil-
dren) constantly with him, and affected to contradict all
her own orders to the servants, in the sphere in which
mothers arrogate most the right. Only on these occasions
sometimes would Lucretia lose her grim self-control, and
threaten that her child yet should be emancipated from his

hands, – should yet be taught the scorn for hypocrites,
which he had taught herself These words sank deep not
only in the resentment, but in the conscience of the hus-
band. Meanwhile, Lucretia scrupled not to evince her
disdain of Braddell, by markedly abstaining from all the
ceremonies she had before so rigidly observed. The sect
grew scandalized. Braddell did not abstain from making
known his causes of complaint. The haughty, imperious
woman was condemned in the community, and hated in the
household.
It was at this time that Walter Ardworth, who was then
striving to eke out his means by political lectures (which
at the earlier part of the century found ready audience) in
our great towns, came to Liverpool. Braddell and Ard-
worth had been school-fellows, and even at school, embryo
politicians of congenial notions; and the conversion of
the former to one of the sects which had grown out of the
old creeds that, under Cromwell, had broken the scepter
of the son of Belial, and established the Commonwealth
of Saints, had only strengthened the republican tenets of
the sour fanatic. Ardworth called on Braddell, and was
startled to find in his school-fellow's wife the niece of his
benefactor, Sir Miles St. John. Now, Lucretia had never
divulged her true parentage to her husband. In a union
so much beneath her birth, she had desired to conceal from
all her connections the fall of the once-honored heiress.
She had descended, in search of peace, to obscurity; but
her pride revolted from the thought, that her low-born
husband might boast of her connections, and parade her

descent to his level. Fortunately, as she thought, she re-
ceived Ardworth before he was admitted to her husband,
who now, growing feebler and feebler, usually kept his
room. She stooped to beseech Ardworth not to reveal
her secret, and he, comprehending her pride, as a man
well born himself, and pitying her pain, readily gave his
promise. At the first interview, Braddell evinced no
pleasure in the sight of his old school-fellow. It was
natural enough that one so precise should be somewhat
revolted by one so careless of all form. But when Lu-
cretia imprudently evinced satisfaction at his surly remarks
on his visitor—when he perceived that it would please her
that he should not cultivate the acquaintance offered him,
he was moved by the spirit of contradiction, and the spite-
ful delight even in frivolous annoyance to conciliate and
court the intimacy he had at first disdained; and then, by
degrees, sympathy in political matters, and old recollec-
tions of sportive, careless boyhood, cemented the intimacy
into a more familiar bond than the sectarian had contracted
really with any of his late associates.
Lucretia regarded this growing friendship with great
uneasiness—the uneasiness increased to alarm, when one
day, in the presence of Ardworth, Braddell, writhing with
a sudden spasm, said—“I cannot account for these strange
seizures—I think verily I am poisoned I"—and his dull
eye rested on Lucretia's pallid brow. She was unusually
thoughtful for some days after this remark, and one morn-
ing she informed her husband that she had received the
intelligence that a relation, from whom she had pecuniary

expectations, was dangerously ill, and requested his per-
mission to visit this sick kinsman, who dwelt in a distant
county. Braddell's eyes brightened at the thought of her
absence; with little further questioning he consented;
and Lucretia, sure perhaps that the barb was in the side
of her victim, and reckoning, it may be, on greater free-
dom from suspicion if her husband died in her absence,
left the house. It was, indeed, to the neighborhood of her
kindred that she went. In a private conversation with
Ardworth, when questioning him of his news of the pres-
ent possessor of Laughton, he had informed her that he
had heard accidentally that Vernon's two sons (Percival
was not then born) were sickly; and she went into Hamp-
shire, secretly and unknown, to see what were really the
chances that her son might yet become the lord of her lost
inheritance.
During this absence, Braddell, now gloomily aware that
his days were numbered, resolved to put into practice the
idea long contemplated, and even less favored by his spite
than justified by the genuine convictions of his conscience.
Whatever his faults, sincere at least in his religious belief,
he might well look with dread to the prospect of the train-
ing and education his son would receive from the hands of
a mother who had blasphemed his sect, and openly pro-
claimed her infidelity. By will, it is true, he might create
a trust, and appoint guardians to his child. But to have
lived under the same roof with his wife—nay, to have car-
ried her back to that roof when she had left it, afforded
tacit evidence that whatever the disagreement between

them, her conduct could hardly have merited her exclusion
from the privileges of a mother. The guardianship might
therefore avail little to frustrate Lucretia's indirect con-
tamination, if not her positive control. Besides, where
guardians are appointed money must be left; and Brad-
dell knew that at his death his assets would be found in-
sufficient for his debts. Who would be guardian to a
penniless infant? He resolved, therefore, to send his child
from his roof, to some place where, if reared humbly, it
might at least be brought up in the right faith—some place
which might defy the search and be beyond the perversion
of the unbelieving mother. He looked round, and dis-
covered no instrument for this purpose that seemed so
ready as Walter Ardworth. For by this time he had
thoroughly excited the pity and touched the heart of that
good-natured, easy man. His representations of the mis-
conduct of Lucretia were the more implicitly believed by
one who had always been secretly prepossessed against
her—who, admitted to household intimacy, was an eye-
witness to her hard indifference to her husband's sufferings
—who saw in her very request not to betray her gentle
birth, the shame she felt in her election—who regarded
with indignation her unfeeling desertion of Braddell in
his last moments, and who, besides all this, had some pri-
vate misfortunes of his own, which made him the more
ready listener to themes on the faults of women, and had
already, by mutual confidences, opened the hearts of the
two ancient school-fellows to each other's complaints and
wrongs. The only other confidante in the refuge selected

for the child was a member of the same community as
Braddell, who kindly undertook to search foºa pious,
godly woman, who, upon such pecuniary considerations
as Braddell, by robbing his creditors, could afford to be-
stow, would permanently offer to the poor infant a mother's
home and a mother's care. When this woman was found,
Braddell confided his child to Ardworth, with such a sum
as he could scrape together for its future maintenance.
And to Ardworth, rather than to his fellow-sectarian, this
double trust was given, because the latter feared scandal
and misrepresentation, if he should be ostensibly mixed up
in so equivocal a charge. Poor and embarrassed as Wal-
ter Ardworth was, Braddell did not for once misinterpret
character when he placed the money in his hands, and this
because the characters we have known in transparent boy-
hood we have known forever. Ardworth was reckless
and his whole life had been wrecked—his whole nature
materially degraded—by the want of common thrift and
prudence. His own money slipped through his fingers
and left him surrounded by creditors, whom, rigidly speak-
ing, he thus defrauded; but direct dishonesty was as wholly
out of the chapter of his vices as if he had been a man of
the strictest principles and the steadiest honor.
The child was gone—the father died—Lucretia re-
turned, as we have seen in Grabman's letter, to the house
of death, to meet suspicion and cold looks, and menial
accusations, and an inquest on the dead: but through all
this the reſt tigress mourned her stolen whelp. As soon
as all evidence against her was proved legally groundless,

and she had leave to depart, she searched blindly and
frantically for her lost child; but in vain. The utter and
penniless destitution in which she was left by her husband's
decease did not suffice to terminate her maddening chase.
On foot she wandered from village to village, and begged
her way, wherever a false clew misled her steps.
At last, in reluctant despair, she resigned the pursuit,
and found herself one day in the midst of the streets of
London, half famished and in rags; and before her sud-
denly, now grown into vigorous youth—blooming, sleek,
and seemingly prosperous—stood Gabriel Warney. By
her voice, as she approached and spoke, he recognized his
step-mother; and, after a short pause of hesitation, he led
her to his home. It is not our purpose (for it is not
necessary to those passages of their lives from which we
have selected the thread of our tale) to follow these two,
thus united, through their general career of spoliation and
crime. Birds of prey, they searched in human follies and
human errors for their food : sometimes severed, some-
times together, their interests remained one. Warney pro-
fited by the mightier and subtler genius of evil to which he
had lashed himself; for, caring little for luxuries, and dead
to the softer senses, she abandoned to him readily the
larger share of their plunder. Under a variety of names
and disguises, through a succession of frauds, some vast and
some mean, but chiefly on the Continent, they had pur-
sued their course, eluding all danger and baffling all law.
Between three and four years before this period, Warney's
uncle, the painter, by one of those unexpected caprices of

fortune which sometimes find heirs to a millionaire at the
weaver's loom or the laborer's plow, had suddenly, by the
death of a very distant kinsman, whom he had never seen,
come into possession of a small estate, which he sold for
6000l. Retiring from his profession, he lived, as com-
fortably as his shattered constitution permitted, upon the
interest of this sum; and he wrote to his nephew, then at
Paris, to communicate the good news, and offer the hospi-
tality of his hearth. Warney hastened to London. Shortly
afterward a nurse, recommended as an experienced, useful
person in her profession, by Nicholas Grabman, who, in
many a tortuous scheme, had been Gabriel's confederate,
was installed in the poor painter's house. From that time
his infirmities increased. He died, as his doctor said, “by
abstaining from the stimulants to which his constitution
had been so long accustomed;” and Gabriel Warney was
summoned to the reading of the will. To his inconceiva.
ble disappointment, instead of bequeathing to his nephew
the free disposal of his 6000l., that sum was assigned to
trustees for the benefit of Gabriel and his children yet un-
born: “An inducement,” said the poor testator, tenderly.
“for the boy to marry and reform 1" So that the nephew
could only enjoy the interest, and had no control over the
capital. The interest of 6000l. invested in the Bank of
England, was flocci, nauci to the voluptuous spendthrift,
Gabriel Warney!
Now, these trustees were selected from the painter's
earlier and more respectable associates, who had dropped
him, it is true, in his days of beggary and disrepute, but

whom the fortune that made him respectable had again
conciliated. One of these trustees had lately retired to
pass the remainder of his days at Boulogne;—the other
was a hypochondriacal valetudinarian. Neither of them,
in short, a man of business. Gabriel was left to draw out
the interest of the money, as it became periodically due, at
the Bank of England. In a few months, the trustee set-
tled at Boulogne died—the trust of course lapsed to Mr.
Stubmore, the valetudinarian survivor. Soon pinched by
extravagances, and emboldened by the character and help-
less state of the surviving trustee, Warney forged Mr. Stub-
more's signature to an order on the bank to sell on such
portion of the capital as his wants required. The impunity
of one offense begot courage for others, till the whole was
well-nigh expended. Upon these sums Warney had lived
very pleasantly, and he saw with a deep sigh the approach-
ing failure of so facile a resource.
In one of the melancholy moods engendered by this
reflection, Warney happened to be in the very town in
France in which the Mainwarings, in their later years,
had taken refuge, and from which Helen had been re-
moved to the roof of Mr. Fielden. By accident he heard
the name, and, his curiosity leading to further inquiries,
learned that Helen was made an heiress by the will of her
grandfather. With this knowledge came a thought of the
most treacherous, the most miscreant and the vilest crime,
that even he yet had perpetrated; so black was it, that
for awhile he absolutely struggled against it. But in guilt
there seems ever a Necessity that urges on step after step

—to the last consummation. Warney received a letter to
inform him that the last surviving trustee was no more, that
the trust was, therefore, now centered in his son and heir,
that that gentleman was at present very busy in settling
his own affairs, and examining into a very mismanaged
property in Devonshire, which had devolved upon him;
but that he hoped in a few months to discharge more effi-
ciently, than his father had done, the duties of trustee, and
that some more profitable investment than the Bank of
England would probably occur.
This new trustee was known personally to Warney—a
contemporary of his own, and, in earlier youth, a pupil to
his uncle. But, since then, he had made way in life, and
retired from the Profession of Art. This younger Stub-
more he knew to be a bustling, officious man of business
—somewhat greedy and covetous, but withal somewhat
weak of purpose, good natured in the main, and with a
little lukewarm kindness for Gabriel, as a quondam fellow-
pupil. That Stubmore would discover the fraud was evident
—that he would declare it, for his own sake, was evident
also-that the bank would prosecute—that Warney would
be convicted, was no less surely to be apprehended. There
was only one chance left to the forger—if he could get into
his hands, and in time, before Stubmore's bustling interfer-
ence, a sum sufficient to replace what had been fraudulently
taken—he might easily manage, he thought, to prevent the
forgery ever becoming known. Nay, if Stubmore, roused
into strict personal investigation, by the new Power of At-

necessary, should ascertain what had occurred, his liabili-
ties being now indemnified, and the money replaced, War-
ney thought he could confidently rely on his ci-devant
fellow-pupil's assent to wink at the forgery and hush up
the matter. But this was his only chance. How was the
money to be gained 7 He thought of Helen's fortune,
and the last scruple gave way to the imminence of his
peril and the urgency of his fears.
With this decision, he repaired to Lucretia, whose con-
currence was necessary to his designs. Long habits of
crime had now deepened still more the dark and stern
color of that dread woman's somber nature. But through
all that had ground the humanity from her soul, one hu-
man sentiment, fearfully tainted and adulterated as it was,
still struggled for life—the memory of the mother. It was
by this, her least criminal emotion, that Warney led her to
the worst of her crimes. He offered to sell out the re-
mainder of the trust-money by a fresh act of forgery—to
devote such proceeds to the search for her lost Vincent;
he revived the hopes she had long since gloomily relin-
quished, till she began to conceive the discovery easy and
certain. He then brought before her the prospect of that
son's succession to Laughton—but two lives now between
him and those broad lands—those two lives, associated
with just cause of revenge!—two lives! Lucretia, till then,
did not know that Susan had left a child—that a pledge of
those nuptials, to which she imputed all her infamy, ex-
isted to revive a jealousy never extinguished, appeal to the
hate that had grown out of her love. More readily than

Warney had anticipated, and with fierce exultation, she fell
into his horrible schemes. -
Thus had she returned to England, and claimed the
guardianship of her niece. Warney engaged a dull house
in the suburb, and looking out for a servant not likely to
suspect and betray, found the nurse who had watched over
his uncle's last illness; but Lucretia, according to her in-
variable practice, rejected all menial accomplices—reposed
no confidence in the tools of her black deeds. Feigning
an infirmity that would mock all suspicion of the hand that
mixed the draught, and the step that stole to the slumber,
she defied the justice of earth, and stood alone under the
omniscience of heaven.
Various considerations had delayed the execution of the
atrocious deed so coldly contemplated. Lucretia herself
drew back; perhaps more daunted by conscience than she
herself was distinctly aware, and disguising her scruples
in those yet fouler refinements of hoped revenge which her
conversations with Warney have betrayed to the reader
The failure of the earlier researches for the lost Vincent,
the suspended activity of Stubmore, left the more impa-
tient murderer leisure to make the acquaintance of St. John,
steal into the confidence of Helen, and render the insur-
ances on the life of the latter less open to suspicion than
if effected immediately on her entrance into that shamble-
house, and before she could be supposed to form that affec-
tion for her aunt which made probable so tender a fore-
thought. These causes of delay now vanished, the Parcae
closed the abrupt woof, and lifted the impending shears.

Lucretia had long since dropped the name of Braddell.
She shrank from proclaiming those second spousals, sullied
by the degradation to which they had exposed her, and
the suspicions implied on the inquest on her husband, until
the hour for acknowledging her son should arrive. She
resumed, therefore, the name of Dalibard, and by that we
will continue to call her. Nor was Warney uninfluential
in dissuading her from proclaiming her second marriage
till occasion necessitated. If the son were discovered, and
the proofs of his birth in the keeping of himself and his
accomplice, his avarice naturally suggested the expediency
of wringing from that son some pledge of adequate reward
on succession to an inheritance which they alone could
secure to him: out of this fancied fund, not only Grab-
man, but his employer, was to be paid. The concealment
of the identity between Mrs. Braddell and Madame Dali-
bard might facilitate such an arrangement. This idea
Warney locked as yet in his own breast. did not dare
to speak to Lucretia of the bargain he ultimately meditated
with her son.

MR. GRABMAN's ADVENTURES.
THE lackeys in their dress-liveries stood at the porch of
Laughton, as the postilions drove rapidly along the road,
sweeping through venerable groves tinged with the hues
of autumn, up to that stately pile. From the window of
the large cumbrous vehicle, which Percival, mindful of
Madame Dalibard's infirmity, had hired for her special ac-
commodation, Lucretia looked keenly forth. On the slope
of the hill grouped the deer, and below, where the lake
gleamed, the swan rested on the wave. Farther on to the
left, gaunt and stag-headed, rose, living still, from the
depth of theºlen, Guy's memorable oak. Coming now
in sight, though at a distance, the gray church tower
emerged from the surrounding masses of solemn foliage.
Suddenly, the road curves round, and straight before her
(the rooks cawing above the turrets, the sun reflected from
the vanes) Lucretia gazes on the halls of Laughton. And
didst thou not, oh Guy's oak, murmur warning from thine
oracular hollows 7 And thou, who sleepest below the

grave, when, with such tender care, the young Lord of

with credulous, moistened eyes, welcomed Treason and
Murder to his hearth? *
There, at the porch, paused Helen, gazing with the rapt
eye of the poetess on the broad landscape, checkered by
the vast shadows cast from the setting sun. There, too,
by her side, lingered Warney, with an artist's eye for the
stately scene, till a thought, not of art, changed the face of
the earth, and the view without mirrored back the Gol-
gotha of his soul.
Leave them thus—we must hurry on.
One day a traveler stopped his gig at a public house in
a village in Lancashire. He chucked the rein to the ostler,
and in reply to a question what oats should be given to
the horse, said—“Hay and water—the beast is on job.”
Then sauntering to the bar, he called for a glass of raw
brandy for himself; and while the host drew the spirit
forth from the tap, he asked, carelessly, if, some years ago,
a woman of the name of Joplin had not resided in the
village.
“It is strange,” said the host, musingly.
“What is strange?”
“Why, we have just had a gent, asking the same ques-
tion. I have only been here nine year come December,
but my old ostler was born in the village, and never left
it. So the gent had in the ostler, and he is now gone
into the village to pick up what else he can learn.”
This intelligence seemed to surprise and displease the
traveler. “What the deuce,” he muttered, “does Jason
mistrust me? Has he set another dog on the scent?

Humph!” He drained off his brandy, and sallied forth to
confer with the ostler.
“Well, my friend,” said Mr. Grabman, for the traveler
was no other than that worthy—“well, so you remember
Mrs. Joplin, more than twenty years ago—eh 7"
“Yees, I guess; more than twenty years since she left
the Pleck.”
“Ah! she seems to have been a restless body—she had
a child with her ?”
“Yees, I moind that.”
“And I dare say you heard her say the child was not
her own, that she was paid well for it, eh?”
“Noa; my missus did not loike me to chaffer much
with neighbor Joplin, for she was but a bad 'un—pretty
fease, too. She lived agin the woght yonder, where you
see that gent coming out.”
“Oho! that is the gent who was asking after Mrs. Jop-
lin 7”
“Yees; and he giv' me half a croon!” said the clever
ostler, holding out his hand.
Mr. Grabman, too thoughtful, too jealous of his rival,
to take the hint at that moment, darted off, as fast as his
thin legs could carry him, toward the unwelcome interferer
in his own business.
Approaching the gentleman—a tall, powerful-looking
young man—he somewhat softened his tone, and mechan-
ically touched his hat as he said:

“What, sir, are you, too, in search of Mrs. Joplin?”
“Sir, I am,” answered the young man, eyeing Grabman
deliberately, “and you, I suppose, are the person I have
found before me on the same search,-first, at Liverpool;
next, at C , about fifteen miles from that town; thirdly,
at L–; and now we meet here. You have had the
start of me. What have you learned 7”
Mr. Grabman smiled: “Softly, sir, softly. May I first
ask (since open questioning seems the order of the day)
whether I have the honor to address a brother practitioner
—one of the law, sir—one of the law 7”
“I am one of the law.”
Mr. Grabman bowed and scowled.
“And may I make bold to ask the name of your client?”
“Certainly, you may ask. Every man has a right to
ask what he pleases, in a civil way.”
“But you'll not answer? Deep ! Oh, I understand 1
Very good. But I am deep too, sir. You know Mr.
Warney, I suppose?”
The gentleman looked surprised. His bushy brows met
over his steady, sagacious eyes; but after a moment's
pause, the expression of the face cleared up.
“It is as I thought,” he said half to himself. “Who
else could have had an interest in similar inquiries? Sir,”
he added, with a quick and decided tone, “you are, doubt-
less, employed by Mr. Warney on behalf of Madame Dali-
bard, and in search of evidence connected with the loss
of an unhappy infant. I am on the same quest and for
the same end. The interests of your client are mine.

Two heads are better than one; let us unite our ingenuity
and endeavors.”
“And share the pec, I suppose?” said Grabman, dryly,
buttoning up his pockets.
“Whatever fee you may expect, you will have anyhow,
whether I assist you or not. I expect no fee—for mine is
a personal interest, which I serve gratuitously; but I can
undertake to promise you, on my own part, more than the
ordinary professional reward for your co-operation.”
“Well, sir,” said Grabman, mollified, “you speak very
much like a gentleman. My feelings were hurt at first, I
own. I am hasty, but I can listen to reason. Will you
walk back with me to the house you have just left? and
suppose we then turn in and have a chop together, and
compare notes.”
“Willingly!” answered the tall stranger, and the two
inquisitors amicably joined company. The result of their
inquiries was not, however, very satisfactory. No one
knew whither Mrs. Joplin had gone, though all agreed it
was in company with a man of bad character and vagrant
habits—all agreed, too, in the vague recollection of the
child, and some remembered that it was dressed in clothes
finer than would have been natural to an infant legally

at the previous places of their research, they found an en-
tire agreement as to the character personally borne by
Mrs. Joplin. At the village to which their inquiry had
been first directed, she was known as a respectable, pre-
cise young woman, one of a small congregation of rigid
dissenters. She had married a member of the sect, and
borne him a child, which died two weeks after birth. She
was then seen nursing another infant—though how she
came by it, none knew. Shortly after this, her husband, a
journeyman carpenter of good repute, died; but to the
surprise of the neighbors, Mrs. Joplin continued to live
as comfortably as before, and seemed not to miss the wages
of her husband; nay, she rather now, as if before kept
back by the prudence of the deceased, launched into a less
thrifty mode of life, and a gayety of dress at variance both
with the mourning her recent loss should have imposed,
and the austere tenets of her sect. This indecorum ex-
cited angry curiosity, and drew down stern remonstrance.
Mrs. Joplin, in apparent disgust at this intermeddling with
her affairs, withdrew from the village to a small town,
about twenty miles distant, and there set up a shop. But
her moral lapse became now confirmed; her life was noto-
riously abandoned, and her house the resort of all the
reprobates of the place. Whether her means began to be
exhausted, or the scandal she provoked attracted the notice
of the magistrates and imposed a check on her course,
was not very certain, but she sold off her goods suddenly,
and was next tracked to the village in which Mr. Grabman
met his new coadjutor; and there, though her conduct was

less flagrant and her expenses less reckless, she made but a
very unfavorable impression, which was confirmed by her
flight with an itinerant hawker of the lowest possible char-
acter. Seated over their port wine, the two gentlemen
compared their experiences, and consulted on the best
mode of remending the broken thread of their research;
when Mr. Grabman said, coolly, “But, after all, I think it
most likely that we are not on the right scent. This bant-
ling may not be the one we search for.” -
“Be not misled by that doubt. To arrive at the evi-
dence we desire, we must still track this wretched woman.”
“You are certain of that ?”
“Certain.”
“Hem 1 Did you ever hear of a Mr. Walter Ard-
worth 7”
“Yes; what of him 7”
“Why, he can best tell us where to look for the child.”
“I am sure he would counsel as I do.”
“You know him, then?”
“I do.”
“What!—he lives still ?”
“I hope so.”
“Can you bring me across him 7”
“If necessary.”
“And that young man, who goes by his name, brought
up by Mr. Fielden ?”
“Well, sir?”
“Is he not the son of Mr. Braddell ?”
The stranger was silent, and, shading his face with his

hand, seemed buried in thought. He then rose, took up
his candle, and said quietly:
“Sir, I wish you good evening. I have letters to write
in my own room. I will consider by to-morrow, if you
stay till then, whether we can really aid each other further,
or whether we should pursue our researches separately.”
With these words, he closed the door; and Mr. Grabman
remained baffled and bewildered.
However, he too had a letter to write; so, calling for
pen, ink, and paper, and a pint of brandy, he indited his
complaints and his news to Warney:
“Jason,” he began, “are you playing me false 7 Have
you set another man on the track with a view to bilk me
of my promised fee 2–Explain, or I throw up the busi-
ness.”
Herewith, Mr. Grabman gave a minute description of
the stranger, and related pretty accurately what had passed
between that gentleman and himself. He then added the
progress of his own inquiries, and renewed, as peremptorily
as he dared, his demand for candor and plain dealing.
Now, it so happened that, in stumbling up stairs to bed,
Mr. Grabman passed the room in which his mysterious
fellow-seeker was lodged, and, as is the usage in hostels, a
pair of boots stood outside the door, to be cleaned betimes
in the morning. Though somewhat drunk, Grabman still
preserved the rays of his habitual astuteness. A clever,
and a natural idea, shot across his brain, illuminating the
fumes of the brandy; he stooped, and while one hand on

the wall steadied his footing, with the other he fished up
a boot, and peering within, saw legibly written—“John
Ardworth, Esq., Gray's Inn.” At that sight, he felt what
a philosopher feels at the sudden elucidation of a trouble- -
some problem. Down stairs again tottered Grabman, re-
opened his letter, and wrote: “P. S.—I have wronged
you, Jason, by my suspicions; never mind – Jubilate/
This interloper, who made me so jealous—who, think you,
it is 7 Why, young Ardworth himself—that is, the lad
who goes by such name. Now, is it not clear 7—of course,
no one else has such interest in learning his birth as the
lost child himself—Here he is 1 If old Ardworth lives (as
he says), old Ardworth has set him to work on his own
business. But then, that Fielden—rather a puzzler that!
Yet, no;-now I understand—old Ardworth gave the boy
to Mrs. Joplin, and took it away from her again when he
went to the parson's. Now, certainly, it may be quite
necessary to prove—first, that the boy he took from Mr.
Braddell's he gave to Mrs. Joplin; secondly, that the boy
he left with Mr. Fielden was the same that he took again
from that woman—therefore the necessity of finding out
Mother Joplin, an essential witness: Q. E. D., Master
Jason l’”
It was not till the sun had been some hours risen that
Mr. Grabman imitated that luminary's example. When
he did so, he found, somewhat to his chagrin, that John
Ardworth had long been gone. In fact, whatever the
motive that had led the latter on the search, he had suc-
ceeded in gleaning from Grabman all that that person

could communicate, and their interview had inspired him
with such disgust of the attorney, and so small an opinion
of the value of his co-operation (in which last belief, per-
haps, he was mistaken), that he had resolved to continue
his inquiries alone, and had already, in his early morning's
walk through the village, ascertained that the man with
whom Mrs. Joplin had quitted the place had some time
after been sentenced to six months' imprisonment in the
county jail. Possibly the prison authorities might know
something to lead to his discovery; and through him the
"iews of his paramour might be gained.

ONE day, at the hour of noon, the court boasting the tall
r idence of Mr. Grabman was startled from the quiet
usually reigning there at broad daylight, by the appear-
ance of two men, evidently no inhabitants of the place.
The squalid, ill-favored denizens lounging before the doors,
stared hard; and, at the fuller view of one of the men,
most of them retreated hastily within. Then, in those
houses, you might have heard a murmur of consternation
and alarm. The ferret was in the burrow—a Bow Street
officer in the court. The two men paused, looked round,
and, stopping before the dingy tower-like house, selected
the bell which appealed to the inmates of the ground floor,
to the left. At that summons Bill the cracksman impru-
dently presented a full view of his countenance through
his barred window; he drew it back with astonishing
celerity; but not in time to escape the eye of the Bow
Street runner.
“Open the door, Bill—there's nothing to fear—I have
no summons against you, 'pon honor. You know I never
deceive. Why should I? Open the door, I say!”
No answer.
The officer tapped with his cane at the foul window.

“Bill! there's a gentleman who comes to you for in-
formation, and he will pay for it handsomely.”
Bill again appeared at the casement, and peeped forth,
very cautiously, through the bars.
“Bless my vitals, Mr. R.—l and it is you, is it?
What were you saying about ‘paying handsomely'?”
“That your evidence is wanted—not against a pal, man.
It will hurt no one, and put at least five guineas in your
pocket.”
“Ten guineas 1” said the Bow Street officer's com-
panion.
“You be's a man of 'onor, Mr. R–!” said Bill, em-
phatically; “and I scorns to doubt you—so here goes.”
With that, he withdrew from the window, and in another
minute or so the door was opened, and Bill, with a superb
bow, asked his visitors into his room.
In the interval, leisure had been given to the cracksman
to remove all trace of the wonted educational employment
of his hopeful children. The urchins were seated on the
floor, playing at push-pin; and the Bow Street officer
benignly patted a pair of curly heads as he passed them,
drew a chair to the table, and, wiping his forehead, sat
down, quite at home. Bill then deliberately seated him-
self, and, unbuttoning his waistcoat, permitted the butt-
ends of a brace of pistols to be seen by his guests. Mr.
R.'s companion seemed very unmoved by this significant
action. He bent one inquiring steady look on the cracks-
man, which, as Bill afterward said, went through him

through the network of which the sovereigns gleamed
pleasantly, placed it on the table, and said:
“This purse is yours, if you will tell me what has be-
come of a woman named Joplin, with whom you left the
village of —, in Lancashire, in the year 18–.”
“And,” put in Mr. R. , “the gentleman wants to
know, with no view of harming the woman. It will be to
her own advantage to inform us where she is.”
“'Pon honor, again?” said Bill.
“'Pon honorſ”

“Why not, indeed?” said Mr. R-. “And as we
want to learn not only what has become of Mrs. Joplin,

Bill mused.
“How much is there in the pus?”

says Peg, “they left it too long for that, and all the tin

Mr. R– smiled significantly.
Bill resumed. “Where was I? Oh, when my wife died,

Peg into the 'ous. But Lor! how she larrupped 'em—she

“It was one Mr. Warney — a painter, wot lived at

“And did this woman still go by the name of Joplin?”
Bill grinned: “She warn’t such a spooney as that—

“I am satisfied,” said the younger visitor, rising; “there
is the purse, and Mr. R. will bring you ten sovereigns
in addition. Good day to you.”
Bill, with superabundant bows and flourishes, showed
his visitors out, and then, in high glee, he began to romp
with his children; and the whole family circle was in a
state of uproarious enjoyment, when the door flew open,
and in entered Grabman, his brief-bag in hand, dust-soiled,
and unshaven.
“Aha, neighbor! your servant—your servant, —just

weigh on the tip of his forefinger.

pocket; “and who do you think brought me these shiners?
Why, who but old Peggy, the 'oman wot you put out at

BECK's DISCOVERY.
UNDER the cedar-trees, at Laughton, sate that accursed
and abhorrent being, who sate there young, impassioned,
hopeful, as Lucretia Clavering—under the old cedar-trees,
which, save that their vast branches cast an imperceptibly
broader shade over the mossy sward, the irrevocable
winters had left the same. Where, through the nether
boughs, the autumn sunbeams came aslant, the windows,
enriched by many a haughty scutcheon, shone brightly
against the western rays. From the flower-beds in the
quaint garden near at hand, the fresh yet tranquil air
wafted faint perfumes from the lingering heliotrope and
fading rose. The peacock perched dozingly on the heavy
balustrade; the blithe robin hopped busily along the sun-
track on the lawn; in the distance the tinkling bells of the
flock, the plaining low of some wandering heifer, while,
breaking the silence, seemed still to blend with the repose.
All images around lent themselves to complete that picture
of stately calm, which is the character of those old mansion
houses, which owner after owner has loved and heeded,—
leaving to them the graces of antiquity, guarding them
from the desolation of decay.
Alone sate Lucretia, under the cedar-trees, and her

heart made dismal contrast to the noble tranquillity that
breathed around. From whatever softening or repentant
emotions which the scene of her youth might first have
awakened—from whatever of less unholy anguish which
memory might have caused, when she first once more sate
under those remembered boughs, and as a voice from a
former world, some faint whisper of youthful love sighed
across the waste and ashes of her devastated soul,-from all
such rekindled humanities in the past she had now, with
gloomy power, wrenched herself away. Crime, such as hers,
admits not long the sentiment that softens the remorse of
gentler error. If there wakes one moment from the past
the warning and melancholy ghost, soon from that abyss
rises the Fury with the lifted scourge, and hunts on the
frantic footsteps toward the future. In the future, the
haggard intellect of crime must live; must involve itself
mechanically in webs and meshes, and lose past and present
in the welcome atmosphere of darkness.
Thus, while Lucretia sate, and her eyes rested upon the
halls of her youth, her mind overleapt the gulf that yet
yawned between her and the object on which she was bent.
Already, in fancy, that home was hers again;–its present
possessor swept away, the interloping race of Vernon,
ending in one of those abrupt lines familiar to genealogists,
which branch out busily from the main tree, as if all pith
and sap were monopolized by them, continue for a single
generation, and than shrink into a printer's bracket, with
the formal laconism, “Died without issue.” Back, then,
in the pedigree would turn the eye of some curious de-

scendant, and see the race continue in the posterity of
Lucretia Clavering.
With all her ineffable vices, mere cupidity had not, as we
have often seen, been a main characteristic of this fearful
woman; and in her design to endow, by the most de-
termined guilt, her son with the heritage of her ancestors,
she had hitherto looked but little to mere mercenary ad-
vantages for herself; but now, in the sight of that venera-
ble and broad domain, a covetousness, absolute in itself,
broke forth. Could she have gained it for her own use,
rather than her son's, she would have felt a greater zest in
her ruthless purpose. She looked upon the scene as a
deposed monarch upon his usurped realm; it was her
right. The early sense of possession in that inheritance
returned to her. Reluctantly would she even yield her
claims to her child. Here, too, in this atmosphere she
tasted once more what had long been lost to her—the
luxury of that dignified respect which surrounds the well
born. Here, she ceased to be the suspected adventuress,
the friendless outcast, the needy wrestler with hostile
fortune, the skulking enemy of the law. She rose at once,
and without effort, to her original state—the honored
daughter of an illustrious house. The homeliest welcome
that greeted her from some aged but unforgotten villager,
the salutation of homage, the bated breath of humble
reverence—even trifles like these were dear to her, and
made her the more resolute to retain them. In her calm,
relentless, onward vision, she saw herself enshrined in those

halls, ruling in the delegated authority of her son, safe
evermore from prying suspicion and degrading need, and
miserable guilt for miserable objects. Here, but one great
crime, and she resumed the majesty of her youth! While
thus dwelling on the future, her eye did not even turn
from those sunlit towers to the forms below, and more im-
mediately inviting its survey. On the very spot where, at
the opening of this tale, sate Sir Miles St. John, sharing
his attention between his dogs and his guest,-sate now
Helen Mainwaring; against the balustrade, where had
lounged Charles Vernon, leant Percival St. John; and
in the same place where he had stationed himself that
eventful evening, to distort, in his malignant sketch, the
features of his father, Gabriel Warney, with almost the
same smile of irony on his lips, was engaged in transfer-
ring to his canvas a more faithful likeness of the heir's
intended bride. Helen's countenance, indeed, exhibited
comparatively but little of the ravages which the per-
nicious aliment, administered so noiselessly, made upon
the frame. The girl's eye, it is true, had sunk, and there
was a languid heaviness in its look; but the contour of the
cheek was so naturally rounded, and the features so deli-
cately fine, that the fall of the muscles was less evident;
and the bright warm hue of the complexion, and the pearly
sparkle of the teeth, still gave a fallacious freshness to the
aspect. But, as yet, the poisoners had forborne those in-
gredients which invade the springs of life, resorting only
to such as undermine the health and prepare the way to
unsuspected graves Out of the infernal variety of the

materials at their command, they had selected a mixture
which works by sustaining perpetual fever! which gives
little pain, little suffering, beyond that of lassitude and
thirst; which wastes like consumption, and yet puzzles the
physician, by betraying few or none of its ordinary symp-
toms. But the disorder, as yet, was not incurable—its
progress would gradually cease with the discontinuance of
the venom.
Although October was far advanced, the day was as
mild and warm as August. But Percival, who had been
watching Helen's countenance, with the anxiety of love
and fear, now proposed that the sitting should be ad-
journed. The sun was declining, and it was certainly no
longer safe for Helen to be exposed to the air without
exercise. He proposed that they should walk through
the garden, and Helen, rising cheerfully, placed her hand
on his arm. But she had scarcely descended the steps of
the terrace, when she stopped short and breathed hard and
painfully. The spasm was soon over, and, walking slowly
on, they passed Lucretia with a brief word or two, and
were soon out of sight among the cedars.
“Lean more on my arm, Helen,” said Percival. “How
strange it is, that the change of air has done so little for
you, and our country doctor still less! I should feel mis-
erable, indeed, if Simmons, whom my mother always con-
sidered very clever, did not assure me that there was no
ground for alarm—that these symptoms were only nervous

stood in her eyes: “It would be hard to die now, Per-
cival!” she said, falteringly.
“To die— oh, Helen l No; we must not stay here
longer—the air is certainly too keen for you. Perhaps
your aunt will go to Italy—why not all go there, and seek
my mother? And she will nurse you, Helen,-and-
and ” He could not trust his voice further.
Helen pressed his arm tenderly: “Forgive me, dear
Percival—it is but at moments that I feel so despondent
—now, again, it is past. Ah, I so long to see your
mother! when will you hear from her? Are you not too
sanguine 7–do you really feel sure she will consent to so
lowly a choice?”
“Never doubt her affection—her appreciation of you,”
answered Percival, gladly, and hoping that Helen's natural
anxiety might be the latent cause of her dejected spirits:
“often when talking of the future, under these very cedars,
my mother has said—“You have no cause to marry for
ambition—marry only for your happiness.” She never had
a daughter—in return for all her love, I shall give her
that blessing.”
Thus talking, the lovers rambled on till the sun set, and
then, returning to the house, they found that Warney and
Madame Dalibard had preceded them. That evening
Helen's spirits rose to their natural buoyancy. And
Percival's heart was once more set at ease by her silvery
laugh.
When, at their usual early hour, the rest of the family
retired to sleep, Percival remained in the drawing-room,

to write again, and at length, to Lady Mary and Captain
Greville. While thus engaged, his valet entered to say
that Beck, who had been out since the early morning in
search of a horse that had strayed from one of the pas-
tures, had just returned with the animal, who had wandered
nearly as far as Southampton.
“I am glad to hear it,” said Percival, abstractedly, and
continuing his letter.
The valet still lingered—Percival looked up in surprise.
“If you please, sir, you said you particularly wished to
see Beck, when he came back.”
“I—oh, true ! Tell him to wait. I will speak to him
by-and-by-you need not sit up for me—let Beck attend to
the bell.”
The valet withdrew. Percival continued his letter, and
filled page after page, and sheet after sheet; and when at
length the letters, not containing a tithe of what he wished
to convey, were brought to a close, he fell into a reverie
that lasted till the candles burnt low, and the clock from
the turret tolled one. Starting up in surprise at the lapse
of time, Percival then, for the first time, remembered Beck,
and rang the bell.
The ci-devant sweeper, in his smart livery, appeared at
the door.
“Beck, my poor fellow, I am ashamed to have kept you
waiting so long; but I received a letter this morning
which relates to you. Let me see, I left it in my study
up stairs. Ah—you'll never find the way—follow me—I
have some questions to put to you.”

“Nothin' agin my carakter, I hopes, your 'onor?” said
Beck, timidly.
“Oh, no!”
“Noos of the mattris, then?” exclaimed Beck, joyfully.
“Nor that either,” answered Percival, laughing, as he
lighted the chamber candlestick, and, followed by Beck,
ascended the grand staircase to a small room which, as it
adjoined his sleeping apartment, he had habitually used as
his morning writing-room and study.
Percival had, indeed, received that day a letter which
had occasioned him much surprise; it was from John
Ardworth, and ran thus:
“MY DEAR PERCIVAL,-It seems that you have taken
into your service a young man known only by the name of
Beck. Is he now with you at Laughton? If so, pray re-
tain him, and suffer him to be in readiness to come to me at
a day's notice if wanted, though it is probable enough that I
may rather come to you. At present, strange as it may seem
to you, I am detained in London by business connected
with that important personage. Will you ask him carelessly,
as it were, in the mean while, the following questions:
“First. How did he become possessed of a certain child's

“P. S.–Say not a word of the contents of this letter to
Madame Dalibard, Helen, or to any one except Beck.
Caution him to the same discretion. If you can't trust to
his silence, send him to town.”
When the post brought this letter, Beck was already
gone on his errand, and after puzzling himself with vague
conjectures, Percival's mind had been naturally too ab-
sorbed with his anxieties for Helen to recur much to the
subject.
Now, refreshing his memory with the contents of the
letter, he drew pen and ink before him, put the questions
seriatim, noted down the answers as desired, and smiling
at Beck's frightened curiosity to know who could possibly
care about such matters, and feeling confident (from that
very fright) of his discretion, dismissed the groom to his
repose.
Beck had never been in that part of the house before;

and when he got into the corridor, he became bewildered,
and knew not which turn to take—the right or the left.
He had no candle with him; but the moon came clear
through a high and wide skylight; the light, however,
gave him no guide. While pausing, much perplexed, and
not sure that he should even know again the door of the
room he had just quitted, if venturing to apply to his
young master for a clew through such a labyrinth, he was
inexpressibly startled and appalled by a sudden apparition.
A door at one end of the corridor opened noiselessly, and
a figure, at first scarcely distinguishable, for it was robed
from head to foot in a black, shapeless garb, scarcely
giving even the outline of the human form, stole forth.
Beck rubbed his eyes, and crept, mechanically, close within
the recess of one of the doors that communicated with the
passage. The figure advanced a few steps toward him;
and what words can describe his astonishment, when he
beheld thus erect, and in full possession of physical power
and motion, the palsied cripple whose chair he had often
seen wheeled into the garden, and whose unhappy state
was the common topic of comment in the servants’ hall.
Yes, the moon from above shone full upon that face which
never, once seen, could be forgotten. And it seemed more
than mortally stern and pale, contrasted with the sable of
the strange garb, and beheld by that mournful light. Had
a ghost, indeed, risen from the dead, it could scarcely have
appalled him more. Madame Dalibard did not see the
involuntary spy; for the recess in which he had crept was
on that side of the wall on which the moon's shadow was

cast. With a quick step, she turned into another room,
opposite that which she had quitted, the door of which
stood ajar, and vanished noiselessly as she had appeared.
Taught suspicion by his earlier acquaintance with the
“night-side” of human nature, Beck had good cause for
it here, this detection of an imposture most familiar to
his experience—that of a pretended cripple—the hour of
the night—the evil expression on the face of the deceitful
guest—Madame Dalibard's familiar intimacy and near con-
nection with Warney—Warney the visitor to Grabman, who
received no visitors but those who desire not to go to law,
but to escape from its penalties—Warney, who had dared
to brave the Resurrection-man in his den, and who seemed
so fearlessly at home in abodes where naught but poverty
could protect the honest—Warney now, with that strange
woman, an inmate of a house in which the master was so
young, so inexperienced—so liable to be duped by his own
generous nature, all these ideas vaguely combined in-
spired Beck with as vague a terror; surely something, he
knew not what, was about to be perpetrated against his
benefactor—some scheme of villainy which it was his duty
to detect. He breathed hard—formed his resolves, and,
stealing on tiptoe, followed the shadowy form of the poi-
soner through the half-opened doorway. The shutters of
the room of which he thus crossed the threshold were
not closed—the moon shone in bright and still. He kept
his body behind the door—peeping in with straining fear-
ful stare. He saw Madame Dalibard standing beside a
bed, round which the curtains were closed—standing for a

Inoment or so motionless, and as if in the act of listening,
with one hand on a table beside the bed. He then saw
her take from the folds of her dress something white and
glittering, and pour from it, what appeared to him but a
drop or two—cautiously, slowly—into a phial on the table,
from which she withdrew the stopper: that done, she left
the phial where she had found it—again paused a moment,
and turned toward the door. Beck retreated hastily to
his former hiding-place, and gained it in time. Again the
shadowy form passed him, and again the white face in the
white moonlight froze his blood with its fell and horrible
expression. He remained cowering and shrinking against
the wall for some time, striving to collect, his wits, and
considering what he should do. His first thought was to
go at once and inform St. John of what he had witnessed.
But the poor have a proverbial dread of deposing aught
against a superior. Madame Dalibard would deny his
tale—the guest would be believed against the menial—he
should be but dismissed with ignominy. At that idea, he
left his hiding-place, and crept along the corridor, in the
hope of finding some passage at the end which might lead
to the offices. But when he arrived at the other extremity,
he was only met by great folding doors, which evidently
communicated with the state apartments. He must re-
trace his steps—he did so—and when he came to the door
which Madame Dalibard had entered, and which still stood
ajar, he had recovered some courage, and, with courage,
curiosity seized him. For what purpose could the strange
woman seek that room at night thus feloniously—what

could she have poured and with such stealthy caution into
the phial 7 Naturally and suddenly the idea of poison
flashed across him. Tales of such crime (as indeed of all
crime) had necessarily often thrilled the ear of the vagrant
fellow-lodger with burglars and outlaws. But poison to
whom 7 Could it be meant for his benefactor 7 Could
St. John sleep in that room 7–why not? The woman had
sought the chamber before her young host had retired to
rest, and mingled her potion with some medicinal draught.
All fear vanished before the notion of danger to his em-
ployer. He stole at once through the doorway, and noise-
lessly approached the table on which yet lay the phial.
His hand closed on it firmly. He resolved to carry it away,
and consider next morning what next to do. At all events,
it might contain some proof to back his tale and justify his
suspicions. When he came once more into the corridor,
he made a quick rush onward, and luckily arrived at the
staircase. There the blood-red stains reflected on the
stone floors from the blazoned casements daunted him lit-
tle less than the sight at which his hair still bristled. He
scarcely drew breath till he had got into his own little
crib, in the wing set apart for the stablemen, when, at
length, he fell into broken and agitated sleep, the visions
of all that had successively disturbed him waking, united
confusedly, as in one picture of gloom and terror. He
thought that he was in his old loft in St. Giles's; that the
Grave-stealer was wrestling with Warney for his body, while
he himself, lying powerless on his pallet, fancied he should
be safe so long as he could retain, as a talisman, his child's

coral, which he clasped to his heart. Suddenly, in that
black shapeless garb in which he had beheld her, Madame
Dalibard bent over him, with her stern colorless face, and
wrenched from him his charm. Then ceasing his struggle
with his horrible antagonist, Warney laughed aloud, and
the Grave-stealer seized him in his deadly arms.

THE TAP E STRY CHAMBER.
WHEN Beck woke the next morning, and gradually re-
called all that had so startled and appalled him the pre-
vious night—the grateful creature felt, less by the process
of reason than by a brute instinct, that in the mysterious
resuscitation and nocturnal wanderings of the pretended
paralytic some danger menaced his master—he became
anxious to learn whether it was really St. John's room
Madame Dalibard stealthily visited. A bright idea struck
him—and in the course of the day, at an hour when the
family were out of doors, he contrived to coax the good-
natured valet, who had taken him under his special pro-
tection, to show him over the house. He had heard the
other servants say there was such a power of fine things,
that a peep into the rooms was as good as a show, and the
valet felt pride in being cicerone even to Beck. After
having stared sufficiently at the banquet-hall and the
drawing-room, the armor, the busts, and the pictures, and
listened, open-mouthed, to his guide's critical observations,
Beck was led up the great stairs into the old family pic-
ture-gallery, and into Sir Miles's ancient room at the end,
which had been left undisturbed, with the bed still in the
angle; on returning thence, Beck found himself in the

corridor which communicated with the principal bed-rooms,
in which he had lost himself the night before.
“And vot room be that with the littul vite lead hover
the door f" asked Beck, pointing to the chamber from
which Madame Dalibard had emerged.
“That white head, Master Beck, is Floorer the goddess;
but a heathen like you knows nothing about goddesses.
Floorer has a half moon in her hair, you see, which shows
that the idolatrous Turks worship her, for the Turkish flag
is a half moon, as I have seen at Constantinople ! I have
traveled, Beck.”
“And vot room be it? Is it the master's f" persisted
Beck. º
“No, the pretty young lady, Miss Mainwaring, has it
at present. There is nothing to see in it. But that one,
opposite;” and the valet advanced to the door through
which Madame Dalibard had disappeared—"that is curi-
ous; and as Madame is out, we may just take a peep.”
He opened the door gently, and Beck looked in. “This,
which is called the turret-chamber, was Madame's when
she was a girl, I have heard Old Bessy say; so master
pops her there now. For my part, I'd rather sleep in
your little crib, than have those great, gruff-looking figures
staring at me by the firelight, and shaking their heads with
every wind on a winter's night.” And the valet took a
pinch of snuff, as he drew Beck's attention to the faded
tapestry on the walls. As they spoke, the draught be-
tween the door and the window caused the gloomy arras
to wave with a life-like motion: and to those more super-

stitious than romantic, the chamber had certainly no invit.
ing aspect.
“I never sees these old tapestry rooms,” said the valet,
“without thinking of the story of the lady who, coming
from a bail and taking off her jewels, happened to look
up, and saw an eye in one of the figures which she felt sure
was no peeper in worsted.”
“Wot vos it, thin 7” asked Beck, timidly lifting up the
hanging, and noticing that there was a considerable space
between them and the wall, which was filled up in part by
closets and wardrobes set into the wall, with intervals
more than deep enough for the hiding-place of a man.
“Why,” answered the valet, “it was a thief. He had
come for the jewels; but the lady had the presence of
mind to say aloud, as if to herself, that she had forgotten
something, slipped out of the room, locked the door, called
up the servants, and the thief—who was no less a person
than the under-butler—was nabbed.”
“And the French 'oman sleeps 'ere?” said Beck, mus-
ingly,
“French 'oman l Master Beck, nothing's so vulgar as
these nicknames, in a first-rate sitivation. It is all very
well when one lives with skinflints; but with such a mas-
ter as our'n, respect's the go. Besides, Madame is not a
French 'oman; she is one of the family—and as old a
family it is, too, as eler a lord's in the three kingdoms.
But come, your curiosity is satisfied now, and you must
trot back to your horses.”
As Beck returned to the stables, his mind yet more mis-

gave him as to the criminal designs of his master's visitor.
It was from Helen's room that the false cripple had walked,
and the ill health of the poor young lady was a general
subject of compassionate comment. But Madame Dali-
bard was Helen's relation—from what motive could she
harbor an evil thought against her own niece f But still,
if those drops were poured into the healing draught for
good—why so secretly? Once more he revolved the idea
of speaking to St. John—an accident dissuaded him from
this intention; the only proof to back his tale was the
mysterious phial he had carried away; but unluckily, for-
getting that it was in his pocket, at a time when he flung
off his coat to groom one of the horses, the bottle struck
against the corn-bin and broke—all the contents were
spilt. This incident made him suspend his intention, and
wait till he could obtain some fresh evidence of evil inten-
tions. The day passed without any other noticeable occur-
rence. The doctor called, found Helen somewhat better,
and ascribed it to his medicines, especially to the effect of
his tonic draught the first thing in the morning. Helen
smiled—“Nay, doctor,” said she, “this morning, at least,
it was forgotten. I did not find it by my bedside. Don't
tell my aunt, she would be so angry.” The doctor looked
rather discomposed. -
“Well,” said he, soon recovering his good humor, “since
you are certainly better to-day without the draught, discon-
tinue it also to-morrow. I will make an alteration for the
day after ” So that night Madame Dalibard visited in
vain her niece's chamber—Helen had a reprieve.

THE SHADE 8 ON THE DIAL.
THE following morning was indeed eventful to the family
at Laughton; and, as if conscious of what it brought forth,
it rose dreary and sunless; one heavy mist covered all the
landscape, and a raw drizzling rain fell pattering through
the yellow leaves.
Madame Dalibard, pleading her infirmities, rarely left
her room before noon, and Warney professed himself very
irregular in his hours of rising; the breakfast, therefore,
afforded no social assembly to the family, but each took
that meal in the solitude of his or her own chamher. Per-
cival, in whom all habits partook of the healthfulness and.
simplicity of his character, rose habitually early; and that
day, in spite of the weather, walked forth betimes to meet
the person charged with the letters from the post. He
had done so for the last three or four days, impatient to
hear from his mother, and calculating that it was full time
to receive the expected answer to his confession and his
prayer. He met the messenger at the bottom of the park,
not far from Guy's Oak. This day he was not disap-
pointed. The letter-bag contained three letters for him-
self, two with the foreign post-mark—the third in Ard-

worth's hand. It contained also a letter for Madame
Dalibard, and two for Warney.
Leaving the messenger to take these last to the hall,
Percival, with his own prizes, plunged into the hollow of
the glen before him, and, seating himself at the foot of
Guy's Oak, through the vast branches of which the rain
scarcely came, and only in single, mournful drops, he
opened first the letter in his mother's hand, and read as
follows:
“MY DEAR, DEAR SoN,-How can I express to you the
alarm your letter has given to me! So these, then, are the
new relations you have discovered l I fondly imagined
that you were alluding to some of my own family, and
conjecturing who among my many cousins could have so
captivated your attention. These the new relations ! Lu-
cretia Dalibard–Helen Mainwaring ! Percival, do you
not know No, you cannot know—that Helen Main-
•waring is the daughter of a disgraced man—of one who
(more than suspected of fraud in the bank in which he
was a partner) left his country, condemned even by his
own father. If you doubt this, you have but to inquire
at “***, not ten miles from Laughton, where the elder
Mainwaring resided. Ask there, what became of William
Mainwaring. And Lucretia,—you do not know that the
dying prayer of her uncle, Sir Miles St. John, was that
she might never enter the house he bequeathed to your
father. Not till after my poor Charles's death did I know
the exact cause for Sir Miles's displeasure, though confi-

dent it was just; but then among his papers I found the
ungrateful letter which betrayed thoughts so dark, and
passions so unwomanly, that I blushed for my sex to read
it. Could it be possible that that poor old man's prayers
were unheeded — that that treacherous step could ever
cross your threshold—that that cruel eye, which read with
such barbarous joy the ravages of death on a benefactor's
face, could rest on the hearth by which your frank truthful
countenance has so often smiled away my tears, I should
feel, indeed, as if a thunder-cloud hung over the roof.-
No! if you marry the niece, the aunt must be banished
from your house.—Good Heavens ! and it is the daughter
of William Mainwaring, the niece and ward of Lucretia
Dalibard, to whom you have given your faithful affection
—whom you single from the world as your wife l Oh! my
son—my beloved—my sole surviving child—do not think
that I blame you, that my heart does not bleed while I
write thus; but I implore you on my knees to pause at
least—to suspend this intercourse—till I myself can reach
England. And what then? Why, then, Percival, I prom-
ise, on my part, that I will see your Helen with unpreju-
diced eyes—that I will put away from me, as far as possible,
all visions of disappointed pride—the remembrance of faults
not her own; and if she be, as you say and think, I will
take her to my heart and call her “Daughter.” Are you
satisfied ? If so, come to me—come at once, and take
comfort from your mother's lips. How I long to be with
you while you read this—how I tremble at the pain I so
rudely give you! But my poor sister still chains me here;

how sleepless will be my pillow till I hear from you!”
Long, very long, was it before St. John, mute and over-
whelmed with the sudden shock of his anguish, opened his
other letters—the first was from Captain Greville:
“What trap have you fallen into, foolish boy? That
you would get into some silly scrape or another was natural
enough. But a scrape for life, sir—that is serious! But,
God bless you for your candor, my Percival—you have
written to us in time—you are old-fashioned enough to
think that a mother's consent is necessary to a young man's
union. And you have left it in our power to save you yet;
it is not every boyish fancy that proves to be true love.
But enough of this preaching; I shall do better than
write scolding letters, I shall come and scold you in per-

Ardworth's letter was shorter than the others; fortu-
nately so, for otherwise it had been unread:
“If I do not come to you myself the day after you re-
ceive this, dear Percival, which, indeed, is most probable,
I shall send you my proxy, in one whom, for my sake, I
know that you will kindly welcome. He will undertake
my task, and clear up all the mysteries with which, I trust,
my correspondence has thoroughly bewildered your lively
imagination. “Yours, ever,
“JoHN ARDworth.
“GRAY's INN.”
Little, indeed, did Percival's imagination busy itself
with the mysteries of Ardworth's correspondence. His
mind scarcely took in the sense of the words over which
his eye mechanically wandered.
And the letter which narrated the visit of Madame Dali-
bard to the house thus solemnly interdicted to her step,
was on its way to his mother; nay, by this time would
almost have reached her. Greville was on the road; nay,
as his tutor's letter had been forwarded from London–
might perhaps be in Curzon Street that day. How de-
sirable to see him before he could reach Laughton, to pre-
pare him for Madame Dalibard's visit; for Helen's ill-
ness; explain the position in which he was involved, and

conciliate the old soldier's rough, kind heart to his love
and his distress
He did not dread the meeting with Greville; he yearned
for it. He needed an adviser, a confidant, a friend. To
dismiss abruptly his guests from his house—impossible !
to abandon Helen because of her father's crime, or her
aunt's fault (whatever that last might be—and no clear
detail of it was given), that never entered his thoughts!
Pure and unsullied, the starry face of Helen shone the
holier for the cloud around it. An inexpressible and chi-
valrous compassion mingled with his love and confirmed
his faith. She, poor child, to suffer for the deeds of others!
No. What availed his power as man, and dignity as gen-
tleman, if they could not wrap in their own shelter the
one by whom such shelter was now doubly needed? Thus,
amid all his emotions—firm and resolved, at least on one
point—and beginning already to recover the hope of his
sanguine nature, from his reliance on his mother's love, on
the promises that softened her disclosures and warnings,
and on his conviction that Helen had only to be seen for
every scruple to give way, Percival wandered back toward
the house, and, coming abruptly on the terrace, he en-
countered Warney, who was leaning motionless against the
balustrades, with an open letter in his hand. Warney was
deadly pale, and there was the trace of some recent and
gloomy agitation in the relaxed muscles of his cheeks,
usually so firmly rounded. But Percival did not heed his
appearance as he took him gravely by the arm, and lead-
ing him into the garden, said, after a painful pause:

LU CRETIA. 251
“Warney, I am about to ask you two questions, which
your close connection with Madame Dalibard may enable
you to answer; but in which, from obvious motives, I
must demand the strictest confidence. You will not hint
to her or to Helen what I am about to say?”
Warney stared uneasily on Percival's serious counte.
nance, and gave the promise required.
“First, then, for what offense was Madame Dalibard
expelled her uncle's house—this house of Laughton 7
“Secondly, what is the crime with which Mr. Mainwar-
ing, Helen's father, is charged 7”
“With regard to the first,” said Warney, recovering his
composure, “I thought I had already told you that Sir
Miles was a proud man, and that, in consequence of dis-
covering a girlish flirtation between his niece Lucretia
(now Madame Dalibard) and Mainwaring, who afterward
jilted her for Helen's mother, he altered his will—"ex-
pelled her his house,” is too harsh a phrase. This is all I
know. With regard to the second question, no crime was
ever brought home to William Mainwaring. He was sus-
pected of dealing improperly with the funds of the bank,
and he repaid the alleged deficit by the sacrifice of all he
possessed.”
“This is the truth!” exclaimed Percival, joyfully.
“The plain truth, I believe; but why these questions at
this moment? Ah, you too, I see, have had letters—I
understand 1 Lady Mary gives these reasons for withhold-
ing her consent.”
“Her consent is not withheld,” answered Percival; “but,

shall I own it?—remember, I have your promise not to
wound and offend Madame Dalibard by the disclosure:
my mother does refer to the subjects I have alluded to,
and Captain Greville, my old friend and tutor, is on his
way to England—perhaps to-morrow he may arrive at
Laughton.”
“Hal” said Warney, startled—“to-morrow l—and what
sort of a man is this Captain Greville 7”
“The best man possible for such a case as mine—kind
hearted, yet cool, sagacious, the finest observer, the quick-
est judge of character—nothing escapes him. Oh, one
interview will suffice to show him all Helen's innocent and
matchless excellence 1”
“To-morrow ! this man comes to-morrow 7”
"All that I fear is-for he is rather rough and blunt in
his manner—all that I fear is, his first surprise—and, dare
I say, displeasure—at seeing this poor Madame Dalibard,
whose faults, I fear, were graver than you suppose, at the
house from which her uncle—to whom, indeed, I owe this
inheritance »
“I see—I see l’’ interrupted Warney, quickly. “And
Madame Dalibard is the most susceptible of women—so
well born, and so poor, so gifted, and so helpless—it is
natural. Can you not write, and put off this Captain
Greville for a few days 7–until, indeed, I can find some
excuse for terminating our visit.”
“But my letter may be hardly in time to reach him; he
may be in town to-day.”
“Go then to town at once; you can be back late at

ing the pride of a woman on whom, after all, you must
depend for free and open intercourse with Helen.”
“That is exactly what I thought of; but what ex-
cuse ?” *-
“Excuse l—a thousand 1 Every man coming of age into
such a property has business with his lawyers; or why not
say simply that you want to meet a friend of yours, who
has just left your mother in Italy 7–in short, any excuse
suffices, and none can be offensive.”
“I will order my carriage instantly.”
“Rightſ” exclaimed Varney; and his eye followed the
receding form of Percival with a mixture of fierce exulta-
tion and anxious fear. Then turning toward the window
of the turret-chamber, in which Madame Dalibard reposed,
and seeing it still closed, he muttered an impatient oath;
but even while he did so, the shutters were slowly opened,
and a footman, stepping from the porch, approached War-
ney with a message that Madame Dalibard would see him
in five minutes, if he would then have the goodness to
ascend to her room.
Before that time was well expired, Warney was in the
chamber. Madame Dalibard was up, and in her chair:
and the unwonted joy which her countenance evinced was
in strong contrast with the somber shade upon her son-in-
law's brow, and the nervous quiver of his lip.”
“Gabriel,” she said, as he drew near to her, “my son is
found !”
“I know it,” he answered petulantly.

extended a letter while she spoke. He, in return, gave

“Yours, NICHOLAS GRABMAN.”
The letter from Ardworth was no less positive:
“MADAM, In obedience to the commands of a dying
friend, I took charge of his infant, and concealed its exist-
ence from his mother—yourself. On returning to Eng-
land, I need not say that I was not unmindful of my trust.
Your son lives; and, after mature reflection, I have re-
solved to restore him to your arms. In this I have been

of your altered habits, your decorous life, your melancholy
infirmities, and the generous protection you have given to
the orphan of my poor cousin Susan, my old friend Main-
waring. Alfred Braddell himself, if it be permitted to him
to look down and read my motives, will pardon me, I
venture to feel assured, this departure from his injunctions.
Whatever the faults which displeased him, they have been
amply chastised. And your son, grown to man, can no
longer be endangered by example, in tending the couch,
or soothing the repentance, of his mother.
“These words are severe; but you will pardon them in
him who gives you back your child. I shall venture to
wait on you in person, with such proofs as may satisfy you as
to the identity of your son. I count on arriving at Laugh-
ton to-morrow. Meanwhile, I simply sign myself by a
name, in which you will recognize the kinsman to one
branch of your family, and the friend of your dead husband,

“Well! and you are not rejoiced?” said Lucretia,
gazing surprised on Warney's sullen and unsympathizing
face.
“No! because time presses; because, even while dis-
covering your son, you may fail in securing his heritage;
because, in the midst of your triumph, I see Newgate
opening to myself! Look you, I, too, have had my news

month at furthest, and that he meditates, immediately on
his arrival, transferring the legacy from the Bank of Eng-
land to an excellent mortgage of which he has heard.
Were it not for this scheme of ours, nothing would be left
for me but flight and exile.”
“A month l—that is a long time. Do you think, now
that my son is found, and that son one like John Ard-
worth (for there can be no doubt that my surmise was
right), with genius to make station the pedestal to the
power I dreamed of in my youth, but which my sex for-
bade me to attain—do you think I will keep him a month
from his inheritance? Before the month is out, you shall re-
place what you have taken, and buy your trustee's silence,
if need be—either from the sums you have insured, or from
the rents of Laughton.”
“Lucretia!” said Warney, whose fresh colors had grown
livid—“what is to be done must be done at once 1 Per-
cival St. John has heard from his mother. Attend l’’
And Warney rapidly related the questions St. John had
put to him, the dreaded arrival of Captain Greville, the
danger of so keen an observer—the necessity, at all events,
of abridging their visit—the urgency of hastening the
catastrophe to its close.
Lucretia listened in ominous and steadfast silence.
“But,” she said, at last, “you have persuaded St. John
to give this man the meeting in London—to put off his
visit for the time ! St. John will return to us to-morrow.
Well; and if he finds his Helen is no more 1 Two nights
ago I, for the first time, mingled in the morning draught

that which has no antidote and no cure. This night two
drops more, and St. John will return to find that Death is
in the house before him. And then for himself—the sole
remaining barrier between my son and this inheritance,
for himself—why grief sometimes kills suddenly; and
there be drugs whose effect simulates the death-stroke of
grief.”
“Yet, yet, this rapidity, if necessary, is perilous. No-
thing in Helen's state forebodes sudden death by natural
means. The strangeness of two deaths—both so young—
Greville in England, if not here—hastening down to ex-
amine, to inquire, with such prepossessions against you:—
there must be an inquest l”
“Well, and what can be discovered? It was I who
shrunk before—it is I who now urge dispatch. I feel
as in my proper home in these halls. I would not leave
them again but to my gravel I stand on the hearth of
my youth. I fight for my rights and my son's. Perish
those who oppose me!”
A fell energy and power were in the aspect of the mur-
deress as she thus spoke; and while her determination
awed the inferior villainy of Warney, it served somewhat
to mitigate his fears.
As in more detail they began to arrange their execrable
plans, Percival, while the horses were being harnessed to
take him to the nearest post-town, sought Helen, and
found her in the little chamber which he had described and
appropriated as her own, when his fond fancy had sketched
the fair outlines of the future."

258 Lu CRETIA,
This room had been originally fitted up for the private
devotions of the Roman Catholic wife of an ancestor, in
the reign of Charles II.; and in a recess, half veiled by a
curtain, there still stood that holy symbol, which, whether
Protestant or Roman Catholic, no one sincerely penetrated
with the solemn pathos of sacred history can behold un-
moved—the Cross of the Divine Agony. Before this holy
symbol, Helen stood in earnest reverence. She did not
kneel (for the forms of the religion in which she had been
reared were opposed to that posture of worship before the
graven image), but you could see in that countenance,
eloquent at once with the enthusiasm and the meekness
of piety, that the soul was filled with the memories and
the hopes, which, age after age, have consoled the suf-
ferer and inspired the martyr. The soul knelt to the idea,
if the knee bowed not to the image, embracing the tender
grandeur of the sacrifice, and the vast inheritance opened
to faith in the redemption.
The young man held his breath while he gazed. He
was moved, and he was awed. Slowly Helen turned to-
ward him, and, smiling sweetly, held out to him her hand.
They seated themselves in silence in the depth of the over-
hanging casement; and the mournful character of the scene
without, where, dimly through the misty rains, gloomed
the dark foliage of the cedars, made them insensibly draw
closer to each other, in the instinct of love when the world
frowns around it. Percival wanted the courage to say
that he had come to take farewell, though but for a day,
and Helen spoke first.

LUCRETIA. 259
“I cannot guess why it is, Percival, but I am startled
at the change I feel in myself—no, not in health, dear Per-
cival, I mean in mind,—during the last few months;–
since, indeed, we have known each other. I remember so
well the morning in which my aunt's letter arrived at
the dear vicarage. We were returning from the village
fair, and my good guardian was smiling at my notions of
the world. I was then so giddy, and light, and thought-
less—everything presented itself to me in such gay colors,
—I scarcely believed in sorrow. And now I feel as if I
were awakened to a truer sense of nature—of the ends of
our being here; I seem to know that life is a grave and
solemn thing. Yet I am not less happy, Percival. No, I
think, rather, that I knew not true happiness till I knew
you. I have read somewhere that the slave is gay in his
holiday from toil; if you free him, if you educate him, the
gayety vanishes, and he cares no more for the dance under
the palm-tree. But is he less happy? So it is with me!”
“My sweet Helen, I would rather have one gay smile of
old—the arch, careless laugh which came so naturally from
those rosy lips, than hear you talk of happiness with that
quiver in your voice—those tears in your eyes.”
“Yet, gayety,” said Helen, thoughtfully, and in the
strain of her pure, truthful poetry of soul, “is only the
light impression of the present moment—the play of the
mere spirits; and happiness seems a forethought of the
future, spreading on, far and broad, over all time and
space.”
“And you live, then, in the future, at last—you have no

misgivings now, my Helen? Well, that comforts me !
Say it, Helen,-say the future will be ours!”
“It will—it will—forever and forever,” said Helen,
earnestly, and her eyes involuntarily rested on the Cross.
In his younger spirit and less imaginative nature, Per-
cival did not comprehend the depth of sadness implied in
Helen's answer; taking it literally, he felt as if a load
were lifted from his heart, and kissing with rapture the
hand he held, he exclaimed—“Yes, this shall soon—oh,
soon be mine! I fear nothing while you hope. You
cannot guess how those words have cheered me, for I am
leaving you, though but for a few hours, and I shall re-
peat those words—they will ring in my ear, in my heart,
till we meet again.”
“Leaving me!” said Helen, turning pale, and her clasp
on his hand tightened. Poor child! she felt mysteriously
a sentiment of protection in his presence.
“But at most for a day. My old tutor, of whom we
have so often conversed, is on his way to England—per-
haps even now in London. He has some wrong im-
pressions against your aunt—his manner is blunt and
rough. It is necessary that I should see him before he
comes hither—you know how susceptible is your aunt's
pride—just to prepare him for meeting her,-you under-
stand?”
“What impressions against my aunt? Does he even
know her?” asked Helen; and if such a sentiment as sus-
picion could cross that candid innocence of mind—that
sentiment toward this stern relation whose arms had never

embraced her—whose lips had never spoken of the past—
whose history was as a sealed volume, disturbed and dis-
quieted her.
“It is because he has never known her that he does her
wrong. Some old story of her indiscretion as a girl—of
her uncle's displeasure—what matters now?” said Per-
cival, shrinking sensitively from one disclosure that might
wound Helen in her kinswoman. “Meanwhile, dearest,
you will be prudent—you will avoid this damp air, and
keep quietly at home, and amuse yourself, sweet fancier of
the future, in planning how to improve these old halls
when they and their unworthy master are your own. God
bless you!—God guard you, Helen "
He rose, and with that loyal chivalry of love which felt
respect the more for the careless guardianship to which his
Helen was intrusted, he refrained from that parting kiss
which their pure courtship warranted,—for which his lip
yearned. But as he lingered, an irresistible impulse moved
Helen's heart. Mechanically she opened her arms, and
her head sunk upon his shoulder. In that embrace they
remained some moments silent, and an angel might un-
reprovingly have heard their hearts beat through the
stillness.
At length, Percival tore himself from those arms, which
relaxed their imploring hold reluctantly:—she heard his
hurried step descend the stairs, and, in a moment more,
the roll of the wheels in the court without: — a dreary
sense as of some utter desertion, some everlasting bereave-
ment, chilled and appalled her. She stood motionless, as

if turned to stone, on the floor; suddenly the touch of
something warm on her hand—a plaining whine, awoke
her attention;–Percival's favorite dog missed his master,
and had slunk for refuge to her. The dread sentiment of
loneliness vanished in that humble companionship; and,
seating herself on the ground, she took the dog in her
arms, and bending over it, wept in silence.

CHAPTER XXIV.
MURDER, TowARD HIS DESIGN, Moves LIKE A GHOST.
THE reader will, doubtless, have observed the consum-
mate art with which the poisoner had hitherto advanced
upon her prey. The design conceived from afar, and ex-
ecuted with elaborate stealth, defied every chance of detec-
tion against which the ingenuity of practiced villainy could
guard. Grant even that the deadly drugs should betray
the nature of the death they inflicted, that by some uncon-
jectured secret in the science of chemistry, the presence of
those vegetable compounds which had hitherto baffled
every known and positive test, in the posthumous exam-
ination of the most experienced surgeons, should be clearly
ascertained, not one suspicion seemed likely to fall upon
the ministrant of death. The medicines were never brought
to Madame Dalibard, were never given by her hand; no-
thing ever tasted by the victim could be tracked to her
aunt. The helpless condition of the cripple, which Lucre-
tia had assumed, forbade all notion even of her power of
movement. Only in the dead of night, when, as she be-
lieved, every human eye that could watch her was sealed
in sleep, and then in those dark habiliments, which (even,
as might sometimes happen, if the victim herself were
awake), a chance ray of light struggling through chink or

shutter could scarcely distinguish from the general gloom,
—did she steal to the chamber, and infuse the colorless
and tasteless liquid” in the morning draught, meant to
bring strength and healing. Grant that the draught was
untouched—that it was examined by the surgeon—that
the fell admixture could be detected,—suspicion would
wander anywhere rather than to that crippled and helpless
kinswoman, who could not rise from her bed without aid.
But now this patience was to be abandoned, the folds
of the serpent were to coil in one fell clasp upon its prey.
Fiend as Lucretia had become, and hardened as were
all her resolves by the discovery of her son, and her im-
patience to endow him with her forfeited inheritance, she
yet shrank from the face of Helen that day; on the excuse
of illness, she kept her room, and admitted only Warney,
who stole in from time to time, with creeping step and
haggard countenance, to sustain her courage or his own.
And every time he entered, he found Lucretia sitting with
Walter Ardworth's open letter in her hand, and turning
with a preternatural excitement, that seemed almost like
aberration of mind, from the grim and horrid topic which he
invited, to thoughts of wealth, and power, and triumph, and
exulting prophecies of the fame her son should achieve.
He looked but on the blackness of the gulf, and shud-
dered; her vision overleapt it, and smiled on the misty
palaces her fancy built beyond.

LU CRETIA, 265
Late in the evening, before she retired to rest, Helen
knocked gently at her aunt's door, – a voice quick and
startled, <bade her enter; she came in, with her sweet
caressing look, and took Lucretia's hand, which struggled
from the clasp. Bending over that haggard brow, she
said, simply,–yet to Lucretia's ear the voice seemed that
of command,-"Let me kiss you this night !” and her lips
pressed that brow. The murderess shuddered, and closed
her eyes; when she opened them, the angel visitor was
gone.
Night deepened and deepened into those hours from the
first of which we number the morn, though night still is at
her full. Moonbeam and Starbeam came through the case-
ments, shyly, and fairy-like, as on that night when the
murderess was young and crimeless—in deed, if not in
thought—that night when, in the book of Leechcraft, she
meted out the hours in which the life of her benefactor
might still interpose between her passion and its end.
Along the stairs, through the hall, marched the armies of
light—noiseless, and still and clear, as the judgments of
God amid the darkness and shadow of mortal destinies.
In one chamber alone, the folds, curtained close, forbade
all but a single ray—that ray came direct, as the stream
from a lantern, as the beam reflected back from an eye:–
as an eye it seemed watchful and steadfast, through the
dark; it shot along the floor—it fell at the foot of the bed.
Suddenly, in the exceeding hush, there was a strange
and ghastly sound—it was the howl of a dog! Helen
started from her sleep. Percival's dog had followed her

into her room, it had coiled itself, grateful for the kind-
ness, at the foot of the bed. Now it was on the pillow,
she felt its heart beat against her hand; it was trembling;
its hairs bristled up, and the howl changed into a shrill
bark of terror and wrath. Alarmed, she looked round:
quickly between her and that ray from the crevice, a
shapeless Darkness passed, and was gone l So undistin-
guishable, so without outline, that it had no likeness of any
living form:—like a cloud, like a thought, like an omen,
it came in gloom, and it vanished.
Helen was seized with a superstitious terror—the dog
continued to tremble and growl low. All once more was
still—the dog sighed itself to rest. The stillness, the soli-
tude—the glimmer of the moon—all contributed yet more
to appall the enfeebled nerves of the listening, shrinking
girl. At length she buried her face under the clothes,
and toward daybreak fell into a broken feverish sleep,
haunted with threatening dreams.

C. H. A. PTE R XXV.
THE MESSENGER SPEEDS.
TowARD the afternoon of the following day, an elderly
gentleman was seated in the coffee-room of a hotel at
Southampton, engaged in writing a letter, while the waiter
in attendance was employed on the wires that fettered the
petulant spirit contained in a bottle of Schweppe's soda-
water. There was something in the aspect of the old gen-
tleman, and in the very tone of his voice, that inspired
respect, and the waiter had cleared the other tables of
their latest newspapers to place before him. He had only
just arrived by the packet from Havre, and even the news-
papers had not been to him that primary attraction they
generally constitute to the Englishman returning to his
bustling native land, which, somewhat to his surprise, has
contrived to go on tolerably well during his absence.
We use our privilege of looking over his shoulder while
he writes:
“Here I am, then, dear Lady Mary, at Southampton,
and within an easy drive of the old hall! A file of Galig-
nani's Journals, which I found on the road between Mar-
seilles and Paris, informed me, under the head of ‘fashion-
able movements,’ that ‘Percival St. John, Esq., was gone

to his seat at Laughton.” According to my customary
tactics of marching at once to the seat of action, I there-
fore made direct for Havre, instead of crossing from Calais,
and I suppose I shall find our young gentleman engaged
in the slaughter of hares and partridges. You see, it is
a good sign that he can leave London. Keep up your
spirits, my dear friend. If Perce has been really duped
and taken in,-as all you mothers are so apt to fancy,
rely upon an old soldier to defeat the enemy and expose
the ruse. But if, after all, the girl is such as he describes
and believes,—innocent, artless, and worthy his affection,--
oh, then I range myself, with your own good heart, upon
his side. Never will I run the risk of unsettling a man's
whole character for life by wantonly interfering with his
affections. But there we are agreed.
“In a few hours I shall be with our dear boy, and his
whole heart will come out clear and candid as when it beat
under his midshipman's true blue. In a day or two, I shall
make him take me to town to introduce me to the whole
nest of them. Then I shall report progress. Adieu, till
then I Kind regards to your poor sister. I think we shall
have a mild winter. Not one warning twinge, as yet, of
the old rheumatism.

The captain had completed his letter, sipped his soda-
water, and was affixing to his communication his seal,
when he heard the rattle of a post-chaise without. Fan-

cying it was the one he had ordered, he went to the open
window which looked on the street; but the chaise con-
tained travelers, only halting to change horses. Somewhat
to his surprise, and a little to his chagrin—for the captain
did not count on finding company at the hall,—he heard
one of the travelers in the chaise ask the distance to Laugh-
ton. The countenance of the questioner was not familiar
to him. But, leaving the worthy captain to question the
landlord, without any satisfactory information, and to
hasten the chaise for himself, we accompany the travelers
on their way to Laughton. They were but two —the
proper complement of a post-chaise—and they were both
of the ruder sex. The elder of the two was a man of
middle age, but whom the wear and tear of active life had
evidently advanced toward the state called elderly. But
there was still abundant life in his quick, dark eye; and
that mercurial youthfulness of character, which in some
happy constitutions seems to defy years and sorrows,
evinced itself in a rapid play of countenance, and as much
gesticulation as the narrow confines of the vehicle and
the position of a traveler will permit. The younger man,
far more grave in aspect and quiet in manner, leaned back
in the corner with folded arms, and listened with respect-
ful attention to his companion.
“Certainly, Dr. Johnson is right—great happiness in
an English post-chaise properly driven l—more exhilara-
ting than a palanquin: “Post equitem sedet alra cura’—

—eh, my boy!” As he spoke this, the gentleman had
twice let down the glass of the vehicle, and twice put it
up again.
“Yet,” he resumed, without noticing the brief, good-
humored reply of his companion—“yet this is an anxious
business enough that we are about. I don't feel quite
easy in my conscience. Poor Braddell's injunctions were
very strict, and I disobey them. It is on your responsi-
bility, John "
“I take it without hesitation. All the motives for so
stern a severance must have ceased, and is it not a suffi-
cient punishment to find, in that hoped-for son, a -"
“Poor woman l’ interrupted the elder gentleman, in
whom we begin to recognize the soi-disant Mr. Tomkins
—“true, indeed—too true. How well I remember the
impression Lucretia Clavering first produced on me;—
and to think of her now as a miserable cripple ! By Jove,
you are right, sir! Drive on, postboy, quick, quick!”
There was a short silence.
The elder gentleman, abruptly, put his hand upon his
companion's arm.
“What consummate acuteness—what patient research
you have shown What could I have done in this busi-
ness without you? How often had that garrulous Mrs.
Mivers bored me with Becky Carruthers, and the coral,
and St. Paul's, and not a suspicion came across me:—a

feeling old Joplin from place to place, till you find her

herself! Wonderful f Ah, boy, you will be an honor to
the law, and to your country. And what a hard-hearted
rascal you must think me, to have deserted you so long !”
“My dear father,” said John Ardworth, tenderly—“your
love now recompenses me for all. And ought I not rather
to rejoice not to have known the tale of a mother's shame,
until I could half forget it on a father's breast?”
“John,” said the elder Ardworth, with a choking voice,
“I ought to wear sackcloth all my life, for having given
you such e mother. When I think what I have suffered
from the habit of carelessness in those confounded money
matters—(“irritamenta malorum,' indeed!), I have only
one consolation, that my patient, noble son is free from
my vice. You would not believe what a well-principled,
honorable fellow I was at your age, and yet, how truly I
said to my poor friend, William Mainwaring, one day at
Laughton (I remember it now)—"Trust me with anything
else but half a guineal’ Why, sir, it was that fault that
threw me into low company—that brought me in contact
with my innkeeper's daughter at Limerick. I fell in love,
and I married (for, with all my faults, I was never a
seducer, John). I did not own my marriage; why should
I? my relatives had cut me already. You were born, and
hunted poor devil as I was, I forgot all by your cradle.
Then, in the midst of my troubles, that ungrateful woman
deserted me—then, I was led to believe that it was not my
own son whom I had kissed and blessed. Ah, but for
that thought should I have left you as I did And even
in infancy, you had the features only of your mother.

Then, when the death of the adulteress set me free, and
years afterward, in India, I married again, and had new
ties—my heart grew still harder to you. I excused my-
self by knowing that at least you were cared for, and
trained to good by a better guide than I. But when, by
so strange a hazard, the very priest who had confessed
your mother on her death-bed (she was a Catholic) came
to India, and (for he had known me at Limerick) recog-
nized my altered person, and obeying his penitent's last
injunctions, assured me that you were my son,-oh, John,
then, believe me, I hastened back to England on the wings
of remorse! Love you, my boy! I have left at Madras
three children, young and fair, by a woman now in heaven,
who never wronged me, and, by my soul, John Ardworth,
you are dearer to me than all!”
The father's head drooped on his son's breast as he
spoke; then, dashing away his tears, he resumed:
“Ah, why would not Braddell permit me, as I proposed,
to find for his son the same guardianship as that to which
I intrusted my own; but his bigotry besotted him; —a
clergyman of the high church,--that was worse than an
atheistl I had no choice left to me but the roof of that
she-hypocrite. Yet I ought to have come to England
when I heard of the child's loss, braved duns and all; but

CHAPTE R XXVI.
THE SPY FLIES.
MEANwHILE, at Laughton, there was confusion and
alarm. Helen had found herself more than usually un-
well in the morning; toward noon, the maid who at-
tended her informed Madame Dalibard that she was afraid
the poor young lady had much fever, and inquired if the
doctor should be sent for. Madame Dalibard seemed sur-
prised at the intelligence, and directed her chair to be
wheeled into her niece's room, in order herself to judge of
Helen's state. The maid, sure that the doctor would be
summoned, hastened to the stables, and seeing Beck, in-
structed him to saddle one of the horses and to await
further orders. Beck kept her a few moments talking,
while he saddled his horse, and then followed her into the
house, observing that it would save time if he were close
at hand.
“That is quite true,” said the maid, “and you may as
well wait in the corridor. Madame may wish to speak to
you herself, and give you her own message or note to the
doctor.”
Beck, full of gloomy suspicions, gladly obeyed; and
while the maid entered the sick chamber, stood anxiously
without. Presently Warney passed him, and knocked at
Helen's door; the maid half opened it.

“How is Miss Mainwaring 7” said he eagerly.
“I fear she is worse, sir, but Madame Dalibard does
not think there is any danger.”
“No danger! I am glad; but pray ask Madame Dali-
bard to let me see her for a few moments, in her own
room. If she come out I will wheel her chair to it.
Whether there is danger or not, we had better send for
other advice than this country doctor, who has perhaps
mistaken the case; tell her I am very uneasy, and beg
her to join me immediately.”
“I think you are quite right, sir,” said the maid, closing
the door.
Warney then, turning round for the first time, noticed
Beck, and said, roughly:
“What do you do here? Wait below till you are sent
for.”
Beck pulled his forelock, and retreated back, not in the
direction of the principal staircase, but toward that used
by the servants, and which his researches into the topog-
raphy of the mansion had now made known to him. To
gain these back stairs he had to pass Lucretia's room;
the door stood ajar; Warney's face was turned from him.
Beck breathed hard, looked round, then crept within, and
in a moment was behind the folds of the tapestry.
Soon the chair in which sate Madame Dalibard was
drawn by Warney himself into the room.
Shutting the door with care, and turning the key,
Gabriel said, with low, suppressed passion:
“Well; your mind seems wandering—speak!”

“No,” interrupted Lucretia. “No; she came into the
room—she kissed me here, on the brow that even then
was meditating murder. The kiss burned ; it burns still
—it eat into the brain, like remorse. But I did not yield
—I read again her false father's protestation of love—I
read again the letter announcing the discovery of my son,
and remorse lay still—I went forth as before—I stole into
her chamber—I had the fatal crystal in my hand 77

“And suddenly there came the fearful howl of a dogl
and the dog's fierce eyes glared on me—I paused—I
trembled—Helen started, woke, called aloud—I turned
and fled. The poison was not given.”
Warney ground his teeth. “But this illness! Ha! the
effect, perhaps, of the drops administered two nights ago.”
“No I this illness has no symptoms like those the poison
should bequeath; it is but natural fever, a shock on the
nerves; she told me she had been wakened by the dog's
howl, and seen a dark form, like a thing from the grave,
creeping along the floor. But she is really ill—send for
the physician; there is nothing in her illness to betray the
hand of man. Be it as it may—that kiss still burns—I
will stir in this no more. Do what you will yourself!”
“Fool, fool!” exclaimed Warney, almost rudely grasp-
ing her arm. “Remember how much we have yet to
prepare for—how much to do—and the time so shortl

physician sends. And when Percival returns—his Helen
dead or dying—I will attend on him / Silent still 2 Re-
call your son 1 Soon you will clasp him in your arms as
a beggar or as the lord of Laughton "
Lucretia shuddered, but did not rise; she drew forth a
ring of keys from her bosom, and pointed toward a secre-
tary. Warney snatched the keys, unlocked the secretary,
seized the fatal casket, and sate down quietly before it.
When the dire selections were made, and secreted about
his person, Warney rose, approached the fire, and blew the
wood embers to a blaze.
“And now,” he said, with his icy irony of smile, “we
may dismiss these useful instruments, perhaps forever.
Though Walter Ardworth, in restoring your son, leaves
us dependent on that son's filial affection, and I may have,
therefore, little to hope for from the succession, to secure
which I have risked, and am again to risk my life, I yet
trust to that influence which you never fail to obtain over
others. I take it for granted that, when these halls are
Wincent Braddell's, we shall have no need of gold, nor of
these pale alchemies. Perish, then, the mute witnesses of
our acts l—the elements we have bowed to our will 1 No
poisons shall be found in our hoards! Fire, consume your
consuming children l’
As he spoke, he threw upon the hearth the contents of
the casket, and set his heel upon the logs. A bluish flame
shot up, breaking into countless sparks, and then died.

:

Lucretia watched him, without speaking.
In coming back toward the table, Warney felt something
hard beneath his tread; he stooped, and picked up the
ring which has before been described as among the ghastly
treasures of the casket, and which had rolled on the floor,
almost to Lucretia's feet, as he had emptied the contents
on the hearth.
“This, at least, need tell no tales,” said he—“a pity to
destroy so rare a piece of workmanship—one, too, which
we never can replace l’’
“Ay,” said Lucretia, abstractedly,–"and, if detection
comes, it may secure a refuge from the gibbet—give me
the ring !”
“A refuge more terrible than the detection,” said Warney
—“beware of such a thought;” as Lucretia, taking it from
his hand, placed the ring on her finger.
“And now, I leave you for awhile, to recollect yourself
—to compose your countenance, and your thoughts. I
will send for the physician.”
Lucretia, with her eyes fixed on the floor, did not heed
him, and he withdrew. -
So motionless was her attitude—so still her very breath-
ing—that the unseen witness behind the tapestry, who,
while struck with horror at what he had overheard (the
general purport of which it was impossible that he could
misunderstand), was parched with impatience to escape—
to rescue his beloved master from his impending fate, and
warn him of the fate hovering nearer still over Helen,-
ventured to creep along the wall to the threshold—to peer

forth from the arras, and seeing her eyes still downcast, to
emerge, and place his hand on the door.
At that very moment Lucretia looked up and saw him
gliding from the tapestry—their eyes met—his were fasci-
nated as the bird's by the snake's. At the sight, all her
craft—her intellect returned. With a glance, she compre-
hended the terrible danger that awaited her. Before he
was aware of her movement, she was at his side—her hand
on his own—her voice in his ear.
“Stir not a step—utter not a sound—or you are »
Beck did not suffer her to proceed. With the violence
rather of fear than of courage, he struck her to the ground;
but she clung to him still; and, though rendered for the
moment speechless by the suddenness of the blow, her eyes
took an expression of unspeakable cruelty and fierceness.
He struggled with all his might to shake her off; as he
did so, she placed feebly her other hand upon the wrist of
the lifted arm that had smitten her, and he felt a sharp
pain, as if the nails had fastened into the flesh. This but
exasperated him into new efforts. He extricated himself
from her grasp, which relaxed, as her lips writhed into a
smile of scorn and triumph, and, spurning her while she
lay before the threshold, he opened the door, sprang for-
ward, and escaped. No thought had he of tarrying in
that House of Pelops, those human shambles, of denounc-
ing Murder in its lair;-to fly, to reach his master, warn
and shield him—that was the sole thought which crossed
his confused, bewildered brain.
It might be from four to five minutes, that Lucretia,

half stunned, half senseless, lay upon those floors; for,
besides the violence of her fall, the shock of the struggle,
upon nerves weakened by the agony of apprehension, oc-
casioned by the imminent and unforeseen chance of detec-
tion, paralyzed her wondrous vigor of mind and frame,
when Warney entered.
“They tell me she sleeps,” he said, in hoarse muttered
accents, before he saw the prostrate form at his very feet.
But Warney's step, Warney's voice, had awakened Lu-
cretia's reason to consciousness and the sense of peril.
Rising, though with effort, she related hurriedly what had
passed.
“Fly—fly l’” she gasped, as she concluded. “Fly—to
detain, to secrete this man somewhere, for the next few
hours. Silence him but till then—I have done the rest!”
—and her finger pointed to the fatal ring.
Warney waited for no further words; he hurried out,
and made at once to the stables; his shrewdness conjec-
tured that Beck would carry his tale elsewhere. The groom
was already gone (his fellow said)—without a word, but
toward the lodge that led to the Southampton road.
Warney ordered the swiftest horse the stables held to be
saddled, and said, as he sprang on its back:
“I, too, must go toward Southampton—the poor young
lady!—I must prepare your master—he is on his road
back to us;” and the last word was scarce out of his lips
as the sparks flew from the flints under the horse's hoofs,
and he spurred from the yard.
As he rode at full speed through the park, the villain's

mind sped more rapidly than the animal he bestrode–
sped from fear to hope—hope to assurance. Grant that
the spy lived to tell his tale—incoherent, improbable as
the tale would be—who would believe it? How easy to
meet tale by tale! The man must own that he was secreted
behind the tapestry;-wherefore but to rob? Detected by
Madame Dalibard, he had coined this wretched fable. And
the spy, too, could not live through the day—he bore
Death with him as he rode—he fed its force by his speed
—and the effects of the venom itself would be those of
frenzy. Tush! his tale, at best, would seem but the rav-
ings of delirium. Still, it was well to track him where he
went, delay him, if possible ; and Warney's spurs plunged
deep and deeper into the bleeding flanks: on desperately
scoured the horse. He passed the lodge—he was on the
road—a chaise and pair dashed by him—he heard not a
voice exclaim “Warney!”—he saw not the wondering face
of John Ardworth;-bending over the tossing mane—he
was deaf, he was blind, to all without and around. A
milestone glides by, another, and a third. Ha! his eyes
can see now. The object of his chase is before him—he
views distinctly, on the brow of yon hill, the horse and the
rider, spurring fast, like himself. They descend the hill,
horse and horseman, and are snatched from his sight. Up
the steep strains the pursuer. He is at the summit. He
sees the fugitive before him, almost within hearing. Beek
has slackened his speed; he seems swaying to and fro in
the saddle. Ho, ho! the barbed ring begins to work in
his veins! Warney looks round—not another soul is in

sight—a deep wood skirts the road. Place and time seem
to favor—Beck has reined in his horse—he bends low over
the saddle, as if about to fall. Warney utters a half-sup-
pressed cry of triumph, shakes his reins and spurs on—
when, suddenly (by the curve of the road, hid before), an-
other chaise comes in sight, close where Beck had wearily
halted.
The chaise stops—Warney pulls in and draws aside to
the hedge-row ! Some one within the vehicle is speaking
to the fugitivel May it not be St. John himself? To his
rage and his terror, he sees Beck painfully dismount from
his horse—sees him totter to the door of the chaise—sees
a servant leap from the box and help him up the step—
sees him enter. It must be Percival on his return Per-
cival, to whom he tells that story of horror Warney's
brute-like courage forsook him—his heart was appalled.
In one of those panics so common with that boldness
which is but animal, his sole thought became that of es-
cape. He turned his horse's head to the fence—forced his
way desperately through the barrier—made into the wood,
and sate there, cowering and listening, till in another
minute he heard the wheels rattle on, and the horses gal-
lop hard down the hill toward the park.
The autumn wind swept through the trees—it shook the
branches of the lofty ash that overhung the Accursed One.
What observer of nature knows not that peculiar sound
which the ash gives forth in the blast—not the solemn
groan of the oak—not the hollow murmur of the beech,
but a shrill wail—a shriek, as of a human voice in sharp

anguish. Warney shuddered, as if he had heard the death-
cry of his intended victims 1 Through briars and thickets,
torn by the thorns, bruised by the boughs—he plunged
deeper and deeper into the wood—gained at length the
main path cut through it—found himself in a lane, and
rode on, careless whither, till he had reached a small town,
about ten miles from Laughton, where he resolved to wait
till his nerves had recovered their tone and he could more
calmly calculate the chances of safety.

LUCRETIA REGAINS HER SON
IT seemed as if now, when danger became most immi-
nent and present—that that very danger served to restore
to Lucretia Dalibard all her faculties, which during the
earlier day had been steeped in a kind of dreary stupor.
The absolute necessity of playing out her execrable part
with all suitable and consistent hypocrisy, braced her into
iron. But the disguise she assumed was a supernatural
effort—it stretched to cracking every fiber of the brain.
It seemed almost to herself as if, her object once gained,
either life or consciousness could hold out no more l
A chaise stopped at the porch—two gentlemen de-
scended. The elder paused irresolutely, and at length,
taking out a card, inscribed “Mr. Walter Ardworth,”
said, “If Madame Dalibard can be spoken to for a mo-
ment, will you give her this card?
The footman hesitatingly stared at the card, and then
invited the gentlemen into the hall, while he took up the
message. Not long had the visitor to wait, pacing the
dark oak floors and gazing on the faded banners, before
the servant reappeared—Madame Dalibard would see him.
He followed his guide up the stairs; while his young com-

panion turned from the hall, and seated himself musingly
on one of the benches on the deserted terrace.
Grasping the arms of her chair with both hands, her
eyes fixed eagerly on his face, Lucretia Dalibard awaited
the welcome visitor.
Prepared as he had been for change, Walter was startled
by the ghastly alteration in Lucretia's features, increased,
as it was that moment, by all the emotions which raged
within. He sank into the chair placed for him opposite
Lucretia, and, clearing his throat, said falteringly:
“I grieve indeed, madam, that my visit, intended to
bring but joy, should chance thus inopportunely. The
servant informed me, as we came up the stairs, that your
niece was ill, and I sympathize with your natural anxiety
—Susan's only child, too—poor Susan l’”
“Sir,” said Lucretia, impatiently, “these moments are
precious. Sir—sir! — my son — my son 1” and her eyes
glanced to the door. “You have brought with you a
companion,--does he wait without 2—My son 1"
“Madam, give me a moment's patience. I will be brief,
and compress what, in other moments, might be a long
narrative, into a few sentences.”
Rapidly, then, Walter Ardworth passed over the details,
unnecessary now to repeat to the reader; the injuretions
of Braddell, the delivery of the child to the woman se-
lected by his fellow-sectarian (who, it seemed, by John
Ardworth's recent inquiries, was afterward expelled the
community, and who, there was reason to believe, had
been the first seducer of the woman thus recommended).


## p. 285 (#643) ############################################

LUCRETIA. 285
No clew to the child's parentage had been given to the
woman, with the sum intrusted for his maintenance, which
sum had perhaps been the main cause of her reckless
progress to infamy and ruin. The narrator passed lightly
over the neglect and cruelty of the nurse, to her abandon-
ment of the child when the money was exhausted. For-
tunately, she had overlooked the coral round its neck. By
that coral, and by the initials, W. B., which Ardworth had
had the precaution to have burned into the child's wrist,
the lost son had been discovered; the nurse herself (found
in the person of Martha Skeggs, Lucretia's own servant)
had been confronted with the woman to whom she gave
the child, and recognized at once. Nor had it been diffi-
cult to obtain from her the confession which completed the
evidence.
“In this discovery,” concluded Ardworth, “the person
I employed met your own agent, and the last links in the
chain they traced together. But to that person, to his
zeal and intelligence,—you owe the happiness I trust to
give you. He sympathized with me the more that he
knew you personally, felt for your sorrows, and had a lin-
gering belief that you supposed him to be the child you
yearned for. Madam, thank my son for the restoration of
your own l’
Without sound, Lucretia had listened to these details,
though her countenance changed fearfully as the narrator
proceeded. But now she groaned aloud and in agony.
“Nay, madam,” said Ardworth, feelingly and in some
surprise, “surely the discovery of your son should create

gladder emotions. Though, indeed, you will be prepared
to find that the poor youth so reared wants education and
refinement, I have heard enough to convince me that his
dispositions are good and his heart grateful. Judge of
this yourself; he is in these walls—he is 77
“Abandoned by a harlot — reared by a beggar ! My
son 1" interrupted Lucretia, in broken sentences. “Well,
sir, have you discharged your task l Well have you re-
placed a mother l’’
Before Ardworth could reply, loud and rapid steps were
heard in the corridor, and a voice, cracked, indistinct, but
.vehement. The door was thrown open, and, half sup.
ported by Captain Greville, half dragging him along—
his features convulsed, whether by pain or passion,-the
spy upon Lucretia's secrets, the denouncer of her crime,
tottered to the threshold. Pointing to where she sat with
his long, lean arm, Beck exclaimed: “Seize her l I 'cuse
her, face to face, of the murder of her niece l–of–of 1
told you, sir—I told you—”
“Madam,” said Captain Greville, “you stand charged
by this witness with the most terrible of human crimes. I
judge you not. Your niece, I rejoice to hear, yet lives l
Pray God that her death be not traced to those kindred
hands !”
Turning her eyes from one to the other with a wander-
ing stare, Lucretia Dalibard remained silent. But there
was still scorn on her lip and defiance on her brow. At
last she said, slowly, and to Ardworth :
“Where is my son? You say he is within these walls

—call him forth to protect his motherl Give me, at least,
my son—my son 1"
Her last words were drowned by a fresh burst of fury
from her denouncer. In all the coarsest invective his edu-
cation could supply—in all the hideous vulgarities of his
untutored dialect—in that uncurbed licentiousness of tone,
look, and manner which passion, once aroused, gives to
the dregs and scum of the populace, Beck poured forth
his frightful charges—his frantic execrations. In vain
Captain Greville strove to check him. In vain Walter
Ardworth sought to draw him from the room. But while
the poor wretch—maddening not more with the conscious-
ness of the crime, than with the excitement of the poison
in his blood—thus raved and stormed, a terrible suspicion
crossed Walter Ardworth : mechanically—as his grasp
was on the accuser's arm—he bared the sleeve, and on the
wrist were the dark blue letters, burned into the skin, and
bearing witness to his identity with the lost Wincent Brad-
dell.
“Hold, hold!” he exclaimed then—“hold, unhappy
man!—it is your mother whom you denounce l’”
Lucretia sprang up erect—her eyes seemed starting
from her head; she caught at the arm pointed toward her
in wrath and menace—and there, amid those letters that
proclaimed her son, was the small puncture surrounded by
a livid circle, that announced her victim. In the same
instant she discovered her child in the man who was calling
down upon her head the hatred of Earth and the justice of
Heaven, and knew herself his murderess.

She dropped the arm, and sank back on the chair; and,
whether the poison had now reached to the vitals, or
whether so unwonted a passion in so frail a frame sufficed
for the death-stroke, Beck himself, with a low suffocated
cry, slid from the hand of Ardworth, and, tottering a step
or so, the blood gushed from his mouth, over Lucretia's
robe; —his head drooped an instant, and falling, rested
first upon her lap—then struck heavily upon the floor.
The two men bent over him and raised him in their arms
—his eyes opened and closed—his throat rattled, and, as he
fell back into their arms a corpse, a laugh rose close at hand
—it rang through the walls, it was heard near and afar—
above and below. Not an ear in that house that heard it
not. In that laugh fled forever, till the Judgment-day,
from the blackened ruins of her lost soul, the reason of the
mnrderess mother.

THE LOTS WANISH WITHIN THE URN.
WARNEY's self-commune restored to him his constitu-
tional audacity. He returned to Laughton toward the
evening, and held a long conference with Greville. For-
tunately for him, perhaps, and happily for all, Helen had
lost all more dangerous symptoms, and the physician who
was in the house saw in her state nothing not easily to be
accounted for by natural causes. Percival had arrived,
had seen Helen—no wonder she was better. Both from
him and from Helen, Madame Dalibard's fearful condition
was for the present concealed. Ardworth's story, and the
fact of Beck's identity with Vincent Braddell, were also
reserved for a later occasion. . . . The tale which Beck
had poured into the ear of Greville (when recognizing
the St. John livery the captain stopped his chaise to in-
quire if Percival were at the hall, and when, thrilled by
the hideous import of his broken reply, that gentleman
had caused him to enter the vehicle to explain himself
further), Warney, with his wonted art and address, con-
trived to strip of all probable semblance. Evidently the
poor lad had been already delirious, his story must be
deemed the nightmare of his disordered reason. Warney
insisted upon surgical examination as to the cause of his

death—the membranes of the brain were found surcharged
with blood, as in cases of great mental excitement—the
slight puncture in the wrist, ascribed to the prick of a
rusty nail, provoked no suspicion. If some doubts re-
mained still on Greville's acute mind, he was not eager to
express, still less to act, upon them. Helen was declared
to be out of danger. Percival was safe — why affix by
minute inquiry into the alleged guilt of Madame Dalibard
(already so awfully affected by the death of her son and by
the loss of her reason) so foul a stain on the honored family
of St. John ” But Greville was naturally anxious to free
the house, as soon as possible, both of Warney and that
ominous Lucretia, whose sojourn under its roof seemed
accursed. He therefore readily assented when Warney
proposed — as his obvious and personal duty—to take
charge of his mother-in-law, and remove her to London
for immediate advice.
At the dead of the black-clouded night—no moon and
no stars—the son of Olivier Dalibard bore away the form
of the once formidable Lucretia:—the form, for the mind
was gone — that teeming, restless, and fertile intellect,
which had carried along the projects, with the preter.
human energies of the fiend, was hurled into night and
chaos. Manacled and bound, for at times her paroxysms
were terrible, and all partook of the destructive and mur-
derous character, which her faculties, when present, had
betrayed, she was placed in the vehicle by the shrinking
side of her accomplice.
Long before he arrived in London, Warney had got rid

of his fearful companion. His chaise had stopped at the
iron gates of a large building, somewhat out of the main
road, and the doors of the Madhouse closed on Lucretia
Dalibard.
Warney then hastened to Dover with intention of flight
into France; he was just about to step into the vessel
when he was tapped rudely on the shoulder, and a de-
termined voice said—“Mr. Gabriel Warney, you are my
prisoner!” -
“For what—some paltry debt?” said Warney haughtily.
“For forgery on the Bank of England!”
Warney's hand plunged into his vest. The officer seized
it in time, and wrested the blade from his grasp. Once
arrested for an offense it was impossible to disprove, al-
though the very smallest of which his conscience might
charge him, Warney sank into the blackest despair. Though
he had often boasted, not only to others, but to his own
vain breast, of the easy courage with which, when life
ceased to yield enjoyment, he could dismiss it by the act
of his own will—though he had possessed himself of Lu-
cretia's murderous ring, and death, if fearful, was therefore
at his command, self-destruction was the last thought that
occurred to him—that morbid excitability of fancy, which,
whether in his art or in his deeds, had led him to strange
delight in horror, now served but to haunt him with the
images of death in those ghastliest shapes familiar to them
who look only into the bottom of the charnel, and see but
the rat and the worm, and the loathsome agencies of cor-
ruption. It was not the despair of conscience that seized

him, it was the abject clinging to life;—not the remorse of
the soul,—that still slept within him, too noble an agency
for one so debased—but the gross physical terror. As
the fear of the tiger once aroused is more paralyzing than
that of the deer, proportioned to the savageness of a dis-
position to which fear is a novelty, so the very boldness of
Warney, coming only from the perfection of the nervous
organization, and unsupported by one moral sentiment,
once struck down, was corrupted into the vilest cowardice.
With his audacity, his shrewdness forsook him. Advised
by his lawyer to plead guilty, he obeyed, and the sentence
of transportation for life gave him, at first, a feeling of re-
prieve; but when his imagination began to picture, in the
darkness of his cell, all the true tortures of that penalty,
not so much, perhaps, to the uneducated peasant felon,
inured to toil, and familiarized with coarse companionship,
as to one pampered like himself by all soft and half wo-
manly indulgences—the shaven hair—the convict's dress
—the rigorous privation—the drudging toil;-the exile
seemed as grim as the grave. In the dotage of faculties
smitten into driveling — he wrote to the Home Office,
offering to disclose secrets connected with crimes that had
hitherto escaped or baffled justice, on condition that his
sentence might be repealed, or mitigated into the gentler
forms of ordinary transportation. No answer was returned
to him—but his letter provoked research—circumstances
connected with his uncle's death, and with various other
dark passages in his life—sealed against him all hope of
more merciful sentence, and when some acquaintances

whom his art had made for him, and who, while grieving
for his crime, saw in it some excuse (ignorant of his feller
deeds), sought to intercede in his behalf, the reply of the
Home Office was obvious, “He is a fortunate man to have
been tried and condemned for his least offense.” Not
one indulgence that could distinguish him from the most
execrable ruffian, condemned to the same sentence, was
conceded.
The idea of the gibbet lost all its horror. Here was a
gibbet for every hour ! No hope—no escape. Already
that Future Doom which comprehends the “Forever”
opened upon him, black and fathomless. The hour-glass
was broken up—the hand of the time-piece was arrested.
The Beyond stretched before him, without limit, without
goal—on into Annihilation or into Hell.

STAND, O Man upon the hill-top—in the stillness of
the evening hour—and gaze, not with joyous, but with
contented eyes, upon the beautiful world around thee!
See where the mists, soft and dim, rise over the green
meadows, through which the rivulet steals its way! See
where, broadest and stillest, the wave expands to the full
smile of the setting sun–and the willow that trembles on
the breeze—and the oak that stands firm in the storm, are
reflected back, peaceful both, from the clear glass of the
tides 1 See where, begirt by the gold of the harvests, and
backed by the pomp of a thousand groves, the roofs of
the town bask noiseless in the calm glow of the sky! Not
a sound from those abodes floats in discord to thine ear,
only from the church-tower, soaring high above the rest,
perhaps faintly heard through the stillness, swells the note
of the holy bell. Along the mead low skims the swallow
—on the wave, the silver circlet, breaking into spray, shows
the sport of the fish. See the Earth, how serene, though
all eloquent of activity and life! See the Heavens, how
benign, though dark clouds, by yon mountain, blend the

to thine eye. Below the glass of that river, the pike darts
on his prey; the circle in the wave, the soft plash among
the reeds, are but signs of Destroyer and of Victim. In
the ivy round the oak, by the margin, the owl hungers for
the night, which shall give its beak and its talons living
food for its young; and the spray of the willow trembles
with the wing of the redbreast, whose bright eye sees the
worm on the sod. Canst thou count too, O Man! all the
cares—all the sins—that those noiseless roof-tops conceal?
With every curl of that smoke to the sky, a human thought
soars as dark, a human hope melts as briefly. And the
bell from the church-tower, that to thy ear gives but music,
perhaps knolls for the dead. The swallow but chases the
moth, and the cloud, that deepens the glory of the heaven
and the sweet shadows on the earth, nurses but the thunder
that shall rend the grove and the storm that shall devastate
the harvests. Not with fear, not with doubt, recognize, O
Mortal, the presence of Evil in the world.* Hush thy
heart in the humbleness of awe, that its mirror may reflect
as serenely the shadow as the light. Wainly, for its moral,
dost thou gaze on the landscape, if thy soul puts no check
on the dull delight of the senses. Two wings only raise

the world. The lesson it inculcates would be lost, if so construed;
but that the mystery of evil, whatever its degree, only increases
the necessity of faith in the vindication of the contrivance which
requires infinity for its range, and eternity for its consummation.
It is in the existence of evil that man finds his duties, and his soul
its progress.

Beck sleeps in the church-yard of Laughton. He had
lived to frustrate the monstrous design intended to benefit
himself, and to become the instrument, while the victim of
the dread Eumenides. That done, his life passed with the
crimes that had gathered around, out of the sight of mortals.
Helen slowly regained her health in the atmosphere of love
and happiness; and Lady Mary soon learned to forget the
fault of the father in the virtues of the child. Married to
Percival, Helen fulfilled the destinies of woman's genius,
in calling forth into action man's earnest duties. She
breathed into Percival's warm beneficent heart her own
more steadfast and divine intelligence. Like him she grew
ambitious, by her he became distinguished. While I write,
fair children play under the cedars of Laughton. And the
husband tells the daughters to resemble their mother;-
and the wife's highest praise to the boys is—“You have
spoken truth or done good like your father.”
John Ardworth has not paused in his career, nor belied
the promise of his youth. Though the elder Ardworth,
partly by his own exertions, partly by his second marriage
with the daughter of the French merchant through whose
agency he had corresponded with Fielden, had realized a
moderate fortune, it but sufficed for his own wants, and for

the children of his later nuptials, upon whom the bulk of
it was settled. Hence, happily perhaps for himself and
others, the easy circumstances of his father allowed to John
Ardworth no exemption from labor. His success in the
single episode from active life to literature did not intoxi-
cate or mislead him. He knew that his real element was
not in the field of letters, but in the world of men. Not
undervaluing the noble destinies of the Author, he felt
that those destinies, if realized to the utmost, demanded
powers other than his own; and that man is only true to
his genius when the genius is at home in his career. He
would not renounce for a brief celebrity distant and solid
fame. He continued for a few years in patience and priva-
tion, and confident self-reliance, to drudge on, till the oc-
cupation for the intellect fed by restraint, and the learning
accumulated by study, came and found the whole man
developed and prepared. Then, he rose rapidly from step
to step—then, still retaining his high enthusiasm, he en-
larged his sphere of action from the cold practice of law,
into those vast social improvements which law, rightly
regarded, should lead, and vivify, and create. Then, and
long before the twenty years he had imposed on his proba-
tion had expired, he gazed again upon the senate and the
abbey, and saw the doors of the one open to his resolute
tread, and anticipated the glorious sepulcher which heart
and brain should win him in the other.
John Ardworth has never married. When Percival
rebukes him for his celibacy, his lip quivers slightly, and
he applies himself with more dogged earnestness to his

is lonely or his affections void. For him who aspires, and
for him who loves, life may lead through the thorns, but
it never stops in the desert.
On the minor personages involved in this history there
is little need to dwell. Mr. Fielden, thanks to St. John,
has obtained a much better living in the rectory of Laugh-
ton; but has found new sources of pleasant trouble for
himself, in seeking to drill into the mind of Percival's
eldest son the elements of Euclid and the principles of
Latin syntax. -
We may feel satisfied that the Miverses will go on much
the same while trade enriches without refining, and while,
nevertheless, right feelings in the common paths of daty

We may rest assured that the poor widow who had
reared the lost son of Lucretia, received from the bounty
of Percival all that could comfort her for his death.
We have no need to track the dull crimes of Martha,
or the quick, cunning vices of Grabman, to their inevitable
goals, in the hospital or the prison, the dunghill or the
gibbet.
Of the elder Ardworth our parting notice may be less
brief. We first saw him in sanguine and generous youth,
with higher principles and clearer insight into honor than
William Mainwaring. We have seen him next a spend-
thrift and a fugitive, his principles debased and his honor
dimmed. He presents to us no uncommon example of
the corruption engendered by that vulgar self-indulgence

No Deity presides where Prudence is absent. Man, a
world in himself, requires, for the development of his facul-
ties, patience; and for the balance of his actions, order.
Even where he had deemed himself most oppressively
made the martyr—viz., in the profession of mere political
opinions, Walter Ardworth had but followed out into
theory the restless, uncalculating impatience, which had
brought adversity on his manhood, and, despite his con-
stitutional cheerfulness, shadowed his age with remorse.
The death of the child committed to his charge, long
(perhaps to the last) embittered his pride in the son whom,
without merit of his own, Providence had spared to a
brighter fate. But for the faults which had banished him
his country, and the habits which had seared his sense of
duty, could that child have been so abandoned and have
so perished 7
It remains only to cast our glance over the punishments
which befell the sensual villainy of Warney, the intellect-
ual corruption of his fell step-mother.
These two persons had made a very trade of those crimes
to which man's law awards death. They had said in their
hearts that they would dare the crime, but elude the
penalty. By wonderful subtlety, craft, and dexterity,
which reduced guilt to a science, Providence seemed, as
in disdain of the vulgar instruments of common retribu-
tion, to concede to them that which they had schemed for,

detection of his darker and more inexpiable crimes, pun-

Behold that dark ship on the waters! Its burdens are
not of Ormus and Tyre. No goodly merchandise doth it
waft over the wave, no blessing cleaves to its sails;
freighted with terror and with guilt, with remorse and
despair, or more ghastly than either, the sullen apathy of
souls hardened into stone, it carries the dregs and offal of
the Old World to populate the New. On a bench in that
ship, sit side by side two men, companions assigned to each
other. Pale, abject, cowering, all the bravery rent from his
garb, all the gay insolence vanished from his brow—can
that hollow-eyed, haggard wretch be the same man whose
senses opened on every joy, whose nerves mocked at every
peril? But beside him, with a grin of vile glee on his
features, all muscle and brawn in the form, all malice at
once spiteful and dull in his heavy eye, sits his fit comrade
—the Grave-stealer l At the first glance each had recog-
nized each, and the prophecy and the vision rushed back
upon the daintier convict. If he seek to escape from him,
the Grave-stealer claims him as a prey, he threatens him

sit, and laughs at the writhing of the pain. Carry on
your gaze from the ship:—hear the cry from the mast-
head—see the land arise from the wastel A land without
hope I At first, despite the rigor of the Home Office,
the education and intelligence of Warney have their price
—the sole crime for which he is convicted is not of the
darkest. He escapes from that hideous comrade, he can
teach as a school-master;-let his brain work, not his
hands ! But the most irredeemable of convicts are ever
those of nurture and birth and culture better than the
ruffian-rest. You may enlighten the clod, but the meteor
still must feed on the marsh: and the pride and the vanity
work where the crime itself seems to lose its occasion.
Ever avid, ever grasping, he falls, step by step, in the foul
sink, and the colony sees in Gabriel Warney its most
pestilent rogue; arch-convict amid convicts, doubly lost
among the damned; they banish him to the sternest of the
penal settlements—they send him forth with the vilest to
break stones upon the roads. Shriveled, and bowed, and
old prematurely——see that sharp face peering forth among
that gang, scarcely human,—see him cringe to the lash of
the scornful overseer—see the pairs chained together, night
and day! Ho, ho! his comrade hath found him again, the
Artist and the Grave-stealer leashed together 1 Conceive

or gravely shake the head and hurry on, where the fanatic
raves his Apocalypse, and reigns in judgment on the
world;—you pass by strong grates into corridors gloomier
and more remote. Nearer and nearer, you hear the yell
and the oath and blaspheming curse—you are in the heart
of the Madhouse, where they chain those at once cureless
and dangerous—who have but sense enough left them to
smite, and to throttle, and to murder. Your guide opens
that door, massive as a wall, you see (as we, who narrate,
have seen her) Lucretia Dalibard:—a grisly, squalid, fe-
rocious mockery of a human being—more appalling and
more fallen than Dante ever fabled in his specters, than
Swift ever scoffed in his Yahoos!—Only where all other
feature seems to have lost its stamp of humanity, still
burns with unquenchable fever—the red devouring eye.
That eye never seems to sleep, or, in sleep, the lid never
closes over it. As you shrink from its light, it seems to
you as if the mind that had lost coherence and harmony,
still retained latent and incommunicable consciousness as
its curse. For days, for weeks—that awful maniac will
preserve obstinate, unbroken silence; but, as the eye never
closes, so the hands never rest—they open and grasp, as if
at some palpable object on which they clºse, vice-like, as
a bird's talons on its prey—sometimes they wander over
that brow, where the furrows seem torn as the thunder-
scars, as if to wipe from it a stain, or charm from it a pang
—sometimes they gather up the hem of that sordid robe,
and seem, for hours together, striving to rub from it a soil.

Then, out from prolonged silence, without cause or warn-

with the effort, sinks senseless into stupor), the frightful
laugh. But speech, intelligible and coherent, those lips
rarely yield.
There are times, indeed, when the attendants are per-
suaded that her mind in part returns to her; and those
times, experience has taught them to watch with peculiar
caution. The crisis evinces itself by a change in the man-
ner—by a quick apprehension of all that is said—by a
straining anxious look at the dismal walls—by a soft fawn-
ing docility—by murmured complaints of the chains that
fetter—and (though, as we have said, but very rarely) by
prayers, that seem rational, for greater ease and freedom.
In the earlier time of her dread captivity, perhaps, when
it was believed at the asylum that she was a patient of
condition, with friends who cared for her state, and would
liberally reward her cure, they, in those moments, relaxed
her confinement, and sought the gentler remedies their art
employs; but then invariably, and, it was said, with a cun-
ning that surpassed all the proverbial astuteness of the
mad, she turned this indulgence to the most deadly uses—
she crept to the ballet of some adjacent sufferer weaker than
herself, and the shrieks that brought the attendants into
the cell scarcely saved the intended victim from her hands.
It seemed, in those imperfectly lucid intervals, as if the
reason only returned to guide her to destroy—only to ani-
mate the broken mechanism into the beast of prey.

Years have now passed since her entrance within those
walls. He who placed her there never had returned—he
had given a false name—no clew to him was obtained—
the gold he had left was but the quarter's pay. When
Warney had been first apprehended, Percival requested
the younger Ardworth to seek the forger in prison—and
to question him as to Madame Dalibard; but Warney was
then so apprehensive that, even if still insane, her very
ravings might betray his share in her crimes, or still more,
if she recovered, that the remembrance of her son’s mur-
der would awaken the repentance and the confession of
crushed despair, that the wretch had judged it wiser to say
that his accomplice was no more—that her insanity had
already terminated in death. The place of her confine-
ment thus continued a secret locked in his own breast.
Egotist to the last, she was henceforth dead to him—why
not to the world? Thus the partner of her crimes had
cut off her sole resource, in the compassion of her uncon-
scious kindred;—thus the gates of the living world were
shut to her evermore. Still, in a kind of compassion, or
as an object of experiment—as a subject to be dealt with
unscrupulously in that living dissection-hall—her grim
jailers did not grudge her an asylum. But, year after
year, the attendance was more slovenly—the treatment
more. harsh; and strange to say, while the features were
scarcely recognizable—while the form underwent all the
change which the shape suffers when mind deserts it, that

Not for the coarse object of creating an idle terror—not
for the shock upon the nerves and the thrill of the grosser
interest which the narrative of crime creates, has this book
been compiled from the facts and materials afforded to the
author. When the great German poet describes, in not
the least noble of his lyrics, the sudden apparition of some
“Monster Fate” in the circles of careless Joy, he assigns
to him who teaches the world through parable or song,
the right to invoke the specter. It is well to be awakened
at times from the easy commonplace that surrounds our
habitual life—to cast broad and steady, and patient light
on the darker secrets of the heart; on the vaults and
caverns of the social state, over which we build the mar-
ket-place and the palace. We recover from the dread,
and the awe, and the half incredulous wonder, to set closer
watch upon our inner and hidden selves. In him who cul-
tivates only the reason, and suffers the heart and the spirit
to lie waste and dead, who schemes, and constructs, and
revolves round the axle of self, unwarmed by the affec-
tions, unpoised by the attraction of right, lies the germ

CERTAIN criticisms on “LUCRETIA,” at its first appearance,
having been made the vehicle for remarks of no common virulence
on the author's general writings, he took the occasion thus af-
forded to him to put forth, in the following pages, entitled “A
WoRD To THE PUBLIc,” not only a vindication of his own ethical
designs, in his various fictions, but an exposition of the preroga-
tives of inventive art in the selection of the agencies employed
toward moving the passions of pity and terror. The “WoRD To
THE PUBLIc” is still retained as an appendix to this romance: for
though it may be no longer needed as a defense of the works which
Time itself has sufficed to clear from the charges to which they
were once subjected, it may still have an interest to the general
reader as a somewhat elaborate analysis of the main causes that
conduce to emotions legitimately tragic. If, therefore, it have any
value, it is less as the vindication which an author makes of his
own works, than as the result of the study he has devoted to the
master-pieces of others;—in short, as a critical essay—offering sug-
gestions as to the grander uses of imaginative compositions in the
passions which they openly sway, and the warnings which they
unconsciously bequeath.

HINTS TOWARD A CRITICAL ESSAY UPON THE ARTISTIC
PRINCIPLES AND ETHICAL DESIGNS OF FICTION.
IT is not as a retort to attacks that I write these pages.
They are designed, it is true, to remove errors, whether of
willful misstatement, or honest misconception, on subjects
affecting myself. But as those subjects are connected with
interests in literature very general and important, I shall
endeavor to preserve the dispassionate tone proper to an
inquiry addressed to the candor of the public and the con-
sideration of educated men.
I pass by all assaults that may appear to have exceeded
the due license of criticism with the single remark, that
wherever personal motives are strong enough to violate
the ordinary decorum of literary censure, the reader must
be prepared to expect that they will suffice to corrupt all
integrity of statement. Thus extracts will be garbled and
misquoted—sentences stripped of the context that explains
them,-and opinions, which the writer most earnestly holds
up to reprobation, and places in the lips of characters
whom he draws but to condemn, be deliberately cited as
the sentiments of the author himself. I do not stop to
comment on artifices like these; if, from no broader prin-
ciple than that of justice to the author, they need rebuke
or are capable of discouragement—discouragement and re.

buke will come more efficiently from others; nor should I
have made even this brief reference to matters not immedi-
ately essential to my argument, if some temporary injustice
to the author were the only evil such practices could pos-
sibly effect; but thus, a work the most innocent can not
only be represented as mischievous, but in reality rendered
so. Let me forestall the subsequent inquiry, and assume
for the moment that the true moral, whether of “Eugene
Aram,” or the “Children of Night,” be either salutary or
harmless, and then let me suppose it gravely asserted in
some two or three of those popular journals which penetrate
every corner of society, read alike by the educated and the
ignorant, the good and the bad—the sole vehicles of literary
information to those whom it is most facile and most danger-
ous to mislead—that the author, a man of some social posi-
tion, and some acknowledged repute in letters, lends all the
weight of his name and authority to the defense and encour-
agement of crime, is the author himself the party most seri-
ously aggrieved? The injury done to him may be wholly
effaced by the gradual influence of the judicious, and the tran-
quil investigation of time; but is it so easy to efface the injury
effected by garbled extracts, and willful misrepresentation,
upon minds uninstructed and perverted, at which the book
itself, with its real lessons, never may arrive, and which
only too readily accept the sanction that the newspaper
assures them it affords?
So far as concerns myself, I am contented to appeal,
from assailants of this kind, to those cultivators of litera-
ture with whom I may claim fellowship, and to that public,
who, I trust, have connected gentler associations with my
name.
With regard to those purely literary faults and defects
which afford the fair questions to criticism, though, some
years since, I might have been tempted to enter into the

vindication of a few, at least, out of the many with which
I have been charged, I am not now disposed to intrude
upon the public a defense against censures morally unim-
portant and legitimately made. Good or bad, my works
have been written with such care as I could bestow on
them; and in all that affects their literary reputation alone,
I willingly leave them to that calm and equitable decision
between praise and blame which time only can pronounce.
I confine myself to questions of graver moment than
those which relate to the mere skill or ability displayed by
a living writer in the treatment of the subjects he selects,
and if I would borrow something from indulgence, it is
only a certain leniency, whenever an earnest wish to cor-
rect misconception may render me tedious in explanation.
For the charges against me are not limited to a single
work; and it is necessary that I should invite an inquiry,
from the warrantable conclusions of which, I trust, my
entire vindication will proceed, viz., into the recognized
principles of fiction, and the fair liberty in the choice of
materials, which it is the interest, both of art and the
public, to permit to imaginative writers.
In this discussion, I ask, then, but for that patience
with which we listen to the most ordinary mechanic, when
at home in the subject of a craft to which his toil and life
have been applied. For several years, I have studied the
art of which I treat; and it is but reasonable to suppose
that I should speak with some knowledge of the principles
which, applied to practice, have gained me whatever repu-
tation I possess. I will presume that the reader enters on
the consideration of the matters which he is called upon to
adjudicate, not with a mind steeled against conviction, and
determined to resist, but rather with a juryman's sincere
desire to judge for himself, and exclude from the trial all
that he has heard out of court;—regretting generously if,

at the close, he is obliged to condemn, rejoicing honestly if
his reason and his conscience allow him to acquit. And
if there be many who come to this inquiry with minds so
prepared, among them there may be those who unthink-
ingly have done me wrong, and who, after hearing the
evidence I shall adduce, and more carefully considering
the laws by which I should be judged, may depart from
the hearing with a manly desire to repair an injury—small,
indeed, if it were as lightly felt as it is heedlessly inflicted
It is not so easy, as at first it may appear, to decide
upon the moral tendencies and designs of a writer. Upon
no conceivable subject have more signal mistakes been
made; and none affords us a more memorable warning to
judge of others with modest charity and cautious delibera-
tion. It would take a large catalogue to contain the titles
of those books which have been denounced as immoral and
mischievous, and which are now universally acknowledged
as the sources of harmless pleasure or ethical instruction.
From the father of poetry, from Homer himself-who has
been charged “with degrading the gods, and demoralizing
man”—“sanctioning perjury and avarice”—“holding up
even parricides to reverence”—“teaching what is wicked,
and debasing what is good,”—through the long order of
his illustrious children,- we can find few whom we now
recognize among our most genial civilizers, and our gen-
tlest teachers, who have not, at one time or another, been
subjected to the common charge of immoral tendency and
pernicious effect.
Since the good Bishop Heliodorus saw his tale of Thea-
genes and Chariclea condemned by a synod, as preju-
dicial to the young; since Mohammed denounced in the
Koran those harmless tales, of which the Arabian Nights
are a sample, novelists have been treated, if possible, more
harshly than their elder brothers the poets. There is no

social converse of mankind, as ‘The Prince' of Machiavel
is in their political intercourse.” There is no tale that
with safer conscience we submit to the simplest under-
standing, than the Rasselas of Dr. Johnson, and yet it
has been charged with instilling the same, more than
doubtful, moral, that freezes men's hopes in the mockery
of Candide.f. Philosophers the most earnest, moralists
the most rigid, have been as liable to this erring accusa-
tion as the wildest of poets and the most careless of ro-
mancers. Locke presides over our academies, yet he has
been denounced as the founder of a sect of materialists.
Cudworth is received among the holiest champions of re-
ligion, yet Warburton informs us that he never published
the second part of his work, because of the malignity that
had visited the first. In the same painful and warning
mistake of shallow judgments, our divines themselves have
been assailed, and the twin lights of our religious litera-
ture, Tillotson and Taylor, calumniated—the one as a
Socinian in disguise, the other as a schismatic in design.

tomb shut out the sweets of the atonement from the bit-
terness of the wrong ! Happy he, too, who, early inured
to calumny, grows indifferent to its sting ! He will not,
at least, die a lunatic, like Ritson, “stabbed by assassins
in the dark,”—nor like Cummyns, waste away “in the
slow ſever produced by an anonymous assault.”
Do not let me be suspected of so egregious a conceit, as
implying a claim to association with the lofty names that I
have cited. I but use the argument the citations suggest,
to establish the simple truth which literary history affords
to a more intelligent, and, I trust, a more liberal age, viz.,
that the public should receive with great caution rash ac-
cusations against the motives of authors and the latent im-
morality of works. For, easy to the lowest understanding
is this general charge of immoral tendency and object—
and tempting it is to malice, when it cannot deny the liter-
ary reputation which it envies—to assail the moral design,
because that (always more or less complicated) needs some
effort beyond the commonplace indifference of the public to
perceive and to defend. Of whatever is plainly obscene
and licentious, of whatever openly assails the acknowledged
principles of religion, or saps the moral foundations of so-
ciety, all men may judge; and on these, at least in our
own age, no differences of opinion are likely to exist. But
the wise and the honest will be wary of ascribing to writers
secret tendencies and objects at variance, not only with the
designs they announce, but the reputation accorded to them
by judges, whether at home or abroad, uninfluenced by per-
sonal predilections or political bias. And I fear that the
writer, the most really dangerous to society is to be found
in the critic, who bids the young and unthinking search,
amid the most popular forms of literature, for excuses to

vice and sanctions to crime, which the author himself never
intended, and which, without such directions, no reader
would have suspected. It is critics like these who would
pervert to poison the most innocent intellectual nutriment;
who would interpret the exhortations of St. Augustine into
an appeal to the passions, or the “whole Duty of Man”
into a libel on one's neighbor. Shortly after Addison's
“Cato” had appeared upon the stage, an unhappy person
destroyed himself, leaving upon his table a paper with
these words:
“That must be good
Which Cato did and Addison approved.”
One must mournfully regret this poor man's perverse mis-
construction of “Cato;” yet who can say, for that reason,
that “Cato” is dangerous, or that Addison sanctioned sui-
cide 7 But, suppose that Addison had lived, and “Cato”
been produced, in our day, and suppose that some writer
in one of our popular journals had, after some prelude
upon “morbid idiosyncrasies and the frequency of sui-
cides,” instead of removing from such “morbid idiosyn-
crasies” the dangerous impression that Addison approved
self-slaughter—preferred rather to gratify a spleen against
the poet, in asserting that the design of the tragedy and
the purpose of the author were devoted to the mischievous
vindication of suicide—would not that writer have incurred
the gravest responsibilities, afforded to “morbid idiosyn-
crasies” the very stimulus it was his duty to withhold, and
encouraged the very error it was his duty to expose ? Let
the editor of every influential journal weigh well the con-
siderations this reflection should suggest, and perhaps he
may confess that the more readily an author's intention

quickest and readiest facility toward correcting such mis.
takes, should seek not to confirm but dispel the dangerous
misconception.
It is not given to all to have genius—it is given to all
to have honesty of purpose; an ordinary writer may have
this in common with the greatest—that he may compose
his works with sincere and distinct views of promoting
truth and administering to knowledge. I claim this in-
tention fearlessly for myself. And if, contrary to my most
solemn wishes, and my most thoughtful designs, any one of
my writings can be shown, by dispassionate argument, to
convey lessons tending to pervert the understanding and .
confound the eternal distinction between right and wrong,
I will do my best to correct the error, by stamping on it
my own condemnation, and omitting it from the list of
those it does not shame me to acknowledge.
Every reader, who has honored my books with some at-
tention, must long since have recognized in their very im-
perfections as works of art—the favorite and peculiar
studies of their author; some, especially, of the compan-
ions of my youth, must often have traced to those inquiries,
which we pursued together through the labyrinth of meta-
physics, and amid the ingenious speculations of writers
who have sought by the analysis of our ideas to arrive at
the springs of our manifold varieties in conduct, that over-
indulgence of moralizing deductions, and those often tedi-
ous attempts to explain the workings of mind, which have
weakened the effect of my characters, and interrupted the
progress of my plots. But no man can have made the
study of the great investigators of human conduct his pas-
sion and his habit, and ever consciously and willfully medi-
tate a work at variance with morality;—more likely is it
that he will err in the opposite extreme, and undertake no
work, however light, without a purpose too sharply defi-

nite. Even in the object on which he is most intent, it is
true that he may err, the gravest moralists, the wisest
divines, have so erred; human judgment cannot be in-
fallible :
“Tacere
Tutum semper erit.”—
“If one would be safe, one has no resource but to be
silent.” But an error of this kind is one only of mistaken,
yet honest intention, and may surely be exposed, without
heated invectives and calumnious personalities.
What is the charge that has been brought against me—
urged and reurged, in words which I will not trust myself
to repeat, and in a spirit which I will not pause to expose?
I state its broad substance, I believe fairly, in this, “That
I have had a morbid and mischievous passion for treating
of crime and guilt—that it is the prevailing character of
my books to make heroes of criminals and felons.”
Now it is the interest of all writers, from the greatest
poet to the meanest novelist, that the due license of fiction
in the materials it selects should be clearly laid down and
generally admitted. And it is no less to the interest of
the public, that writers should not be scared, by tacit ac-
quiescence in charges most painful to honorable men, from
whatever exposition of evil as it exists—whatever investi-
gation of the human mind, in its sublimity or its baseness,
its virtues or its guilt, the uniform example of received
authorities in literature has proved it to be salutary or
safe to permit to the scope of the poet and the purpose of
the teacher.
I shall proceed to show that, if the delineation of crime
did afford the ordinary and favorite subject of my works—
if criminals or felons were made what is called heroes
(that is, the leading characters) in all or most of them,-

such a charge would only prove the ignorance of those
who advance it, whether of the most acknowledged privi-
leges of fiction, or the scope of the moral which writers
the most blameless have been left at liberty to develop and
enforce. But the charge itself is so utterly untrue, that a
single glance over the list of my publications will suffice
to refute it. I annex that list as my reply:

asterisk are the only books in which felons or criminals
have been made the heroes. In works professing to treat
of human life in all its complexities, this is surely but a
small proportion assigned to the express delineation of
human crimes. And this list alone, to those who have
read the works, is a sufficient answer to the charge—that
it has been my habit as an author to select criminals and
felons as my heroes. Five of the fictions I have cited are
devoted to the historical illustration of former times, with
whatever images, fair or noble, the age might afford, or
the progress of the narrative present; six to those circles
of modern society, in which it was difficult to avoid the op-
posite reproach of dealing exclusively with the more polished
or more frivolous classes, and forgetting that, beneath the
surface of manners, grave and stern lessons are to be found—
yes, even in the guilt and the woe which are at work within
the deeps; and two out of the number (“Zanoni” and
“The Pilgrims of the Rhine”) are dedicated to fancies
which may be called, if you please, too visionary and un-
real, but are wholly remote from that grosser and more
actual world of evil and sin, to which I am accused of
having morbidly confined my invention, or monotonously
directed my research.
In each and all of these, no doubt, there are (could they
paint life without, or has any novelist attempted to do so?)
characters good and bad. But in none of my books (save
the three before mentioned) has crime been made the lead-
ing agency, or a criminal the predominant character. In
most of them, indeed, the fairer and gentler side of human
nature has been not unfavorably exhibited; in most of
them, I believe, the characters that remain the more vividly
clear in the remembrance of an impartial reader, will be
associated with such qualities as dignify or endear our
species.

To only three fictions out of sixteen, then, does the charge
so indiscriminately made against all, shrink in its appli-
cation; viz., that “I have sought materials in crime, and
heroes in criminals.” We come, then, at once to a ques-
tion, which common sense and universal authority ought
long since to have decided; viz., “How far the delineation
of crime is a legitimate object of fictitious composition.”
It would seem from the hackneyed repetition of the same
accusation against me, and the vehemence with which it is
accompanied, that I had had the discredit to introduce into
fiction some hideous innovation, opposed by the greatest
writers or at variance with the usual privileges of my call-
ing. But what is the fact Y Has not the delineation of
crime, in every age, been the more especial and chosen
thesis of the greatest masters of art quoted to us as au-
thorities and held up to us as models 7 The parricide of
GEdipus furnishes inspiration to the all-perfect and all-
polished genius of Sophocles; Medea murders her chil-
dren; Clytemnestra her husband; Orestes his mother;
Phaedra woos her step-son. I grant all that may be said
as to differences of ancient manners and habits of thought;
but these very same subjects have been readapted to the
modern stage, adorned by the greatest geniuses of France,
in an age when she especially prided herself on the purity
of her drama and the humanity of her audiences. They
are enrolled among the master-pieces of Racine, Corneille,
and Voltaire. They are incorporated with the drama of
Italy. In England they furnish plots to the authors who
were listened to as Reformers of the Stage from its ruder
barbarities and grosser license.
Turn to the titles in the earlier editions of Shakspeare's
plays, and they even seem to invite attention by the prom-
ise of the crimes they are to depict. What are we to say

Or “The Tragedie of Macbeth, showing how, by treach-

Or “Othello, the Moore of Venice, his deathe and

I attach no weight to these titles themselves, of which
Shakspeare is doubtless innocent; but they certainly do
not exaggerate the crimes which the plays depict. Crime,
in fact, is the essential material of the Tragic Drama.
Take crime from tragedy, and you annihilate tragedy it-
self. Whatever aims at the tragic effect, whether on the
stage or in more sober narrative, cannot dispense with the

not Shakspeare's, or his only in part, but which we admit into our

murders, rapes—amputating hands, plucking forth tongues, hew-
ing off heads—stabbing with a joke of “Weke, weke, so cries a
pig”—cutting throats on the stage, while Lavinia between her
stumps holds a basin for the blood, serving up to a mother her
children baked in a pie, etc. Why is not this play (no matter
whose it be) to be banished from our collections? Because, here,
time has brought healthful discernment; because, whatever the
defective art which introduces such gratuitous horrors in “Titus
Andronicus,” every one knows that they do not contaminate the
moral sense; the image of crime, made execrable, may pain and
revolt us, but for that very reason it does not allure or corrupt.

the innocent in its own ruin, and conduces to the tragic
passions of our pity and our awe.” You may say at once,
and literally of nearly all tragic writers, “that they have
sought in crimes their materials, and in criminals their
heroes.”
Mr. Burke has probably in much accounted for this
somber selection of character and subject, in those re-
marks, not the least subtle and profound, in his memorable
treatise, wherein he demonstrates that, as power is a source
of the sublime, so power, to be sublime, must be suggestive
of terror, and associated with attributes of destruction.
“Whatever,” he says, “is fitted in any sort to excite
the ideas of pain or danger—that is to say, whatever is in
any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or
operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of
the sublime.”f
Again, “that power derives all its sublimity from the
terror with which it is generally accompanied, will appear
* Nothing can be more unsatisfactory than all definitions which
have sought to limit the author's liberty of selection from criminal
agencies and instruments. “The only circumstance,” says one
critic, “which elevates the crime into a subject for the poet or the
dramatist, is the influence under which it is committed, the object
which it is to attain, the nature of the impelling necessities which
lead to it,--when these spring from causes not base or ignoble in
themselves, when they come, for instance, from a combination of
wrong not otherwise to be redressed, murder becomes a poetic
subject; it is that which is dignified as a ‘tragedy’ and distin-
guished from mere felony.” Words, signifying nothing! The
crimes of Ingo are base and ignoble in themselves—they come
from “no combination of wrong not otherwise to be redressed;”
neither do those of Richard III., nor those of Phaedra, of Clytem-
nestra, of the daughters of Lear, and the mother of Hamlet, and
the wife of Macbeth.

evidently, from its effect in the very few cases in which it
may be possible to strip a considerable degree of strength
of its power to hurt, when you do this, you spoil it of
everything sublime, and it immediately becomes contempt-
ible.” He proceeds to compare the ox, strong but inno-
cent, and therefore the idea of which is not grand, with the
bull, which, precisely because its strength is often destruc-
tive, has frequently a place in sublime description. “We
have continually about us animals of a strength that is
considerable, but not pernicious; among these we never
look for the sublime. It comes upon us in the gloomy
forest and in the howling wilderness—in the forms of the
lion, the tiger, the panther, or rhinoceros.”
Without absolutely going to the extreme of the princi-
ple this eminent thinker has enforced, or asserting that
strength, to be sublime, must be necessarily pernicious,
it is undeniable at least, that the association of power with
destruction is one of the most obvious sources of the
sublime. And, as guilt in Man, when accompanied with
intellect or daring, contains a power infinitely exceeding
the brute force of the mere animal, so crime is the cus-
tomary material for tragic art, and furnishes the tremen-
dous instrument for moving the human heart by the agency
of terror.
Other reasons might be adduced to show why crime has
been made an essential element on the stage;—how it has
afforded to the master of human nature his amplest scope
for investigating the most subtle and hidden recesses of
character and passion, unraveling the skein of intellectual
error, and holding up to a thoughtless world those strik-
ing and solemn warnings in which the more direct morality
of tragic composition may be said to consist. Perhaps the

old Greek Platonist who eloquently defended Homer from
the accusations of his master, has made some remarks on
this part of our subject not unworthy of attention.
“It appears to me,” he says, “that whatever is tragical,
monstrous, and out of the common course of nature in
poetical fictions, excites the hearers in all imaginable ways
to the investigation of the truth, attracts us to recondite
knowledge, and does not suffer us through apparent prob-
ability to rest satisfied with superficial conceptions, but
compels us to penetrate into the interior parts of fables, to
explore the obscure intention of their authors,” etc.
Enough, then, has been said to show that crime is an
admitted and necessary element of tragic fiction, an agency
employed by the greatest poets, and to be vindicated by
the plainest principles of their art; and so popularly is
this understood, that the very statue of the Tragic Muse
is represented with the dagger in one hand, the poison
bowl in the other.
But then it is implied, if not openly contended, that,
though the presentation of crime is allowable on the stage,
it is to be condemned in a novel. Much is said about the
“weak minds of circulating library readers”—“the young”
and “impressionable,” etc. As if there were no weak minds
in the pit and the gallery of Drury Lane—as if only sages
and stoics were to be found in the boxes—as if a dramatic
audience were not, upon the whole, a far more miscellane-
ous class than that of subscribers to a circulating library,

however, the liberty of substituting for the word “unnatural,” the
paraphrase “out of the common course of nature,” which is cer-
tainly the true meaning of Proclus.

of relation or expression. And since, whatever our varie-

writer for the stage. Pause to consider how moral terror in
tragic composition is obtained. The more you examine, the
more you will find that moral” terror is never excited except
by images of evil or punishment—by some destroying or
dangerous agency. Look a little deeper, and you will
find that there are only two kinds of this agency—the first,
supernatural, such as Fate, a ghost, a witch, a fiend, an
oracle, etc., in which the images from another world are
summoned to exercise evil influence over this; the second
agency is human crime. Search, I say, all tragedies, all
fictions, and you will find that moral terror is never pro-
duced, but by some evil or destroying power, and that
that power is never to be found, except in the two agencies
I have named, viz., the supernatural or the criminal. Grant,
then, what you cannot deny, that the narrator is in the ex-
ercise of his undoubted right, to attempt, if he can, to create
the passion of terror, and you are compelled to grant him
the only means by which he can effect his object, viz., the
supernatural or the criminal. This is so evident a truth,
that it would be unnecessary to say a word further on the
subject, if it were not that the public are less familiarized
to representations of guilt in the narrative fiction, than
they are in the dramatic; and hence the comparative un-
familiarity has given a readier reception to shallow criti-
cism of the romance, than common sense and daily custom
would permit to be applied to the drama. But this only
proves what is undeniable, viz., that the tragic prose ro-
mance is of very recent date in literature, and has hitherto
been sparingly cultivated. I believe that Richardson's

“Clarissa Harlowe” was the first prose fiction, attaining
permanent celebrity, that resorted for interest to the ele-
ments of tragedy. I need not say, that the plot of that
work is founded on the progress and perpetration of a
crime equally odious and base, conducted through scenes,
abetted by characters, and consummated by means which
the public would probably not permit to a writer in the
present day. Yet, of Richardson, our great moralist could
say with truth “that he taught the passions to move at
the command of Virtue.” The next tragic fiction that
won fame from the public was the “Julia de Roubigné”
of the gentle-hearted Mackenzie. It closes in murder and
suicide; and those who would fly at higher game than the
living, may find, perhaps, something to say against the
dead great author, who holds up as the ideal of chivalrous
honor—high, though erring—the jealous assassin, who
poisons his wife, and escapes by self-slaughter the penal-
ties and shame of his deed. Yet who, among the true
judges of literature, would deny to Mackenzie the praise
he deserves as a writer of the purest intentions and the
mildest humanity? Not long after this, with some tragic
purpose (though I do not include it among the fictions
that we recognize as critically tragic), came the “Zeluco”
of Moore—the gloomy portrait of a hero whom no moral
sentiment ennobles, no genial impulse ever warms—but
justifying the author by his aim to show in the maturer
life of his hero the errors of early education, and the ab-
sorbing debasement of cultivated egotism. Nor has any
man ventured to deny, that Dr. Moore in his writings has
deserved the reputation for virtuous purpose, which, more
than his genius, obtained him the favor of the public.
To these succeeded the truly tragic fiction of Godwin's
“Caleb Williams,” in which, as in “Julia de Roubigné,” a
murderer is made the hero, with false honor for his tempter,

while his remorse and his terror supply both analysis and
incident. Yet, whatever may be said of Mr. Godwin's
speculative opinions, on political and other subjects, all
will admit that his aims were those of a philosopher, who
sought, in his own way, the inculcation of morals. And
while his more erroneous expositions of doctrine have
sunk into oblivion, “Caleb Williams” lives yet, and will,
perhaps, live while our language lasts, as a monument of
genius on which are graven admonitions to error.
Thus it will be perceived that in all the classic tragic
prose fictions preceding our own age, criminals have afforded
the prominent characters, and crime the essential material.
Since the production of those works, prose fiction has
yet more extended its ancient limits.” It has entered with
Goethe the domains of speculative thought; it has been
enlarged to almost boundless extent by the energies of
Scott. But while that last named and illustrious writer
enriched the realms he had won with the stores of the
historian, and from the mines of the poet—while, in mere
form, more than any one, he relieved and animated the
progress of narrative, and the delineation of character with
the dialogue and action of the stage, of tragic fiction,
rigidly so called, he has left but one signal master-piece,
“The Bride of Lammermoor.”f In this, to create his

belong precisely to either. We cannot justly call “Wilhelm Meister”
or “Anastasius,” “Undine” or “Picciola,” “Atala” or “René,”
“Caleb Williams’” and “Julia de Roubigné,” either novels or ro-
mances. In England the word fiction has thus crept into use, for
want of one less general and vague.

troduced, he rather resorted to the old Greek instrumen-

I shall state hereafter) he could not have continued to em-

suffices to show that Scott's power in the sterner narrative

still to the adventurer whom those regions invite, it is
permitted to add—

may be destined, amid the comparative neglect of the stage,
to supply the lessons which the tragic drama has, for
awhile, abandoned. Do not fetter its wanderings from
free search after truth through the mazes of society, and
amid all the contrasts of nature. If it is to be a voice to
the heart, an interpreter of the secrets of life, you cannot
withhold from it the broadest experience of the struggle
between good and evil, happiness and woe.

that all which is effected of terror is produced by the agency of
guilt; in fact, wherever Walter Scott has produced terror without
employing supernatural means, it will always and unavoidably, from
the causes stated in the text, be found in connection with crime.

But I am told, somewhat more definitely and precisely,
that though crimes of a lofty order, rendered high and
solemn by ancient tradition, and clad in the pomp of history,
are fitting subjects for fiction, the crimes which occur in
our own day and finish their career at the gallows or the
hulks, are wholly to be banished from recital. “Such
things may be: leave them to their own ignominy. Why
elevate vulgar felons into heroes, and take us for interest
to the Old Bailey?”
This, I believe, is a correct quotation from the kind of
censure with which (stripped of its grosser personalities) I
have had to contend. Once for all, I will seek to answer it as
seriously as if it were an argument, not a declamation; a
friendly remonstrance, not a hostile and heated assault
And while replying to my assailants in the Press, I ad-
dress calmly and respectfully my argument to those on
whom attacks so frequently and passionately urged may
have produced an impression which it pains me most deeply
to think any work of mine should create on one honorable
and impartial mind.
I have already, I trust, shown that the charge of habitu-
ally selecting criminals for my themes is in itself untrue.
I proceed now to the question, how far the crimes of our
own days, the crimes of Tyburn and the Old Bailey, may
be admissible to the license of art in fiction, and conducive
to the moral it should inculcate.
I will grant at once that, for the purposes of poetry,
high tragic effect may be more readily produced, and may
usually create a grander or less distressful sentiment of
awe, when it is sought in the ancient treasure-house of
history or fable; and in some of my works I have rever-
ently drawn from such elder and remoter sources. But
one region of art does not exclude the other. The past
cannot monopolize the sorrows and crimes of ages. While

we live, we ourselves become a past. And we are un-
questionably warranted to consult the Book of Time, in
the page which is spread before our eyes. Can we do so
faithfully if we strike out all passages that pain or perplex
us? Can we give any fair idea of the record, if we con-
fine all our extracts to what we instinctively approve and
readily comprehend? No, every one concedes to me at
once, that a writer is at liberty to search amid the ma-
terials afforded to him in modern life for the subjects and
characters of fiction. The comic writer takes fearlessly
whatever in the errors and vices of mankind adapts itself
to the comic result of exciting our ridicule and moving
our contempt:
“Licet, semperque licebit
dicere de vitiis.”*
“It ever has been, and ever will be, lawful to speak of the
vices,” which it is the province of Comedy as of Satire to
expose. The Tartuffe of Molière, the Blifil of Fielding,
the Squire Thornhill of Goldsmith (a scoundrel, perhaps
the vilest and the most sparingly punished in comic fiction),
the whole spirit in Le Sage, the whole object in Swift, are
uniformly directed to the exposure of the meaner and more
vicious propensities of men. Folly and error, vice pun-
ished by ridicule, constitute the main materials of the comic
writer, whether he employ them in a drama or a novel.
Must we not grant to the writer who seeks for the elements
of tragedy that exist in his own time, the equal license to
seek for the materials to which tragedy must apply? What
are those materials but the passions and the crimes of men,
—as, for comedy, the materials are drawn from the humors
and the vices? Terror and compassion are the sources of

the tragic writer's effects; the destructive or pernicious
power of intellect corrupted into guilt, affords him the
natural means of creating terror for the evil, and compas-
sion for its victims. To say that the criminals he is thus
compelled to employ as the agents of his plot are unfit
for his purpose because they may be classed among the
prey of Newgate and the Old Bailey, is but to lay down
the preposterous principle, that we must not extract trag-
edy from times in which laws are carried into effect; it is
simply to say, that, because men in our day are trans-
ported and hanged for guilt, the guilt of our day it is im-
proper to analyze and depict. All crimes now, if detected,
must obtain the notoriety of the Old Bailey, or reap their
desert in Newgate; and to contend that Newgate and the
Old Bailey unfit them for the uses of the writer of fiction,
is virtually to deprive him of the use of all crimes punished
by modern law and enacted in the modern day: as if there
were no warning to be drawn from sins that are not en-
nobled by ermine and purple; as if there were no terror
in the condemned cell, no tragedy at the foot of the gal-
lows! And yet how hackneyed is the aphorism, that the
human heart, and the tragedy to be drawn from it, remain
the same in every agel Unless, then, we deny altogether
that we are to seek for the sources of tragedy amid the
times which we must necessarily know the best, among the
characters on which the broadest and steadiest light can
be cast, amid the warnings the most immediately useful to
us, we cannot reject to the writer of modern fiction the
materials of modern tragedy, even though they are drawn
from the records of the prison-house and the judgments
of the law. The materials must be open to choice, with
certain stipulations as to the treatment, into which we shall
enter later.

most thoughtfully bent upon the alliance between humanity
and art, that we have too much neglected the deeper and
graver characteristics of our own age; too much contented
ourselves with surveys of the surface, delineations of man-
ners, fashions, and foibles, and turned to the past for that
sterner poetry which is not less sensibly to be found in the
sorrows and the guilt of the life around us. Thus, toward
the close of his life, Schiller, whom, at that time, no man
can accuse of rash and unconsidered tamperings with the
legitimate end of genius, meditated a drama that would
seem least poetical to the shallow, but was intended to
extract poetry from the very sources which it seems we are
now forbidden to explore. His proposed subject was “The
French Police;” and I need not say that the conception
could not fail to comprehend the evils, the abuses, and the
crimes of modern civilization.
Good men there are, no doubt, who would interdict
altogether the presentation of actual crime, as painful and
revolting—as administering to a passion for diseased ex-
citement; I respect their scruples. But, without here
pausing to examine what weight can be attached to them,
is the prohibition even possible 7 Crime meets us as a fact
everywhere; you cannot open a newspaper, you cannot
refer to statistics, you cannot mix in the ordinary world—
but crime is forced daily and hourly on your notice. You
must close up for purity and youth all history, sacred and
profane; you must shut out from the calendar of life the
tyrant and the martyr; you must seal up the fountains of
literature, and silence the long succession of poets from
Sophocles to Dante, from Dante to Shakspeare, from
Shakspeare to the last song that has thrilled through the
world—if you seek to exclude from the mind the dark
certainties of guilt. Even then you will fail. Man has
but to live, to know that crime is the foe man must brave.

Could you instruct him what he should resist and abhor, if
you could leave him ignorant of its existence and its chas-
tisement? You cannot, like the Emperor of China, live in
a fancied succession of triumphs and security, and receive
congratulations on the felicity of your reign and the impreg-
nability of your dominion, while the enemy are blockading
your ports and sailing up your rivers. The essential char-
acteristic of this age and land is publicity. There exists
a Press, which bares at once to the universal eye every ex-
ample of guilt that comes before a legal tribunal. In
these very newspapers which would forbid a romance
writer to depict crime with all that he can suggest to
demonstrate its causes, portray its hideousness, insist on
its inevitable doom,-are everywhere to be found the mi-
nutest details of guilt,-the meanest secrets of the prison-
house are explored, turnkeys interrogated, and pages filled .
with descriptions of the personal appearance of the felon,
his dress at the bar, his courage at the gallows. To find
the true literature of Newgate and Tyburn, you have only
to open the newspaper on your table. That reports thus
sent abroad to all quarters of a motley civilization, read
aloud in the lowest alehouse and in the vilest resorts of
outcasts and thieves—the only literary food (as newspa-
pers are) of the most uneducated classes;—that such may
do harm, I am ready to confess, and this from the careless
tone and the base detail—the obtrusion of a criminal noto-
riety unaccompanied by a single lesson—gorging the curi-
osity and familiarizing away the solemnity of guilt.* But
* This is the necessity of the newspaper press, rather than a re-
proach to it. That press but obeys the imperious demands for
publicity which the age enforces. Its business is to deal with
facts; and it can only partially and briefly convey the deductions
which the author of a fiction writes volumes to explain.

how different this from the narrative of a writer of fiction,
who presents no single portraiture of crime to monopolize
the morbid fancy—who contrasts it with images of purity
and innocence—who analyzes the workings of the heart,
and thus checks its progress to corruption—who accom-
panies the crime, as by its shadow, with the darkness of
its own deformity—who exerts all the power he possesses
to accumulate terrors round its consequences and chastise-
ments—whose work by its literary treatment (if the author
possess but ordinary scholarship), to say nothing of its
mode of publication, is not destined to penetrate, like the
newspaper, among the most ignorant and perverted—the
accomplices and imitators of the guilty — but is almost
necessarily confined to classes of a certain education, which
would render the imitation as untempting as the guilt itself
is abhorrent. The fiction supplies the very lessons the
newspaper cannot give. If the reader doubt this, let him
only compare the impressions made upon his mind by a
crime brought before the courts of law with those pro-
duced by a crime which some imaginative writer has de-
picted;—I am greatly mistaken if he does not own at once
that the last are infinitely more grave, more forcible, and
more enduring.
Analysis of the darker or coarser crimes of society is
not intended to reform the criminals—them it does not
reach. It is not as a curb to tyrants that “William
Tell” is effective. It is not to reform an Appius that we
express our sympathy with Virginius. It is not to breathe
virtue into burglars that “Jonathan Wild” was composed,
or to prevent men from poisoning their wives, that Mac-
kenzie wrote his “Julia de Roubigné.” Limited, indeed,
would be the moral uses of fiction, if confined to the pecu-
liar idiosyncrasies of character it selects. Nor is it only by
the catastrophe itself that fiction reaches the heart, but yet

more by the mental dissection which it admits, that it cor.
rects our errors in developing their causes. It is by the
tendencies to which terror or compassion in the tragic
form, ridicule and contempt in the comic, are the agents
that we confirm social enthusiasm for virtue, and unite the
reason with the passions in detestation of crime. And all
this can be equally effected, whether we resort for materials
to the past or to the present, to the vices of the great or
to those of the mean. It is the treatment that ennobles,
not the subject. Grant that the characters are what con-
vention calls low—in birth, station, instruction; born in a
cellar, dying on the gibbet, they are not one jot, for those
reasons, made necessarily low to art. Art can, with Field-
ing, weave an epic from adventures with gamekeepers and
barbers. Art can, with Goethe, convert into poetry the
most lofty, the homely image of the girl condemned for
infanticide, and confine the vast war between spirits and
men to the floors of her felon cell. Rightly has the most
majestic of poets placed at the Portals of Dread, not those
fiends which are tempters of the great and deluders of the
wise, but rather the demons of the ruder multitude, “Fear,
and ill-advising Hunger, Labor, and shameful Want”—
“Et Metus, es malesuada Fames, et turpis Egestas;
Terribiles visu formae—Letumque, Laborque.”
To sum up, I think, then, we must allow :
1st. That crime, however great and heinous, is an ad-
mitted and necessary agency in tragic fiction, warranted
by the employment of the greatest masters, and the sanc-
tion of all ages.
2dly. That it is equally admissible in the narrative fic-
tion as the dramatic.

3dly. That we may seek for the materials of terror in
crime, or destructive power, amid the present as the past
—that we are limited neither to particular periods nor
conventional gradations of rank—that wherever we find
the facts that furnish the passion of terror,” and the char-
acters that permit the analysis of motive to conduct (the
cause to the effect)—we are at full liberty to use them.
I said that we have a right to demand certain stipula-
tions as to treatment and selection.
1stly. We have a right to demand that, whatever interest
the author bids us take in the criminal, we should never,
by any metaphysical sophistry, be seduced into admiration
of the crime—that even where, as usually in the drama,
the "criminal is invested with attributes that enforce re-
spect, or is induced to an offense at war with his general
character by circumstance and temptation—still the crime
itself should be shown clearly as a violation of eternal laws,
and be condemned, not only by the result in the fiction, but
the reason of the beholder. We are not forbidden to sym-
pathize with Othello in his jealousy, nor to admire the
nobleness which contrasts an infirmity ordinarily mean and
egotistical; for we see that the crime to which it urges
him entails its own direful punishment, and no compassion
for the murderer lessens our horror of the murder.
2dly. The crimes depicted should not be of a nature to
lead us through licentious scenes, nor accompanied with
descriptions that appeal dangerously to the senses. There
is one class of evil which shocks and revolts us—there is
another class of evil to which the most perilous ally is in

our nature. There is nothing to corrupt us in the delinea.
tion of murder and violent wrong; our instincts recoil at
once from the idea of imitation. There may be much to
corrupt us in the delineation of an adulterous love, though
the moral it is meant to convey may, in itself, be excellent.
And, therefore, it is safest not to make prominent or mi-
nutely to detail crimes of a nature which less openly revolts
us than insidiously allures.*
3dly. In dealing especially with the coarser and more
violent crimes least idealized by remote tradition, least
dignified by history above vulgar associations, the author
is bound to have some object in view belonging to the
purer and more thoughtful principles of art, to which the
means he employs are subordinate and conducive. If in
“Jonathan Wild” Fielding takes us almost solely among
thieves and pickpockets, it is not merely, and objectively,
as it were, to familiarize us with their principles and habits.
In describing the actual meanness, he is aiming his satire
at false greatness. It is not because a man is a felon and
a criminal that therefore he furnishes a fitting theme for
the drama or the narrative. I guard myself especially
against appearing to sanction so preposterous a conclusion.
But if there be anything so peculiar in his guilt, or the
circumstances attending it, as to afford fair scope for artistic
purpose, suggest useful reflections, or inculcate a salutary
lesson, then it is, not because he is a criminal or felon,
* And this principle of treatment, be it observed, holds as good
in the delineation of virtue as in the exhibition of guilt. “Pamela,”
for instance, is intended to celebrate the triumph of virtue in a
woman,—“Caleb Williams” depicts the guilty fall of a man. Yet
which of the two fictions would a father prefer to trust to his
children: The design of Richardson is eminently virtuous, but,
by an error in art, the treatment obtrudes scenes and suggests
ideas of very questionable safety.

that he becomes an unfit instrument for those ends to
which, indeed (as we have seen), the agency of crime is
essential. If, therefore, the author make use of the actual
and more violent guilt that forms one element of the so-
ciety around us—we have a right to expect that it will be
introduced, not in wanton levity, but for some thoughtful
purpose—tending (to the best of his judgment) to illustrate
some serviceable truth.
These, I believe, are the main restrictions which we must
impose upon the liberty of the author, in granting him all
the privileged resources of his art.
I venture to assert, that by these restrictions I have
been bound. Throwing myself on the indulgence of the
candid for an egotism rendered necessary by the direct
personality of the attacks, and without which the reader
must be sensible that these remarks would be desultory
and incomplete; and assuming merely, that the three
works I am called upon to defend have been read by those
to whom I address myself, I proceed to challenge for them
the severest application the impartial can bestow, of the
rules I have laid down for the proprieties of treatment.
And first, as to “Paul Clifford.” The object of “Paul
Clifford” ought to be sufficiently apparent. It was written
at a time when capital punishment was still in this country
indiscriminately impolitic and severe—when society was
not employed, as it is virtuously now, in seeking to reform
the circumstances which engender crime in the masses; but
was content with punishing by severity the offenses it had
in much caused by neglect. To quote from the short pre-
face to the edition of 1840, it was my design, therefore,
* The real hero of this book is perhaps rather William Brandon
than his son; but I take the responsibility created by the title
selected.

“to draw attention to two errors in our penal institutions,
viz., a vicious prison discipline, and a sanguinary criminal
code—the habit of first corrupting the boy by the very
punishment that ought to redeem him, and then hanging
the man on the first occasion, as the easiest way of getting
rid of our own blunders;” it was “a satire on the short
cut established between the house of correction and the
condemned cell.”
Paul Clifford himself is thus represented as one of the
very numerous class to which all practical philanthropists
are now inviting our attention; exposed in boyhood to
the contagion of evil companionship—sent to prison for
an offense he does not commit—escaping from it by the
dexterity of one of those confirmed rogues with whom a
prison brings him into familiar association—and after-
ward, almost necessarily driven for a livelihood into de-
fiance of the Law, which had already expelled him from
its pale. Paul Clifford offends, and he is punished—he is
an exile forever from his country; but as his offense is ex-
tenuated by circumstances—as society in itself is in some
measure a partaker of it—as some good qualities, that
show him capable of reform, belong to his character, and
as he has been led into none of the darker crimes of cruelty,
revenge, and bloodshed—so he is not punished to the ex-
tent of the gallows. He is allowed to work out his re-
demption by repentance and atonement. In all this, the
novelist does but second the improved disposition of society
itself. He does but advocate in a fiction the principles
which are now enlightening our journals and ameliorating
our laws.
To guard against danger of imitation by the modern
invaders of property (if such a book could ever reach
them), Paul Clifford is not represented—as certain parties
zhoose unblushingly to assert—as a mere pickpocket and

thief—he is taken out of the range of existing subjects for
the Old Bailey. His offense is that of the obsolete, and
now impossible nature, which characterized what was sa-
tirically called the “Gentleman Highwayman;” and has
passed away from our well-regulated roads and inclosed
commons as entirely as the band of Robin Hood has passed
from the glades of Sherwood. It can now be imitated no
more than adventurous youth can imitate the Locksley
and the Rob Roy of Walter Scott. And with quite as
much justice in the last cited novel may its great and
healthful author be accused of exalting a robber into a
hero, and weaving round him a dangerous and immoral
interest, as the humbler writer, now put upon his defense,
of such a design in the moonlight rides of Paul Clifford
the Highwayman.* If exception be taken to the mere
lowness of scenes and characters occasionally introduced
in the book, but by no means forming the principal part
of it, I may observe, that as they contain nothing obscene
or licentious, nothing to incite or inflame, and are not in-
troduced for themselves, but for satire upon the real vul-
garity often found beneath the mere conventional polish
they travesty or burlesque, so whatever may be said
against such an introduction on the score of art, it is free,
at least, from all tendency to corrupt. And in this, since
I cannot claim the merit of originality, I have at least the
sanction of authorities the most respected—not only in the

* Rob Roy defies the law, plunders the traveler, ravages the
border, spares not life, if in his way, and is represented on the
whole as an amiable and gallant character, and dismissed without
punishment, to the doubtful approbation of the reader. In all this
the assailers of “Paul Clifford” see nothing to call for the charge
of raising robbers into heroes, or bestowing interest upon criminals.
And they are right. Let them be but consistent. If this miserable
jargon is to be employed at all, let them use it impartially.

ford” to the acquittal of any impartial jury upon the
capital charges that, without evidence and against pre-
cedent, have been laid to its charge.
In “Eugene Aram” the case was wholly different, de-
manding graver treatment and more awful chastisement;
here, at least, there was no vulgar offender, nor here was
there any victim to the errors and neglect of society. Here
was one of those startling phenomena in human conduct
which had arrested the attention of the historian, claimed
the muse of the poet, which had been more than the nine
days' wonder in the age in which it had occurred, and re-
mained in the record and memories of men, as containing
the problems, and exciting the terror, of a completed
tragedy in itself. The picture of a laborious and self-
taught student, apparently of a life the most blameless,
a character the most humane, locking within his con-
science the secret of a dark and inexplicable crime, not
to be explained by intelligible motives—attributed to what
seemed essentially opposite to his nature and pursuits (viz.
the mean desire of gain)—brought to light after many
years, by a series of circumstances regular and coherent
as the links in a drama, is surely not to be classed amid
the vulgar and commonplace offenses of Newgate records;
and if ever crime be admissible in fiction, I confess that I
know of few within that wide history in which it finds its
place more set apart and marked out for tragic analysis

and delineation. Not in the various subjects it has been
my fortune to select, though they have dealt with larger
and more complicated interests of mankind; not in Pliny's
fearful account of the flaming mountain and buried city;
not in the failing attempt of Rienzi to resuscitate the corpse
of Roman grandeur, recorded in the annals of Italy; not
in the wild and gloomy struggle in which our own chroni.
clers have tracked, amid the Wars of the Roses, the san-
guinary transition from the feudal to the social age, can I
recognize a theme more adapted to Tragic purposes than
the image of that solitary mind, silent and bowed down
beneath the weight of its solitary crime. I was not singular
in my belief that this subject was appropriate to the pur-
poses to which I presumed to apply it. Mr. Godwin
assured me that he had often meditated a fiction, of which
Eugene Aram was to be the hero; and I am informed by
a high and indisputable authority,” that Sir Walter Scott
expressed his surprise that a crime so peculiarly adapted
to tragedy or romance, had been so long untreated by
either.
I venture, then, to assume that the choice of my subject
was sufficiently legitimate. And I addressed myself to its
execution with an earnest study neither to palliate the of.
fense nor diminish the terror of the chastisement. Here,
unlike the milder guilt of Paul Cifford, the author was not
to imply reform to society, nor open in this world atone-
ment and pardon to the criminal. As it would have been
wholly in vain to disguise, by mean tamperings with art
and truth, the ordinary habits of life and attributes of char-
acter, which all record and remembrance ascribed to Eu-
gene Aram—as it would have defeated every end of the
moral inculcated by his guilt, to portray in the caricature

of the murderer of melodrame, a man immersed in study,
of whom it was noted that he turned aside from the worm
in his path,”—so I have allowed to him whatever contrasts
with his inexpiable crime have been recorded on sufficient
authority. But I have invariably taken care that the crime
itself should stand stripped of every sophistry, and be
hideous to the perpetrator as well as to the world. Al-
lowing all by which attention to his biography may explain
the tremendous paradox of fearful guilt in a man aspiring
after knowledge and not generally inhumane—allowing that
the crime came upon him in the partial insanity produced
by the combining circumstances of a brain overwrought
by intense study, disturbed by an excited imagination, and
the fumes of a momentary disease of the reasoning faculty,
consumed by the desire of knowledge, unwholesome and
morbid, because coveted as an end, not a means, added to
the other physical causes of mental aberration—to be found
in loneliness, and want verging upon famine; all these
which a biographer may suppose to have conspired to his
crime, have never been used by the novelist as excuses for
its enormity, nor indeed, lest they should seem as excuses,
have they ever been clearly presented to the view. The
moral consisted in showing more than the mere legal pun-
ishment at the close. It was to show how the conscious-
ness of the deed was to exclude whatever humanity of
character preceded and belied it from all active exercise—
all social confidence; how the knowledge of the bar be-
tween the minds of others and his own, deprived the crim-
inal of all motive to ambition, and blighted knowledge of

I come now to the last of the three works of which I
have undertaken the defense. But before I speak of the
object really intended in the romance of “Lucretia,” I
must clear up a very signal and general mistake on the
part of my critics. In the preface to “Lucretia,” it will
be observed that I speak much of an intention I had long
entertained of depicting the influences of money upon
modern civilization, and exposing what I held as a vice of
the day, in impatience or dislike to the slow returns of
legitimate toil, whether in pecuniary speculation or intel-
lectual ambition. And upon this, with the exception of
two or three reviewers, there has been an outcry of simul-
taneous discovery that the design announced in the preface
was not borne out in the execution of the book; and ac-
cordingly that the book was a failure, because the author
had not accurately defined what the book was intended to
convey. If these gentlemen will do me the favor to cor-
rect in themselves that “impatience” which I took the
liberty to denounce, and look with a little less haste at
that unfortunate preface, they will, perhaps, convince them-
selves that I never professed “Lucretia” to be the fulfill-
ment or carrying out of the purpose which I said I had
once meditated in an earlier design. What I stated, I.

imagined that an attempt to illustrate the influeuces of

noney might be best worked out upon the stage; that
that design, with which I wished to couple some exposi-
tion of the popular vice of impatience, I afterward thought
I could best treat in a novel; but that while meditating
such a conce, tion, I became acquainted with the lives of
two criminals, so remarkable as to engage my examination
and analysis; and, that this second design had supplanted
the first, I thought I had made abundantly clear by the
following rema ks: -
“I could not resist the temptation of reducing to a tale
the materials (viz., the lives and letters of the said two
criminals) which had so engrossed my interest and tasked
my inquiries; aud, in this attempt, various incidental
opportunities have occurred, if not of completely carrying
out, still of incidentally illustrating my earlier design.”
And, a few lines farther, I expressly observe, “that the
delineation of the darker crime formed the staple of my
narrative,” proceeding to remark, that in that delineation
“the less obvious moral must be found in those uses to
which poets have applied the portraiture of gigantic
crime.” -
Therefore, any impartial person will perceive at once,
that even at the commencement of my book its object has
been, to say the least, carelessly misrepresented;—that
what made the purpose of an earlier and suspended de-
sign, only furnished incidental illustration to the present
—and that that illustration was the less noticeable in the
agencies of the greater crime which formed the staple of
the narrative, and in which another moral must necessarily
be sought.
“The incidental opportunities” to which I limited my
engagement, occur chiefly in the minor agents of the fic-
tion. William Mainwaring with a competent fortune, and
abilities calculated, with steady perseverance, to gratify

ambition by an honorable repute, finds his tempter in the
undue desire of gain, and the rash impatience for distine -
tion. Without these enemies in his own breast, Lucretis
had been powerless against him. On the other hand,
Walter Ardworth, represented as honest in his impulse
and generous in his sympathies, loses character for want
of due regard to the prudence in preserving, which is the
counter error to greed in acquiring; and too impatient,
even in the social and generous tendencies which attach
him to liberty as the advancement of his species, to study
the application of theory to practice, sinks into a shallow
declaimer, as useless to his cause, as unprofitable to him-
self. In contrast to both these, meant to unite the talents
of the one with the sympathies of the other, is sketched
in outline the character of John Ardworth–energetic, but
not rash—uncovetous, but self-denying—valuing money at
its just standard, and looking to steadfast labor as the
surest means of success. Incidentally (if only incidentally)
the secret and sinister influences of money upon conduct
are also suggested in the mechanical avarice of Beck—
the habitual degradation of Grabman—incidentally they
even apply to the career of the two arch criminals them-
selves—covetousness and impatience are twin elements in
the grasping, hollow character of the scoundrel Warney,
“alieni appetens, sui profusus,” with the cold heart of the
miser—the rank lusts of the spendthrift. Impatience to
attain to the end, which her selfish love for Mainwaring
suggests, is the first cause of those criminal desires in Lu-
cretia, which are the germs of her criminal deeds, and by
which she first permits herself to encourage the contem-
plation of a human life as an obstacle in her way. And
with all her constitutional indifference to money in itself,
so much is money mixed up with men's fellest, as their
noblest designs, that it is for the coveted inheritance of

her son, for the power money can bestow, that her crown-
ing and most hideous guilt is principally conceived and
accomplished. If it be said that these are not the patent
and obvious influences of money, I reply that, even in my
earlier design, such indirect influences were not those which
I stated it to be my intention to depict. . The broad char-
acteristics, whether of a Harpagon, a Beverley, or an Heir
of Lynn, have been sufficiently portrayed. I spoke em-
phatically of a former design to trace rather “the strange
and secret ways in which that arch civilizer, familiarly
called money, insinuates itself into our thoughts and
motives, our hearts and actions.” But all I professed in
this work, was to take advantage of incidental oppor-
tunities of suggesting such lessons—and I have now shown
that I have fulfilled my intention to the extent of my en-
gagement.
The deeper, sterner, and more tragical design to be
found in the crimes that form the staple of the narrative,
I did not detail in my preface, partly because I trusted it
might be sufficiently obvious to the more intelligent reader,
partly because it could not have been explained without
impertinently forestalling the plot, and could not well have
been understood till the volumes were closed and the mind
could look back upon the whole. I was mistaken, it seems,
in my first reason for silence, and I have no longer the
motive for the second. Here let me pause for a moment,
and endeavor to remove from the mind of the reader the
principal obstacle, I apprehend, in the way of his candid
judgment. *
Colley Cibber tells us, in his amusing autobiography,
that in his time actors did not like to represent the parts
of villains, “lest in some sort they should be confounded
with the persons represented,” and, indeed, that the audi-

ence themselves “were shy of giving applause to Iago, lest
they should be looked on as abettors of the wickedness in
view.” Nay, “the Master of the Revels, who then licensed
plays for the stage, would strike out whole scenes, where a
vicious and immoral character was introduced, however
visibly it were shown that it was to be afterward punished
or reformed.” Once, much to poor Colley's dismay, this
wise Master of the Revels struck out the whole of the first
act of Richard III., “without leaving a line of it.” In
vain was the prayer, “for a speech or two, that the other
four acts might limp on with a little less absurdity.” The
Master of the Revels was obdurate, “and so the play was
positively acted for some years without the first act at all!”
Now something, perhaps, of this prejudice still exists in
the public; when the author has presented some character
of villainy to their eyes, perhaps they are still shy of their
applause, “lest they be looked upon as abettors of the
wickedness described.” Nay, perhaps the more life-like
and truthful the villainy, the greater the dread of being
entrapped into owning the faithful colors of the author,
and the easier, by some artful foe in the house, they may
be led into venting on the writer some part of the resent-
ment which he designedly raised against his creations.
This is like beheading Dr. Guillotine by the very machine
he intended, out of the least truculent motives, for the
more artistic decapitation of felons. I must entreat, how-
ever, the reader to lay aside that prejudice which, however
amiable, is certainly unjust, and dissociate entirely the idea
of what is due to the author from the sense of what is due
to the characters whom the author has purposely submitted
to abhorrence. He does not the less hate the crimes, be-
cause he has sought, in presenting, to deduce from them
what warnings they may convey: and he, is about now
more clearly to explain what moral, perhaps not unprofit-

able, may come, clear and fair, from the guilt it has shocked
the good to behold.
When the chief materials for the gloomier part of this
tale were submitted to me, in the lives, writings, and cor-
respondence of the two persons represented under the
names of Lucretia and Warney, that which made upon me
the deepest and most startling impression was the degree
of intellectual cultivation which accompanied and height-
ened their ineffable guilt. We are so accustomed to con-
sider crime the hideous offspring of ignorance, that when
we find it accompanied by much literary instruction, it
startles the wonder of the indifferent, and rouses the in-
quiry of those who love to explore the workings of the
human mind.
The person whose guilt is certainly not exaggerated in
Warney, was an artist, a musician, a critic, and a writer of
liveliness and versatility. In his correspondence, he ap-
pears to have skimmed the surface of a large and various
reading—speaks familiarly of Kant, and hints at a trans-
lation of Schelling. In the correspondence of the original
from whom is drawn the Lucretia of the fiction, are appar-
ent a cultivation more elaborate, and faculties more for-
midable. These were facts not to be got over. Some lesson,
like all facts, they must convey. And I searched för that
lesson as a physician may watch some fearful disease, so
rare indeed in itself, that his deductions might never be
applied to one precisely similar, but which, if comprehended
and detailed, might add to the general stores of pathology,
and unravel some of the more mysterious complications of
the human frame. It is ever painful to believe in the
union of mental cultivation with cruel propensities or
moral depravity; still, the fact of such a union rises out
from every page in the varying chronicles of history.
Sometimes the most ruthless exterminator is found in one

who has armed himself against his kind with all the learn-
ing of his age; and the accomplishments of a woman have
been interwoven with the ferocities of a savage. The
most sanguinary tyrant of ancient Greece so cultivated
the reasoning faculties he perverted, as to induce the pop-
ular error to class him among the sages: Nero had stored
his cruel and sensual mind with the very accomplishments
supposed most to humanize and soften ; everything that
his time could teach him, refined into system the atrocities
of Caesar Borgia; Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, surpassed
the most ruthless in an age of barbarity; yet “with his
head,” say the chroniclers, “fell half the scholarship of
England;” Richard III. brought to the fierce, unlettered
struggles of his day the arts of Italy and the learning of
Utrecht. Happily, the moral to be drawn from these
colossal criminals is, the utter failure of the very intellect
so perverted and misused. And as, whatever our inclina-
tion to the contrary, we cannot deny that in private indi-
viduals the same discordant and dismal union of cultivated
intellect and corrupted conscience does sometimes, though
rarely, exist, let us deduce from biography and fiction
the same salutary truth that consoles us in history. His-
tory makes clear the fact and loud the warning. Is it
wrong for fiction, that history of the inner heart, to do the
same 7 . To show the nothingness and impotence of intel-
lect, even in the attainment of its own intellectual aims,
when it once admits crime as its agency—to show how
useless, nay, pernicious, to the guilty possessor is the very
mental power he thus desecrates and perverts—to show
that goodness and genial affection are essential to the
triumph and fruitfulness of all that mind may plot for, and
force would command—for these lessons, it might be as
permissible to dive into the guilt of Lucretia as into that
of the Prince of Valentinois—and expose in the humbler

the same alliance of the sensual and the cruel, the effem-
inate and unsparing, which may startle us in the imperial
poisoner and parricide of old. It is only “the property-
man” of the stage that sees grandeur but in the crown or
the toga. Strip off the externals. We have a right to
:ompare men with men.
I wished, then, to show the fate of intelligence abused
tº the ends of guilt. Somewhat of this had already been
shadowed out, as I have said, in the tale of “Eugene
Aram.” I sought now to follow the inquiry it suggested
into wider tracks, and into yet more comprehensive results.
With two out of the three great divisions of human intel-
ligence, facts supplied me; I drew from invention for the
third.
In Dalibard, the intention was to portray the wary, cal-
culating, and laborious intellect, which, rightly directed,
leads to science; in Warney, the versatile, lively, impres-
sionable fancy, which, purified and guided, may conduct to
art; in Lucretia, the energy and active will, which, nobly
stimulated and trained, may lead to eminence and success
in the outward concerns of life.
All these intellects had but to be honest to succeed.
Each of these intellects divorces itself early from all in-
terests but its own. Each works and plots solely for objects
identified with itself. Each admits crime for its agency;
and from that moment all three, so essentially distinct, are
merged in one common infamy and degradation—from
that moment every effort of the intellect itself becomes a
failure; and time and justice, and the truth of things,
crush them beneath the Alps they themselves have created.
In the minutiae of treatment, all ground for such mischief,
as the most cautious might apprehend, in instructing de-
pravity (if depravity such a book should ever reach), as to

the materials at its command, has been so studiously
avoided, that the reader will perceive the uniform care
with which the possible attainment of those materials
have been placed out of the reach of the guilty; the tem-
porary success that attends the poisons employed by the
murderers is made to depend solely on their selection of
no drug to be procured by commonplace villainy—in the
secrets of chemical compounds, which at no shop could be
purchased, of which no hint is conveyed, except that only
by chemistry, the most erudite and skillful, they can pos-
sibly be combined. Rather than incur, however innocently,
the possibility of supplying to one “morbid idiosyncrasy.”
the agencies at the service of these modern Borgias, I
have willingly invited the much more plausible accusation
of far-fetched and impracticable devices, if ever existing,
wholly lost to the invention, wholly out of the command,
of guilt in the age in which we live.
I said in my preface that the originals from whom I had
drawn had as little as imagination can conceive to redeem
their guilt. And this, I trust, I have sternly kept in view.
I have never once held them up to compassion. I have
left them that degree of ability which was justified by
facts; not elevated into the genius, with which, as in his.
tory, we find such criminality is not accompanied. It has
been even reproached to me, that I have not given them
genius, and that all their cunning, instruction, or audacity
-avails them not for worldly success. Why, that was pre-
cisely one truth that I aimed at 1 The Borgias and the
Richards fall short of genius, but have ability sufficient to

Pressed into the service of Death, Mind itself grows grim
and hateful as the king that it serves.
“Black it stands as Night,
Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell,
And shakes a deadly dart!”
These Children of Night, by the paths they themselves
have chosen, are conducted to catastrophes, which, while
punishing them the most in the sin each had most favored,
was that which each (could the soul have foreseen it)
would have regarded as the most fearful and appalling.
Dalibard, the coward and the calculator, shrinking from
all physical danger, and using his holiest relationships but
as tools to his purpose, is betrayed at the hearth he had
desecrated, and butchered by the dull ruffian he had duped.
Warney, who had prostituted the perfection of his physical
senses to their vilest gratifications, luxurious amid his
infamy, effeminate in despite of his animal audacity, is
sentenced to the coarsest of hardships, the vilest of labor,
chained to the most loathsome of malefactors, doomed to
all that the senses, most pampered, would shudder from
the most, all that the fancy, so perverted, could body forth
of horror and despair. Lucretia, who had made on earth
no god but the intellect, is cursed in the intellect—
smitten down below the brutes, but with the conscious-
ness of the mortal—retaining, amid the ruins of all the
past, only the image of her crime, standing face to face
with it as a visible thing. Surely these punishments are
as appalling and as appropriate to the guilt as poetic
justice can 'ommand 1 And beside them the gibbet is
mercy and reprieve.

contemplation of guilt in itself, it was but undertaken for
an honest and serious purpose. And a thoughtful reader
will perceive, that even the more subordinate images of
evil introduced were in accordance with one earnest and
elaborate design. The dull and villainous brutality of the
grave-stealer, for instance, forms no superfluous figure on
the gloomy canvas, nor, in chaining that sordid ruffian to
the more pampered miscreant, is the idea of befitting pun-
ishment to the last alone enforced. But in confounding
in one lowest abyss of human degradation the man in
whom no nobler faculty has ever been awakened, and the
man to whom all faculties sufficing for the perception of
good have been given, and by whom they have been vol-
untarily perverted to odious and execrable ends, it was
sought to convey a truth, suggestive of no unprofitable
reflections.
That wise man, Dr. Slop, in discussing Yorick's Sermon,
contends that the Roman Catholic Sermons “have greatly
the advantage, that they never introduce any character
below a patriarch, or a patriarch's wife, or a martyr, or a
saint. ‘There are some very bad characters in this, how-
ever,” said my father, “and I do not think the sermon is a
jot the worse for ‘em.”
Perhaps Mr. Shandy in this was a better judge than Dr.
Slop.
I contend, then, and I think that I have proved, that
the design of this book of the “Children of Night,” was
conformable to the laws of fiction and the truths of history;
that the moral it enforces is serious and impressive, not
the less for the pain it bequeaths; that it can but deepen
the horror of guilt, and the dread of its consequences;
that it can but preach wholesome lessons to the intellect,
and awaken lively self-examination in the heart; and that
there is not a single attempt to create for the criminals

I have been told, indeed, that, though these dark social
phenomena may exist, they are too peculiar, too rare, for
moral or artistical treatment. Perhaps such critics would
never have made the charge had they been aware of the
compliment it implies. Every man really a critic in art,
knows that rare truths are more important than frequent
ones. “The teaching of Nature,” says one who has
thoroughly mastered the subject he treats of, “is as varied
and infinite as it is constant, and the duty of the painter is
to watch for every one of her lessons, and to give (for
human life can admit of nothing more) those in which she
has manifested each of her principles in the most striking
and peculiar way. The rarer his phenomena, the more
valuable his works will be.” Not, indeed, that we must
delineate the rare alone. “Both the frequent and the rare
are parts of the same great system; to give either exclu-
sively is imperfect truth.” If these “Children of Night.”

an author are not to be judged by one work alone, so I
may venture to invite those who have really read me, to
add to the contrast of the gloom and guilt depicted in
“Lucretia,” whatever of gentler fancies they may remem-
ber in the “Pilgrims of the Rhine,” of attempts to sym-
bolize the beauty of art in the romance of “Zanoni,” or to
embody the steadfast virtue of practical life in the Mor-
daunt of “The Disowned.” And if they will permit their
thoughts to wander for a moment through the whole range
of my writings, they will own at least that, whatever their
faults, they are not to be accused of sameness in the char-
acters, nor of monotony in treatment.
“Lucretia,” I confess to be a painful book; all delinea-
tion of fearful crime, and the ruin it entails, must necessarily
be so. If, in its treatment, I have overstepped the true
limits of terror, that may be an error in art, but not one
(be it remembered and distinguished) in moral tendency
and design.”
There is this distinction between the old tragedy and
the new. With the Greek, Fate was the main instrument
of woe and crime;—so with the Greek, there was little
need of mental analysis—little need to show from what
errors of his own, man suffered and sinned. Fate stalked
across his way or stood upon his hearth—his fell and
irresistible foe. An oracle declared he should murder, a
god led his steps to his doom. But with us, guilt or woe
has its source in ourselves. Our conscience is our oracle,
our deeds shape our fate. And though, in a few rare in-
stances, modern writers have still had recourse to the iron
deity of old, it is obvious that unless the instrumentality

of a power which we cannot influence and control be most
sparingly and cautiously employed, we should seem to sanc-
tion the dangerous principle that we are the passive and
unconscious tools, not the active and reasoning contrivers,
of the evil that conducts us to the abyss. Hence arises
the imperious necessity, for those who resort to the sources
of tragedy, and trace from them the channels of woe or
guilt—to search narrowly and patiently (often, it may be,
with distaste to themselves) into all that is dark and hidden
in the mechanism of the mind for the causes of evil, and
the links between the thought and the sin. And thus in
proportion to the crime they depict, and the destruction it
effects, must be the gloom of the impression they create,
and the degree of pain they inflict. If, in the narrative of
these “Children of Night,”—if, as some assert, “its horror
is burlesque,” and its treatment “excites rather ridicule
than awe,”—if, as I am assured by others, it is “dullness
upon dullness,” “nothing graphic in the picture,” “nothing
striking in the incidents,”—then, though its moral cannot
be pernicious, I have certainly failed to render it instruc-
tive. But if it bequeaths (as the facts on which it is founded
should enable it to do) the effect of tragedy thoroughly in
earnest—a sensation of terror that oppresses the more from
the conviction that reality lies beneath the fiction—a relief
in the heartfelt detestation of the crime from which the
terror proceeds—a dread of “the destructive power” which
is the essence of the hateful combination between intellect
and guilt, and a desire to rush for escape to the cheerful
atmosphere of good, then does this book come, at least,
within the allotted limits of the art that is built upon terror,
and sanctions its connection with pain and distress,” and

then does it attain to those moral effects which are pro-
duced by the means of the passions.
The moral conveyed in all works of the imagination is
in part distinct and immediate, in part also it is untracea-
ble, distant, and indirect. And this latter part is perhaps
the most really valuable and efficient. Ask any thoughtful
and educated man, what works have produced the most
marked and recognized influence on his conduct, and I
believe he will never name a fiction or a poem. Next, and
unspeakably subordinate, to the more sacred monitors whose
counsel he reverently obeys—he will tell us, perhaps, of some
homely treatise, or some artless biography. But ask that
man to dissociate from the general influences on his con-
duct, whatever he may have learned from the pages of
poetry and fiction, and he will doubtless tell you it is im-
possible. He will acknowledge how much, yet how insensi-
bly, they have strengthened his moral impressions—how
much they have suggested reflections that brighten his per-
ceptions of truths—how much they have added to that gen-
eral knowledge of the heart which has set emotion on its
guard, and animated into generous passion his love for the
tion is made, but simply to show that, in the judgment of a very
eminent critic, art finds in distress one ingredient of the sublime;
and though of course an effect is not sublime because it is distress-
ing, yet at least it is not an offense to art that the sensation of dis-
tress is occasioned. Though a writer may make no pretense to the
sublime, he may still apply for such effects as his degree of power
permits him to produce to whatever are suggested as its sources.
“Of feeling, little more can be said, than that the idea of bodily
pain in all the modes and degrees of labor, pain, anguish, torment,
is productive of the sublime, and nothing else in this sense can
produce it.”—“Its strongest emotion (that of the sublime) is an
emotion of distress, and no pleasure from a positive cause belongs
to it.”—BURKE On the Sublime and Beautiful, Part ii. sect. 22

noble and the good—his scorn for the sordid and the evil.
And this it is, I presume, that some writer intended to ex-
press when he finely asked, “Who among us now living
can tell what he would have been if Shakspeare had never
existed 7”
None of my readers will ever, I know, have to resist one
temptation to a villainy a millionth part so hateful as that
described in “Lucretia” as a monstrous phenomenon. But
in the struggles of life, the minor seductions of evil are
often repelled by the lively horror derived from the doom
which poet or tale-teller has assigned to concessions to the
greater. If this were not so, the gigantic and unfamiliar
crimes depicted on the heroic stage would be but idle
exaggerations. Who among the audience that listen to
“Macbeth” will have to wade through blood to a throne,
yet who may not have some selfish object his ambition
would promote, and be tempted by the meaner “juggles
of the fiend?” In the picture of a crime dwells the warn-
ing to an error. Divers and specious are the allurements
to attain to ends coveted by the intellect, through means
more or less disapproved by the conscience: and not un-
salutary may be the true lesson to be derived from “Lu-
cretia” if the impressions it bequeaths, though vague and
unanalyzed, serve to quicken the instantaneous conviction
that all which defiles the conscience defeats and defrauds
the intellect.
“The first step passed, compels us on to more,
And guilt proves fate, which was but choice before.”
A task reluctantly undertaken is now fulfilled. I have
shown that it is uncharitable and rash to decide in haste
against the moral purposes of writers who have no object
to deprave—I have shown the laws and examples which

render justifiable in fiction the delineations of crime—I
have exposed the falsity of the charge so reiterated against
myself, that habitually, and by preference, I have made
criminals my heroes—I have shown that, out of sixteen
fictions, to three only can this charge be applied. I have,
I trust, made it manifest, that each of these three will bear
the test of the strictest reference to the due restrictions
to be placed upon their treatment and design; that no
sophistry has been employed to vindicate the crime; that
the crime has not been of that nature in which the narra-
tive needs, or has found, inflammatory appeals to the more
tempting passions—obtruding the presentation of licentious
images, and clothing itself in a garb which rather allures
than revolts; and, finally, I trust I have made it clear to
the reader, that such stern and somber subjects have not
been undertaken without the befitting gravity of thoughtful
and earnest purpose.
If I have not entered at length into the subjects of my
other works, it is because such self-criticism would have
been unpardonable, unless for the imperative necessities of
self-defense—each singly considered, their moral tendencies
and objects have been tacitly admitted, or only vaguely
assailed; and the reader will acknowledge, that in mainly
confining myself to those works in which criminals have
been made the predominant characters, I have fairly and
honestly met the gravamen of the charge that has been
urged against me. The rest of my writings, therefore, I
confidently leave to the recollections of the general reader;
and though, among works so numerous, commenced at so
early an age, and comprehending delineations of life, with
its manners and its passions, so widely various, there may
occur, unavoidably, some errors of judgment, some pas-
sages too lightly considered—(and what writer could bear

a malignant research through more than forty volumes,
made with a design of interpreting every sentence to the
worst?)—yet I am convinced that the result of any candid
survey would establish the fact that all those works were
conceived with the heartfelt desire to minister, however
humbly, to truth and good, and executed with a reverent
care to unsettle no man's mind as to the clear principles of
religion—or the broad distinctions which the conscience
has established between what we should aspire to and
what we should avoid.
This vindication, which, I think, has been conducted in
that fair spirit of dispassionate argument which I prescribed

TRADE MARKS REGISTRATION ACT, 1875.—
RYLANDS. BROTHERS (Limited).—Piracy of Trade Mark.—
It has come to the knowledge of this Company that their Trade
Mark, which has been duly registered in accordance with the pro¬
visions of the Trade Marks Registration Act, 1875, has been pirated,
and that shipments of wire of inferior quaiity, with such pirated
Trade Mark, and consequently purporting to be the manufacture of
the Company, have been made to Australia and New Zealand, where
the Company's goods, guaranteed by their said Trade Mark, are in
high repute and command a corresponding market and price. The
PIRACY of their TRADE MARK being an injury to the credit, as
well as a pecuniary loss to the Company, this is to give notice that
proceedings will be taken against all parties concerned in such piracy,
or found shipping or dealing in any way with goods bearing such
pirated Trade Mark.

I am the Lonson Agent of Rylands, Brothers (Limited), of War¬

The wire manufactured by the said Company is protected by a

Trade Marks Registration Act, 1875.
It is within my knowledge that the Trade Mark of the said Com¬
pany has been and is pirated, and that wire of an inferior quality to
that manufactured by the Company has been shipped to the Colonies
with pirated Trade Marks, and purporting to be the manufacture of
the said Company.
And I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the
same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an Act made and
passed in the Session of Parlament of the fifth and sixth years of the
reign of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled "An
Aet to repeal an Act of the present session of Parliament, intituled
an Act for the more effectual abolition of Oaths and Affirmations
taken and made in various departments of the State, and to substi¬
tute Deciarations in lieu thereof, and for the more entire suppression

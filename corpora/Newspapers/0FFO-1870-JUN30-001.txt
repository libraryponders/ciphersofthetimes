IN the MATTER of NICOLL v. MAURY, heard
May 26. 1870, before his Honour Vice-Chancellor James, a per¬
petual INJUNCTION was granted against the defendant, restraining
him trom making or selling or causing to be made or sold, certain
garments patented by the plaintiff, and ommonly known under the
trade mark of RUG PALETOTS, and from making or selling any
colourable imitation thereof, or from using the trade mark so claimed
by the plaintiff.
"London, June 16th, 1870.
"Gentlemen.— I deeply regret having caused you the trouble to de.
fend your patent rights and to institute legal proceedings against me¬
in compliance with the injunction which you have recently obtained
my solicitors, Messrs. Plews and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed
to pay your costs. 1 have also directed an account to be prepared of
all consignments I have made to the colonies up to the date of the
injuuction. Tuese will, as speedily as possible, be farnished to you, as
well as a statement of all rug paletots that have been made by me in
contravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest should be determined by some London or colonial
merchaut to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question.
"I hope that you will do me the justice to believe that previons to the
commencement of litigation betweenus, I sincercly thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact condiguration descrited in your speci¬
pcation and drawing attached to the patent. I, therefore, did not
imagine that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counsel
claimed it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such. I
now understand, consists in the formation of material into a garment,
and in the manner set forth, with an adapbation for its use, so that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have orred in the knowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of damages, I have no
objection to your publishing this letter.

interest in the foreshore of the river to oppose the invasion of their
rights, of which notice had been given by the Board of Trade, have the
satisfaction of reporting to their constituents, and others who are
interested in the foreshore, that their exertions have been successful.
They represented the case fully to the Board of Trade, and urged them
not to interfere with their rights, and they presented a memorial to
the Council of the Prince of Wales (the owner of a considerable part of
the southern shore in Lambeth), and had an interview with one of the
council, and they called the attention of other public bodies who are the
owners of other parts of the shore to the proposed measure ; and they
now find, from the Bill just brought into the House of Commons by
the Board of Trade, that the project of interfering with the rights over
the foreshore is abandoned, and there is in the Bill a clause preserving
the exemptions which are contained in the former Act, one of which
is an exemption in favour of the rights of all owners and occupiers of

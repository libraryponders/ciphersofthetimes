Charles, son roi," at the Camp, A—t.
MISSING, since Thursday, the 16th of March, an
ELDERLY GENTLEMAN, 70 years of age (looks not quite as
old), 5ft, 5in, in height, stoops, is a thin spare figure, has a florid com¬
plexion, small grayish whiskers, light brown hair intermingled with
gray, and blue eyes; was dressed in a long black coat, black trousers,
blucher boots (square toed, clumsily made), and high black hat with
mourning band. Was last seen at a barber's shop in Salisbury, Wilts,
where he had his moustachios shaved off, having passed the provious
night at the Shoulder of Mutton Inn, at the same place. Information
to be given to Mr. Pollaky, Private Inquiry-office, 13, Paddington-¬
green, London, W.
AT Marshall and Snelgrove's door in Vere-street,
on Thursday last, about 4 o'clock, two ladies, on entering their
carriage, were asked to favour the applicant with the name of a gen¬
tleman of the family, with whom he could communicate, having been
grossly insulded by the coachman, who had, with an oath, refused that
information, and, violently backing his carriage on the horses of another
in the rear, then dashed off to prevent an answer being obtained. If
either his master or mistress would wish to know and to check the
insolence of the coachman (not only to the advertiser but to themselves),
they will be good enough to apply to Mr. Elgood, 98, Wimpole-street.

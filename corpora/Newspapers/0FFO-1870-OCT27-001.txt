IN the CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT.—Regina,
on the Prosecution of Arthur Bower Forwood, v. Colneljus
Walford.—Referring to the indictments herein charging me, the under¬
signed, with writing and publishing a false and defamatony libel of and
concerning the prosecutor and Mr. James Russell Ross. I hereby
undertake on the trial thereof to plead guilty to having written and
published the said libel. As to my knowledge of the falsity of the said
libel, I state that it was written on the spur of the moment from in¬
formation communicated to me and forthwith despatched to the
printer; that upon reflection, when I saw the libel in print, I felt that
aoie e e p atsions therein contained of and concirning the said proseon¬
tor and James Russell Koss were wholly unjuatifiable and devoid of
truth; and I desire to express unreservedly my deep regret for having
written and published the said LIBEL, and to ofter a complete and
public APOLOGY therefore. And I agree to the foregoing being
published as the prosecuter may desire.—E

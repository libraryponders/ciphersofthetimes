W. R. Sutton, as proprietor of Mann's Parcel Despatch, and published
in The Times lately, has no relation whatever to their general shipping
and commission agency at 101, Leadenhall-street; and the letter, being
inserted in the same publication with a shipping advertisement from
another firm, tends to mislead the public and do us considerable
injury.

NOTICE.—Mr. WATHERSTON (late of Henrietta¬

to discontinue the legal proceedings which you have directed your
solicitor to commence against me, in consequence of my having un¬

APOLOGIZE for having thus transgressed the law, which shall be a
lesson for me in future ; and, at the same time, I beg to hand over to
you all the patterns and castings in my possession, and to consent to
your publishing this letter in any way you may think proper. I need
scarcely say, that I shall always feel grateful for the leniency you have
shownme, and I undertake to pay all costs you have incurred in the
matter, as well as those conseonent upon advertising this apology.—

workmen remain at the old premises. He takes this opportunity of

CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements appear daily, stating that the
advertisers can reproduce cartes de visite portraits, I, CAMILLE
SILVY (as far as I am concerned) CAUTION all persons against such
proceedings, which infringe the acts for protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to
secure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number); and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

DEAR OLD HICKORY.—Mitre-court has not
forgotten you all this long time. Write to Kittums.
HO.—I do, with all my soul. How I long to tell you,
and ask forgiveness for my mistake. I was so grieved when I
found it out. You said, "Don't send until," &c., but I could wait no
longer, and was writing when your most welcome present came,
Thank you, my own true heart. No, nothing serious; we are good
friends. No; I had not the most remote idea of it. I shall be in my
home, too, on that day, but it must be so far from here. No. I
understoed so well what came with it. Heaven bless you, and make
you my happy Q. Yours in all things, LOYAL. All well now.

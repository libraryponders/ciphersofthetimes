awakened to the advantage of this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to pass off clumsy
imitations for that winen D. Nicoll and Co. have already proved
to be the cheapest articse ever offered to the public. The safeguard
will be the rigirt to demand to see the trade mark, which may be thus
described: the Coats of Arms of London and Pans are printed or
woven on to a loop used for hanging up the garment, and between
these emblems of the two cities, the wordese
Nicoll's Patent" appear.

of the recipe of a Macassar oil, with other recipes of a similar cha¬
racter, for a few postage stamps; while others proiess to manufacture
the real 0) article at a considerably reduced price, if the public wilt
only purchase it. The name of these wretched countericiters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the teilet."

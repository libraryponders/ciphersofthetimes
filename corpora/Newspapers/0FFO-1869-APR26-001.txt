petroleum, and have not been licensed by the Board, that it is neces¬
sary forthwith to apply at the offices of the Board, Spring-gardens, for
a LICENSE under these Statutes.
Petroleum, as defined by law, includes benzoline and mineral
naphtha, and also benzine, benzine-collas, and any other product of
petroleum, and any paraffin or other mineral oils giving off an infiam¬
mable vapour when heated under 100 degrees. Dealers in such goods
must therefore obtain licenses and conform to such conditions as to
storage and sale during daylight as will render their operations safe to
themselves and the public.
The Inspectors on behalf of the Board will examine into every case
and report thereon. Heavy penalties and the forfeiture of the articles
so illegally kept are incurred by the non-observance of the Petroleum
Acts.
By order, JOHN POLLARD, Clerk of the Board.

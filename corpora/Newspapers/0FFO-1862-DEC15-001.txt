"T the ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of the
Inhabitants of Finsbury-circus, held at the Castle Tavern, Moor¬
gate-street, on Wednesday, December 10, the Rev. JOSIAH PRATT
in the chair, the following resolutions were carried unanimously:—
That, in the opinion of this meeting, the destruction of Finsbury-¬
circus for the purposes of a railroad would inflict unnecessary and irre¬
parable injury upon the inhabitants, by taking away the only residences
in an open situation which now remain in the city of London, and that
the Directors be requested to oppose the projected scheme.
That, considering the overcrowded character of the metropolis, and
the absence of vegetation over an extensive territory, every garden and
other open space is of vital importance to the community, the Directors
are requested to prepare a petition to both Houses of Parlament to
preclude for ever by Legislative enactment such gardens and open
spaces in the metropolis from being destroyed for railroads or any other
purpose whatsoever.
That the injury inflicted upon individuals in London from projectors
seeking to form railroads at various places, without reference to any
Loesseemssamgaman
other companies may co-operate with them, is so great that further
emendniteseggemeemguthsamss
are requested to petition Her Majesty's Government to appoint a com¬
mission to settle the locality of such general lines as may be necessary

That the construction of railroad stations in proximity to Finsbury¬
circus, beyond those already autherized, will concentrate the traffic so
as to render the adjoining streets in the city more impassable than they

That the Directors be requested to advertise these resolutions, and to
ask the aid of the Corporation of London, the Members for the city,

THE LONDON LOCKMAKERS in the INTER¬
NATIONAL EXHIBITION.—Messrs. HOBBS and Co. beg to
inform bankers and the commercial world, that their PATENT LOCK
in the Exhibition was on challenge from the 1st of May to the 1st of
November, for 300 guineas to any person who could pick it. This was
the only lock exhibited that invited and dared the ingenuity of the
mechanician to fraudulently open it. Seven days were allowed to
examine the interior, and 30 days to operate on the security of the
works; yet, during the 158 days the Exhibition was actually open, not
one single application was made. In 1851 this lock was tried for 123
days without the slightest approach towards success. Messrs. Hobbs

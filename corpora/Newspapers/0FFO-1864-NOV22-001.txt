CAUTION.—MENIER's CHOCOLATE (Chocolat¬
Menier).—Important Notice.—To avoid being deceived by resem¬
blance in the form of the cakes, colour of the covering, arrangement of
the label, and that quasi-similarity of names which imitators have in¬
vented for the purpose of passing off their chocolate as the Chocolat¬
Menier, the purchasers should look for the trade marks, the real name
upon the back of each division of the cake, and the signature Menier
upon the seal of the cover. Imitators try especially the fine quaiity
(yellow paper) at the price marked 2s. per pound, because it is this thet
the public have particularly adopted; it gives the highest satisfaction
both for its low price and its excellent quality. Wholesale Menier,

EREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An

SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 129, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionabee system of compuisory hall-marking, is (l) un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recagnize 1 principles of modern fscal legisiation; (4: contrary to the
established laws of politicaljeconomy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political econqmists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the preas of the Untted Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

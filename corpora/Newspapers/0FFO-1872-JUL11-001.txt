Wotherspoon v. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indisputably esta¬
blished, wouid also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penalty of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
been induced to buy it, that to save them from toral loss we will
allow 20s, per ewt, for it at the Gienfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the cursent price. This will
entail a los upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken wo and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deceptien. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.
CAUTION.—£1,000.—Whereas it has come to my
knowledge that since the publication of my book, "A Sincere

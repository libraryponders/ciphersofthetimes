R. JAMES PEDDIE, 1, Hanover-street, Edin¬

nature from a country correspondent. This LETTER having been mis¬

B. L. D.—Thank you for the distinet assurance that
the words in question were not intended in the sense imputed to
them. Your son was certainly the last person to attack the reputation
of one who had so recently been his intimate friend. Poor fellow! all
his coolness to me (so contrary to his wonted custom) is now ex¬
plained. This will serve to undeceive any who may have been gulled.
really or colourably, directly or indirectly. I am without a particle of
responsibility in the Pig-dog affair.—P. P.—F. W.

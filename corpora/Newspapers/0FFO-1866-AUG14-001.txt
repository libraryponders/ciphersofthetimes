GUNMAKERS' COMPANY of LONDON.—
PROOF of BARRELS, under "The Gunbarrel Proof Act. 1855,
—Whereas, immediately after the passing of the above Act, the Master
Wardens and Assistants of the Company of Gunmakers of London
drew the attention of the gun trade and the public generally to its pro¬
visions, and particularly to the rules and conditions precedent to proof
appended thereto, and there being afterwards reason to know that
many rifles in the hands of members of some of the volunteer brigades
had not been submitted to the test required by the Act, the Gun¬
makers' Company, on the 6th of January, 1860, addressed a letter on
the subject to the officers in command of all the volunteer brigades in
England and Wales, earnestly recommending an immediate inspection
of the arms of their several brigades, in order to ascertain if the same
had been duly proved, and in any cases of barrels found without any
proof marks, or with marks of a doubtful nature, if such barrels were
forwarded to the Proofmaster of the Company, Church-lane, White¬
chapel, London, that such barrels would be at once gratuitously in¬
spected, and the result communicated to the senders thereof ; of which
offer the commanding officers of many of the volunteer brigades availed
themselves, and the Gunmakers' Company now refers to the circum¬
stance for the purpose of repeating the offer then made to the officers
in command of the volunteer rifle regiments throughout England and
Wales; and whereas there is reason to fear, notwithstanding the means
adopted, and the convictions obtained against individuals for infringe¬
ments of the said Gunbarrel Proof Act, that many guns continue to be
sold and purchased, the barrels of which have never been exposed to
the test required by the following sections of the said Act, viz.:—
Section 87. "After the commencement of this Act, a barrel shall not
be used in the making of any small arm, unless the barrel have been
duly proved at the proof-house of the Gunmakers' Company, or at the
Birmingham proof-house, or at some other public proof-house esta¬
blished by law, and duly marked as proved. Section 88, "After the
commencement of this Act a small arm shall not be sold or exchanged,
xposed, or kept for sale, or exported, unless the barel or barels
thereof have been duly proved at the proof-house of the Gunmakers'
Company, the Birmingham proof-house, or some other public
proof-house established by law, and duly marked as proved."
Section 91. "Any barrel marked as proved, if the mark of such proof
be at any time removed or altered, or so defaced as not to be distinguish
able, shall for the purpose of this Act be deemed an unproved barrel."
By section 100, No. 1, the penal consequences for committing any of
the above offences are £20 for every such barrel. Section 99. "Every
person who forges or counterfeits any stamp, or any part of any stamp.
already or hereafter provided or used by either of the two Companies
for the marking of any barrel, shall for every such offence be guilty of a
misdemeanour, and shall at the discretion of the Court be sentenced to
imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for not more than three
years. All persons are therefore again seriously cautioned against
selling or purchasing any guns or pistols the barrels of which have not
been duly proved at one of the said proof-houses as mentioned in the

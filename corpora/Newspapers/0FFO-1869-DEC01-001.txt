CAUTION.—The NOURISHING STOUT.—Trade
Label.—The public are cautioned against receiving any as genuine
which does not bear upon each cask and bottle the registered trade
mark, as follows:—"Nourithing Loneon Stout," between two red

street, St. James's," as well as the letters "R. above B," in red; and
acress the label, in white letters upon a red band, "Analyzed and Re¬

tern is ever ture, it shouid never be drunk unless properly filtered,
and the latest and best system of so doing is that—requiring no atten¬
tion on the part of servants and others—introduced by the LONDON
and GENERAL WATER PURIFYING COMPANY (Limited),
No. 157, Strand (four doors from Somerset-house), where the process
can be viewed and full particulars obtained. Read "Water, its Im¬

plicity and portability have been observed, coupied with the utmost
secrecy and consequent security to the contents. It is hre-proof; and,
in discarding the hitherto shapened receptacles for the several articles

injury.-Howell, James, and Co., Regent-street, Pall-ma

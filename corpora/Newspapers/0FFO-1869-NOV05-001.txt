racter, for a few postage stamps; while others prefess to manufacture
the real ( article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
 purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the tollet."

As the boundaries laid down on the Government Maps were pointed
out to the Ordnance Surveyors by Meresmen, or persons appointed by
lier Majesty's Justices of the l'race assembled in Quarter Sersions, as
directed by the Acts of Parliament quoted above, the maps may pos¬
aibly become evidence respecting the boundaries, and thus aflect the
right of rating lands. Therefore proprietors, agents, and other persons
to whom this Notice is addressed, are particularly requested to ox¬
amine the Sketch Maps, to ascertain that the boundurles of those lands
in and for which they are interested have been correctly defined and
laid down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for compa¬
rison with the Boundary Sketch Maps, that, should any differences be
found, they may be inquired into, and corrected before the maps are

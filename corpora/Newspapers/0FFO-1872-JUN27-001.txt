INOLEUM.—Caution.—The LINOLEUM MANU¬

against certain inferior manufactures, which are now being offered in
the name of their celebrated Linoleum Floor Cloth, and have-to state
that none is genuine unless stamped at intervals on the back with the
trade mark, and the words "F. Waiton's Patents.
CAUTION.—Water Filters.—The LONDON and
GENERAL WATER PURIFYING COMPANY caution the
public that all its FILTERS have the Company's name on them, and
no others are genuine. It is also very essential that all letters should
have the aumber of their depot in the Strand, to prevent mistakes and
disappointment, as numerous letters have miscarried when the number
has been omitted. For prices, &c., apply or address to 157, Strand, W. C.
CAUTION.—In calling the attention of the trade
to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
"Wotherspoos v. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indisputably esta¬
blithed, would also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penalty of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
been induced to buy it, that to save them from total loss we will
allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entail a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deception.
ne information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

FIRE at the PANTECHNICON.—The Earl of

men. The SAFE I purchased of you, which was in the disastrons fire
that occurred at the Pantecinicon last February, and was only diseo¬
vared in July, has been found in such a satisfactory state that, al¬
though from the fact that there was nothing deposited in it the test
could not be complere, I am satisfied it would have afforded proper
security. Notwithstanding that the brass work was melted and the
safe had fallen a considerable distance on to some hard substance, its
condition was all that could be desired, presenting a remarkable con¬
trast to other safes that have been found. I am, gentlemen, yours

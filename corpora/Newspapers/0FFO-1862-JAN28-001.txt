FIVE THOUSAND THALERS REWARD.—
Whereas, WILLIAM REICHENOW Messenger at the Royal
Prussian Bank at Dulsseldorf, having on the 3d of July, 1861, robbed
the said Bank of the sum of 100,000 thalers in Prussian Bank notes, of
50 thalers each, besides some other money, did then and there take to
flight, and whereas after the most diligent search the whereabouts of
the said William Reichenow have not hitherto been discovered; now
therefore do we herewith admonish all whom it may concern to search
for traces of the said William Reichenow and of the moneys purloined
by the same, and, in case of such being found, to send their informa¬
tion forthwith to His Prussian Majesty's Procurator General, Herr
von Ammon, at Dilsseldorf, Rhenish-Prussia. And whoever shall
procure the arrest of the said William Reichenow, or the recovery of
the money purloined by him, shall receive a reward of 5,000 thalers in
Prussian currency for the recovery of the whole, or a proportionate
reward for the recovery of any portion of the said sum of 100,000
thalers. A considerable reward is also hereby offered to any one who
shall furnish information which even indirectly shall lead to the
arrest of the said William Reichenow. The said William Reichenow
is about 40 years of age, of middle height, rather short than tall, he is
a broad-chested, thin faced man, of sallow complexion and brown,
short-cut hair, he has a soldier's step and bearing, and at the time of
his flight he had long mustachios and whiskers, while his chin was
shaved. The presumption is that he has since cut his mustachios and
whiskers. Of languages he knows German only, which he talks in the
Berlin dialect. His handwriting is tolerably correct and fiuent.

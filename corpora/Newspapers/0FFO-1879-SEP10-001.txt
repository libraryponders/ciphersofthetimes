MARY HUGHES (formerly MARY UPTON), late
of Wyndham-road, St. George's, Camberwell, Surrey, who died
June or July, 1857.—The said Mary Hughes was entitled during her
life to part of an annuity of £50 a year given by the will of William
Upton deceased. An action has been brought in the Chancery Divi¬
sion of the High Court of Justice by Mrs. Foster, claiming the capital
of the fund out of which the said annuity has been paid: If the said
Mary Hughes did any act in her lifetime to sever the jolnt tenancy
between herself and the other annuitants as to such annuity, the said
Mary Hughes's children are probably entitled to one-third of the said
capital fund. The CHILDREN of the said MARY HUGHES and
her husband, if living, are requested to COMMUNICATE, imme¬
diately, with Mr. R. Barnes (who has been appointed to represent
the estate of the said Mary Hughes in the said action), to enable the
said R. Barnes to support the claim (if any) of the children of the
said Mary Hughes to such one-third of the said capital fund.
Answers to this advertisement are to be sent to Mr. Barnes's Solici¬
tors, Messrs. Burgoynes, Milnes, Burgoyne, and Thrupp, Solicitors,

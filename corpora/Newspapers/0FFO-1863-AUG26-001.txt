ON CHLORATE of POTASSA, and its USE

n OXYDIZING the BLOOD.—Mr. J. P. SARGEANT.
M.R.C.S. and L.S.A. (1836), will shortly LECTURE on this subject at
St. James's-hall, Piccadilly, and will satisfactorily prove that chlorate
of potassa (as prepared by passing clorine through a mixture of quick¬
lime and water, and subsequently boiling a long time with chloride of
potassium) is a most active remedy for oxydizing the blood, and restor¬
ing vitality to the low, vitiated state of the nervous system, and is
therefore calculated to supersede the use of iron, mercury, quinine, and
sarsaparilla.—56, Gower-street, Bedford-square.

as aforesaid is drawn to the provisions of the said Act next follow¬

Every person claiming land within ithe Provincial District of Wel¬
lington under any Land forder originasly issued by the New Zealand

henua Districts, must, within 12 months from the 30th Nevember, 1277.
if he be a resigent in the Colony, and within two years from such date
it he be a resident e sewhere, give notice in writing, by himsent or his
agent, to the Commissioner appointed for the District of Wellington
under the fordinance of the Lezisiative Council of the Islands of New
Zea and, Session 15, No. 11, for the hearing and decision of his claim
under the provisions of the said Act, and at the time of making his
application for the satisfaction of his claim must lodge with the Com¬
messioner the original land order under which be claims to be entitied
to select any section of land. innless such land order shall previously
v ben lodged with the Commissioner no claim can be heard and
determined until such orginal land order is lodged, or proof of the
loss given to the satisfaction of the Commissioner.
The Commissioner will report to the Governor the name of the per¬
son found to be entitied to land under any particular land order, the
particular number thereof, the fact of such land onder having ocen
lodged with him, or of his having received satisfactory proof of the
loss thereof, and the amount in value stated in such land order; such
report is to be considered and approved by the Governor in Council.
and forthwith published in the New Zealand Gazette, with the date
of the approval attached thereto.
Notification of the Governor's approval is a sufficient warrant to the
Com nissioner to issue to the persons named in such approved report
as being entitied to land, scrip for the amount of money originally
paid for the land order under which any such persons have been found
to be entitied, together with compensation to the amount of £1 for
every £1 sterling represented by such land order added thereto ; so
that every person found entitied shall receive £2 in value for every
20s. in value to which he shall have been found entitled, except in
cases of lost land orders, in which case proceedings must be taken
under the Lost Land Orders Act, 1861.
No scrip can be delivered by the Commissioner until the land order
in satisfaction of which such scrip is issued has been cancelled by

Upon the receipt of scrip all the right, title, interest, claim, and de¬
mand of the person to whom the same is issued, and of all other per¬
sons whatsoever, to the land in respect of which scrip shall have been
issued is extinguished; and the is ue of such scrip is, both at saw and
in equity, a full and complete performance by the Crown, on behalf of
the New Zealand Company, of the contract or obligation of the Com¬
pany in respect of which such scrip shall have been issued.
All scrip to be issued under the authorny of the said Act is trans¬
ferable and is receivable as cash by the Receiver of Land Revenue in

the provincial district of Wellington, but not elsewhere, and must be

the time limnited for making such application. All claimants failing
to avail themselves of the provisions of the said Act are barred, and
their claim extinguished by reason of such default.
Claimants not resident within the Colony of New Zealand should
forthwith appoint a duly authorized agent to do and perform whatever
may be requishse to obtam the benefit of the said Act. —Dated at Wel¬

DISCLAIMER.—Messrs. HARRISON, AINSLIE¬

E.C., in reply to several applications they have received, in conse¬
quence of their name havins been associated with an alleged dis¬
covery of the late Mr. Perry Downing for the conversion of Cleve¬
land iron into steel, beg to state that they are in no way interested
either directly or indirectly in the patent taken out to deal with the

FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (l) un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern nscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
catablished laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to shversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political econdmists, politicians of every shade
of cpinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

and Charles Addison (sometimes called Henry Percy), defendants.—
Upon motion this day made unte the Right Honourable the Master of
the Roils by counsel for the plaintiff, who alleged that the plaintiff
hath filed his amended bill in this Court against the defendants, and
that it appears by the affidavits of William Francis Morris and the
plaintiff, both filed the 20th March, 1866, and a further affidavit of
William Francis Morris, filed 18th April, 1866, that the defendant,
THOMAS WENTWORTH EDWARDS, has been within the jurisdic¬
tion of this Court within two years next before the filing of the said
bill, and that all due diligence has been used to serve the said defen¬
dant with a copy of the said bill, but without effect, and the said de¬
fendant is beyond seas, and that there is just ground to believe that
the said defendant has gone out of the realm, or otherwise absconded
to avoid being served with such copy, and upon reading the said
affidavits, his Lordship doth order that the defendant, Thomas Went¬
worth Edwards, do appear to the plaintiff's bill on or before the 21st
day of May, 1866 ; and the plaintiff is to cause a copy of this order, to¬
gether with a notice thereof to the effect, set forth at the foot of the
Consolidated Orders, Rule 6, to be inserted in the London Gazette and
in two newspapers published in the county of Middlesex, within 14
days from the date hereof.
Notice. Thomas Wentworth Edwards, take notice that if you do
not appear pursuant to the above order, the plaintiff may enter an ap¬
pearance for you, and the Court may afterwards grant to the plaintiff
such relief as he may appear to be entitled to on his own showing,

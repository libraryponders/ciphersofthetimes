TO the Reverend JOSEPH LEYCESTER LYNE.—
From Lieut.-Colonel Brockman, President of the Evangelical
Mission and Electoral Union.—Reverend Sir.—An action having been
commenced against me by you, in respect of certain placards and
handbills posted and distributed by me in the towns of Dover and
Folkestone, on the occasion of certain lectures delivered by Mr. George
Mackey in those towns, in the month of October last, and at which Y
presided as chairman. I beg leave to express my deep and unfeigned.
regret that such placards and bills should have contained anything of
a libellous character or at all reflecting injuriously upon you personally,
which I admit to be unjustifiable, and I therefore offer my sincere
APOLOGY to you for the same. Upon your accepting this apology,
which I intend to be as ample as possible, and staying the action which
you have commenced against me, I will at once pay all costs and ex¬
penses to which you have been put by reason of the publication of such
placards and handbills.
You are at perfect liberty to make what use you please of this letter,
and at my expense to publish it in The Times newspaper, and in any
two papers published in the towns of Dover and Folkestone.

DOYor obedient servant,

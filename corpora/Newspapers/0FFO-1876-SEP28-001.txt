Applications from persons supposing themselves entitled as Next of
Kin should be addressed by letter to the Under-Secretary of Str

No application can be attended to which does not state the date
and place of the soldier's birth, enlistment, and death,

of his regiment; his regimental number should also be stated if

Should these particulars furnished by the applicant not agree with
the facts recorded on the War Office documents relating to the de¬

agree therewith, then within three calendar months the Secretary of
State will furnish the applicant with the usual requirements needed
for the proof of the alleged relationship.
The application must be authenticated by the signature of the appli¬
cant, and his name should be affixed in the presence of the clergyman
or one of the churchwardens of the parish, or a Justice of the Peace;
the applicant's address, with the name of the post town, must also be
clearly stated. No personal application can receive attention.

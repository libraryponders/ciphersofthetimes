BEN RHYDDING, Yorkshire.—"To the ailing it holds
out the brightest hopes of recovery; to the exhausted and weary
it offers renewed vigour; and those in health may roam at pleasure
amidst some of the richest scenery in Britain."—Standard, Physicians,
W. Macleod, M.D., F.R.C.P., Edin.; Thomas Scott, M.D., Edin. The
therapeutic uses of the Ben Rhydding Waters are found very salutary
in diseases of the nervous system, of the stomach and liver; and from
the potash they contain makes them also specially beneficial in gout,
rheumatism, and diseases of the kidneys. The compressed air bath,
which is in daily use, is the most powerful curative agent known for
the cure of chronic bronchitis, asthma, the first and second stages of
consumption; also for palpitation and debility of the heart. The pure
and healthful airs of Ben Rhydding and the surrounding districts are
unrivalled in their curative results. They are, moreover, considered
by the Officers of Health from their restorative powers to be ad¬
mirably suited to give tone to the weakened constitution and to assist
other remedial agents in the removal of brain exhaustion and atonicity
of the nervous system. For detailed prospectus address the Manager,
Ben Rhydding, by Leeds.

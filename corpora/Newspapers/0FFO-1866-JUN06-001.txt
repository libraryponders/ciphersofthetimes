MREUZNACH.—The rumours spread abroad of
the cholera being at Kreuznach, and also of there being a con¬

cholera we have never had a single case since that scourge has made
its appearance in Europe; of soldiers we have had only some small
detachments marching through. There exists no cause at all why in¬
valids should be prevented from coming here, and going through their
course of our mineral waters without any risk or inconvenience what¬

NOTICE to TRAVELLERS proceeding to

to Russia should, to save themselves in¬
convenience, procure the visa of the Russian Consulate-General in
London to their passports.
The necessity for this will be the more apparent when it is recollected
that the subordinate officials in Russia do not as a rule understand
English, while everywhere, even in the remotest parts of the empire,
the visa and seal of the Russian Consul-General is immediately recog¬

The bearer of a Foreign-office passport need not attend personally to
obtain the visa. The passport, which must bear his signature, may be
forwarded to the Consulate per Registered Letter, enclosing the visa
fee of 2s. in postage stamps or otherwise.
Passports transmitted from the country should be posted three clear
days previously to the visa being required.
The letter must contain a fully directed stamped envelope, to cover
the passport when re-posted.
Passports torn and illegible, and those more than say five years old,
should be exchanged for new ones.
To prevent delay, foreigners naturalized in England must produce
their letters of naturalization on transmitting their passports granted
by the Foreign-office.
Foreigners, not naturalized in England, must procure the visa of
their respective Consuls before transmitting their passports to the
Russian Consulate for the indispensable endorsement.
Office hours from 10 to 3 daily, Sundays excepted.

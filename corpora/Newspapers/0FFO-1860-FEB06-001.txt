It is for the public safety, and with a view to prevent accidents, that

notice that upon application of any person at the Proof-house in Ban¬
bury-street, Birmingham, the officers of that establishment will examine
all firearms brought to them for that purpose gratis, and state whether
they bear the legal proof mark or not. No breach of the law by sending
out unproved arms can possibly occur except through direct criminality
of intention, or negligence so gross as to be scarcely less cuipable,
and the Proof Master and Wardens therefore earnestly request that
immediate information may be given to them of any rifles or other
arms known or found to be unproved, in order that legal proceedings
may be instituted against the offenders accordingly. £5 reward will
be paid upon conviction of any offender to the person or persons
through whose information such conviction shall be obtained.—B.

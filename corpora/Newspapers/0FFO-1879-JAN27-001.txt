varying from 12½, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (il un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (9) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths' work. The tax has beon condemned as inde¬
fonsible by statesmen, political cconomists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingiom. For
further particulars application should be made to the under-igned,

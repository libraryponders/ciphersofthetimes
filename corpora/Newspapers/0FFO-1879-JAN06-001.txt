stated that that gentleman had changed his name, and that in
commencing business he had dejsited with him certain valuable
bicteires by a reiative under pecuuar cireumstances. I nave had an
opportanity of making a full inquiry into the statements in question.
and have great pee ssure in saying that these inquiries have satisiled
me that for 18 years Mr. Lesser who is the well-anown pecture dealer

The following resolutions were

and convenience, and are able and willing to continue to do so.
2. That this Meeting is of opinion that the proposal of the Govern¬
ment is an interference with ordinary commercial enterprise, and ought
to be opposed.
3. That a Committee, with power to add to their number, be now
appointed for the purpose of watching the measure and taki
such
steps as they may deem expedient.
. 4. That the foregoing resolutions be signed by th

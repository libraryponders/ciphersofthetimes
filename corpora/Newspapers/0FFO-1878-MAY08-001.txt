THE contempt written across returned letter is a
revelation, opening blind eyes and killing chronic ideal infatua¬
tion. Years ago I was outraged to hear you were corresponding with
others as with me. Treachery risked good name and daily bread;
hence the advertisement that would otherwise have been unpardon¬
able, but I kept faith with you. I ask only one word, "Peace," and
if, after reading this, you can refuse it, I shall know your soul is not
worth the suffering caused by your scorn now and heartlessness in the
past.

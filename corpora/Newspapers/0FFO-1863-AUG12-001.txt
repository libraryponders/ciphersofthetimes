four, 20; by 14. Originally published at seven guineas the set, and now
offered (in the finest condition) at 12s. 6d. the set of seven. Mr. Tegg
possessing the plates of the above inimitable paintings, offers them at
this extremely low price, being desirous that every school of art and
every educational establishment in the kingdom should possess a copy
of these marvellous productions, which are without doubt the finest
conceptions of the divine Raffaelle. Painted in the zenith of his
glory in the last two years of his life, they possess all that the maturity
of his talents could impart to them; and whether the greatness of the
conception, the vigour of design, the style, or the expression are sub¬
jects of consideration, all must acknowledge they are proofs of his
continual progress. Indeed, it may truly be said these works are the
climax, not only of Raffaclle's productions, but of all those of modern
genius in painting. Sent post free throughout the United Kingdom.

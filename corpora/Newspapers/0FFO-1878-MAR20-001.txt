of COMMONS.—An earnest eff ort is being made to obtain (1) the
REPEAL of the DUTIES upon GOLD and SILVER PLATE, and
(2) a Select Committee of Inquiry into the Laws relating to Hall¬

plate, is unjust, impolitic, subversive of the recognised principles of
modern fiscal legislation, obstructive to art progress, and an insur¬
mountablc obstacle to technical education in its application to silver¬
smiths' work. It is further urged that "compuisory" hallmarking,
in these free trade days, is simply an anachronism, antiquated, effeto,
and mischievous. For all statistical information application should
be made to Edward J. Watherston, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

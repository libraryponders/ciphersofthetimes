that he has a PADDOCK of six acres, opening from the hall, for the
purpose of trying the dogs and giving them daily exercise. This is the

venting the dogs being chained up for so long a time, a desideratum
so important for the health of the animals, that the exhibition must
command the approbation and support of all sportsmen.
FIGHT HUNDRED to ONE THOUSAND

BITION, held at Ashburnham-hall, King's-road, Chelsea, on Monday,

with falls of real water ; also will be added, for the comfort and health
of the dogs, a large paddock of six acres for their use, exercise, and
trial if required, the only building so near to the west end with a pad¬
dock. In the paddock, with entrance to the hall, will be erected a
commodious waterproof marquee, boarded, and fitted up for ladies and
subscribers. The Exhibition will be held on the 23d of March, allow¬
ing two months for the preparation of the dogs, and also in conse¬
quence of the Exhibition of Dogs at Paris (patronised by the Em¬
peror and Court) taking place in May, to which several noblemen and
gentlemen intend sending their dogs from here to compete for the

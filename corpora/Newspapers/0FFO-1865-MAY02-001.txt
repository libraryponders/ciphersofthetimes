BATH NEUENAHR, the celebrated new SPA,
one hour from the Rhine, between Cologne and Coblenz, pos¬
sessed of the finest alkaline and tonic properties, and richer in carbonic
acid than either Ems or Vichy. Temperature 80' to 102' Fahrenh.
The waters are highly recommendable in chronic diseases of the chest,
chronic catarrh of the larynx and of the bronchi, in uric acid dia thesis,
gout, rheumatism, gravel, gall stones, dyspepsia, and in uterine and
nervous affections. The Kur Hotel, where are also the telegraph and
bost stations, is combined with the bathing-houses. For climate and
position Neuenahr has a decided advantage over the other spas on the
Rhine. The pamphlets by the late Professor Miller (in Edinburgh)
and Dr. Weydgen will give further information. Resident physicians,

that in pursuance of Resolutions, passed by the Committee this day,
the following addition has been made to the RULES for the BUILD¬

are required in ships of extreme length in proportion to their breadth
or

""The scantlings given in table G., are intended for ships the length
of which, measured from the fore part of the stem to the after part of
the stern-post on the range of the upper deck does not exceed seven
times their extreme breadth, or ten imes their depth of hold, tsken
from the upper part of floors to the top of the upper deck beams.
"For ships which are intended to exceed in length the abave named
preportions, the builders or owners are to submit for the committee's
approval, their plans, with full particulars, for giving the vassel suffi¬
cient additional strength longitudinally, either by doubling or thicken¬

the s heerstrake and increasing the size of the stringer plates, or
otherwi
A foot note has also been appended to sec. 8 of the above rules, re¬
commending that in all cases the sheerstrake be an outside strake, so ar
to admit of the butt straps, or lining pieces, being extended in one

e foreside of the frame next afore

strake wh

pieces to buits be fitted with the fibre of the iron in the same direction
as the fibre of the plating to which they are rivetted.
The rule, sec. 54, for the continuation of wood ships, has been
amended, so as to allow ships (wherever bui-t) origina ly classed : years
A1, a continuation of two years, provided they undergo the examina¬
tion therein prescribed.
It has also been a regulation that the windlass of all ships be ex¬
amined by unhanging and stripping wood linings at periods not exced¬
ing one-half the time of original classification, and at all special sur¬
veys under the rules. By Order of the Con

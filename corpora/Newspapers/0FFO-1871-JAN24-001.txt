MUNIFICENT PROPOSAL.—Special Christmas

The Board earnestly entreat AID to maintain this Institution.
without encroaching upon the small invested fund, formed chielly
from the gifts of departed benefactors and in compliance with their
wishes, hitherto held sacred.
Impressed with the importance of this effort, an old friend offers to
contribute £100, provided a further sum of £800 be raised in sums of
£100 each or otherwise, of which £400 remains to be obtained.
The Board cannot too earnestly commend this design to the sym¬
pathy of the benevolent, especially to those whose homes have been
desolated by paralysis or epilepsy. Will they not, in affectionate remem¬
brance of those they loved and who have passed away, co-operate in
the support of the only institution devoted to the gratuitous relief of
some of the most heavily afflicted of our fellow creatures?

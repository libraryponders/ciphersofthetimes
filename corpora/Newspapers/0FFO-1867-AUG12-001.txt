be 5, 10, and 20 paras, and 1, 2, and 5 piasters.
These labels will be put in circulation on the 1st of August next,
and will be exclusively adopted from the 1st of September following,
Their promiscuous use with the present ones will be freely admitted up
to this latter date, after which the old postage stamps ceasing to be of
any value whatever can be exchanged for those of the new issue at the
post offices of the realm during the whole of September and October
next. After the 1st September letters, patterns, or printed papers
bearing postage labels other than those of the new issue (and not bear¬
ing any of the latter) will be considered as totally unpaid. Should,
however, there be any postage labels of the new issue on the corre¬
spondence in question such correspondence will be treated precisely as
if no postage labels other than those of the new issue were attached to
it. These regulations will be strictly enforced.
The present notice is to be kept affixed at the entrance of each
office during the aforementioned period (that is to say, from the 1st of
August to the 31st October), together with a facsimile of the new post¬
age labels.

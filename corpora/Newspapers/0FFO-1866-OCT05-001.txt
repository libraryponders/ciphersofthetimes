IVEREND, GURNEY, and Co. (Limited).—The
Committee of the Defence Association begs respectfully to sug¬
gest to the shareholders throughout the three kingdoms in general, to
form AUXILIARY COMMITTEES in their respective localities,
with a view to the wider and more equal distribution of the incidental
expenses. From such a network of organization, moreover, the Com¬
mittee anticipates two secondary advantages: first, easier and more
regular communication between its constituents and itself; and se¬
condly, the eventual selection of a General Committee for the whole
country.
The Committee deems it right to add, that neither on its own mem¬
bers, nor on those of the Auxiliary Committees, will any pecuniary
responsibility rest, beyond, of course, their proportional contributions,
as shareholders, to an amount not exceeding 5s. per share.

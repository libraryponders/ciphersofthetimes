FORGERY.— JUDSONS DYES.—Victoria, 25 and
25, chap. 88.—"In a recent trial for forging a trade mark, turning
to the jury, with the view of explaining what had passed, his Lordship
said it was plain one wrapper (or label) was intended to be an imitation
of the other, and would have the effect of deceiving any person who
bought the article. It would be a monstrous thing that a person should
thus have the power of appropriating that which a man intended for
himself. It was of the utmost importance that it should be known
that the law had made it criminal to endeavour (to use a common ex¬
pression) to rob a tradesman of that which is as much his property
really as the watch in his pocket—namely, the character he gets for the
particular article he sells. He found that the prosecution had taken
steps, both at law and equity, to protect themselves, and he had no
doubt they would obtain some civil remedy, so far as the prisoner's
means might enable him to afford a remedy. He would hold over the
prisoner's head the fear of being punished for that which he had done;
and in the hope that the public generally would be aware, on the one
hand, of the protection which was afforded them in regard to such
rights as these, and, on the other, that evil-disposed persous might
know there was a law which would reach them in the event of their
offending, he ordered the prisoner to enter into his own recoguizances
in £100 to come up for judgment when called upon."—Leeds Mercury.
The proprietors of Judson's Simple Dyes have taken every precaution
to protect themselves, the trade, and the public, at home and abroad,
against fraudulent imitation of their dyes, Every Label, Box, Wraprer,
or Bill are impressed with their weil-known trade mark (which, toge¬
ther with title, are duly registered), besides which at the bottom of
every box of dyes a fac-simile of signature of the proprietors should be
observed. Daniel Judson and Son will press for heaviest penalties
(including imprisonment) in every case of frand discovered by them.

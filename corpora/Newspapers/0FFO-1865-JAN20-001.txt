TO UMBRELLA and PARASOL DEALERS and
the PUBLIC.—The remarkable durability of the PARAGON
FRAMES for UMBRELLAS is exemplified by a fact which has re¬
cently come to the knowledge of SAMUEL FOX and Co., viz; that
these frames are frequently taken out of old umbrellas and put into
new ones, and the extent to which this is done by some manufac¬
turers compels the patentees, Samuel Fox and Co., to notice it, and
to invite particular attention to their label, having their trade mark as
well as their name, which they issue only with new frames, and which
should be placed inside each umbrelia or parasol. Samuel Fox and
Co.'s frames, made of solid steel wire, are warranted in every way; they
are charged one penny per umbrella or parasol more than the frames
of other makers. Samuel Fox and Co.'s patent pebble tips are used
as an additional mark to denote their special manufacture, they are
charged without profit, and are of extreme strength and durability,
and will last as long as the frames; the various imitations of these
tips also necessitate reference to the label of S. Fox and Co.—Deepear,
near Sheffield, January, 1863.

PRESERVATION of the DISUSED BURIAL
GROUNDS of SAINT PANCRAS and SAINT GILES.—The
estry of St. Pancras are now engaged under the provisions of an Act
of Parliament in laying out and planting the disused burial grounds,
with a nlew to preserve them as memorial gardens. The cost will be
paid out of the public funds of the parish, as also the cost of main¬
taining and superintending the grounds when laid out. Many persons
of eminence are buried in the grounds, and as faras known every effort
will be made to preserve their gravestones or tombs. There are also
many head stones, tombs, and monuments, which, on account of their
antiquity, design, or otherwise, it is hoped will be carefully preserved and
put in decent condition, but such work as this can only be executed by
means of private subscriptions. The Vestry hope that those persons
who feel an iterest in this work will CONTRIBUTE towards raising
the necessary FUNDS. I am authorized to receive subscriptions for
this purpose, which, according to the desue of the donor, will be ox¬
pended either for the repair or restoration of any particular tomb or
monument, or will be placed to a general fund for the purpose of
general repairs. A list of notable tombs will be supplied upon applica¬
tion. In order to make the necessary walks, plant trees, shrubs, &c.,
it is also intended to remove to a part of the ground set apart for the
purpose the oid head and foot stones and tombs, from many of which
the inscriptions have been effaced, or in relation to which nothing is
known either of those who lie beneath them or of their owners or re¬
presentatives. I shall be glad to be informed of the whereabouts of
any persons who have an interest in any of thegravestones or tombs,
and every facility will be afforded to such persons to put their tombs,
&c., in repair. Any further information on the subject may be had,
and orders given to inspect the grounds upon application.

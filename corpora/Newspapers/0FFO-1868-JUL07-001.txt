INTIMATION is hereby given, that an Action of
Multiplepoinding and Exoneration has been raised in the Court of
Session in Scotland, and is at present depending before Lord Jervis¬
woode as Lord Ordinary, at the instance of David Young, Esq., some¬
time merchant in Leith, now distiller at Grange, Burntisland, only
surviving trustee of the original and assumed trustees of the deceased
Thomas Young, Esquire, of Rosetta, in the county of Peebles, some¬
time Inspector-General of Army Hospitals, against Joseph Jameson
Young Forrester, otherwise Joseph Jameson Young, of Easter Cul¬
more, in the county of Stirling, presently residing at Indiana, Indiana
county, Pennsylvania, in the United States of America, and otherwise
named and designed in the Summons of said Action, for the purpose of
having the estate and effects which belonged to the said THOMAS
YOUNG, of Rosetta, as the same may be condescended on, and the
amount ascertained in the said action of Multiplepoinding, paid over
to the persons who may have just right thereto, in terms of the trust
disposition and settlement, and relative letter of bequest, executed by
the said Thomes Young, dated 22d November, 1833, and recorded in
the Books of Council and Session 22d February, 1826. The said Thomas
Young died on 13th February, 1836, survived by his widow, who died on
1st June, 1867, and who was liferented in his estate by virtue of an
antenuptial contract of marriage. Under the fourth purpose of his
said trust disposition and settlement, the said Thomas Young directed
and appointed his trustees, or the survivor of them, to convert the
whole of his means and estate, heritable and moveable, with the ex¬
ception of the bequests therein mentioned, into cash, and so soon
as the same was realized, to divide and pay over the free proceeds,
after deduction of all expenses, to and among the children
of his late brothers. John Young, merchant in Glasgow, and
William Young, sometime distiller at Grange, parish of Burntisland;
Mrs. Ann Young or Shaw, of Seggie, his late sister; and Mrs. Betty
Young or Ireland, of Bannaty, his sister then in life, in such shares or
proportions as his trustees in their indgment and the circumstances
and necessities of the children of his late brothers, and his sisters,
might, by his Trustees, be judged proper and advisable, but declaring
that before any division was made, two sums of £1,000 sterling each
should be set apart and paid over to the parties therein named, to
whom the said Thomas Young thereby legated and bequeathed the
said sums. In which action of Multiplepoinding, Lord Jerviswoode,
on 9th June, 1868, pronounced the following interlocutor:—"The Lord
Ordinary finds the raiser liable only in one and single payment, and
appoints the dependence of this action to be intimated to the defenders
resident abroad, and other parties who may have any interest in the
fund in medio by advertissement in such papers published abroad as
may be deemed necessary, and once for three weeks in The Times news¬
paper and North British Advertiser. Signed, Charles Baillie." And
his Lordship, on 16th June, 1863, farther pronounced the following
interlocutor:—"The Lord Ordinary appoints claimants on the fund
in medio to lodge condescendences and claims thereon by the second
Box-day in the ensuing vacation. Signed, Charles Baillie." In terms
of the above interlocutors all parties claiming to have an interest in
the trust estate of the said Thomas Young, which constitutes the fund
in medio, are called on to appear and lodge their claims in said action.

WENHAM LAKE ICE COMPANY give notice that every
REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of their manufacture, bears their name
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felony,
This notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerous
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got un and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fee Com¬

FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes de not filter the pure water from the
block ice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any ether ice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery wid be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZING

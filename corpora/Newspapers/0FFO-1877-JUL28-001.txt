NOTICE.—Technical Education.—The Silver Trade
and the City Companies.—The duty of 20 per cent. upon silver
spoons and forke, and of 129 per cent. upon articles of daily use, is an
insurmountable obstacle to the art-progress of the silver trade. Mem¬
bers of Parliament (especially) and others intefested in the success of
techmcal education are earnestly requested to lend a helping hand, in
order that the TAX (at once unjust and impolitic) may be
ABOLISHED during next session, so that the silver trade may par¬
take of the advantages offered by the scheme about to be propounded
by the City Compames. For further particulars address Edward J.

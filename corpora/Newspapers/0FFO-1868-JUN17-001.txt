ONE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD.—In the
T
Court of Chancery: "Lumley v. Des.
be given for PROOF of the MARRIAGE of ALEXANDER VICTOR
with ELIZA HAINES, the daughter of Thomas Haines, a master
gunner R.N. The following circumstances will indicate the best points
for inquiry: The ceremony took place in the autumn of the
1827, while Thomas Haines was a mate on board the Georgiana, East
Indiaman. Shortly afterwards Monsieur and Madame Victor went to
reside in John-Street, Commercial-road, with Mrs. Haines, and a little
later.
three opened a millinery establishment in Hatton-garden.
It is believed that at the time of her marriage Eliza Haines was an
apprentice in the establishment of Misses Barton and Stevens,
Court milliners. In 1837 Monsieur and Madame Victor were
residing at 3
Park-street, Bristol, the former pursuing in
that neighbourhood his avocation as teacher of the French lan¬
guage. This continued till 1840, when Monsieur and Madame Victor
went into partnership with another family to open an academy
at West Park-house, Clifton, where Madame Victor's sister, Har¬
riett Iaines, came
—
and Madame Victor went on a visit to their relatives at Truro, where
Mr. John Brewer (who is Madame Victor's cousin, brother-in-law, and
trustee) states that he met them, but is unable to say whether they
were really married or not. In 1842 bankruptcy unfortunately en¬
sued at West Park-house. Monsieur and Madame Victor separated,
and took up different positions to what they had hitherto occupied in
society. Mrs. Haines being, at the time of the above marriage, of the
Wesleyan persuasion, it is not unlikely that it took place in a chapel.

ANNOUNCEMENT.—Messrs. ARTHUR CLEVE¬
LAND MONTAGU and Co., Confidential Agents, beg to an¬
netnce that, in consequence of the increase of their business rendering
additional accommodation imperative, and for the convenience of
their ceients, they have REMOVED their OFFICES to more coms
modious and accessible premises, on a lower floor, in the handsome,
new builsing on Ludgate-hill, known as Stationers'-hall-buildings.
where all matters intrusted to their care will meet with their best and
most prompt attention. Under the new arrangements and with the
additional accommodation at their command, there will be separate
rooms fon each partner and separate waiting rooins, for their clients,
so that clients, if they prefer it, need see one mimber of the firm only.
Messrs. Montagu's mode of conducting their business is now so well
known and so thorougluy appreciated, and their experience is so un¬
rivalled, that it is urinecessary to indulge in mere professions, and they
will therefore simply add that they will rely on the same conscientious
discharge of their duty that had hitherto characterized their practice
to insure for them a continuance and extension of that support which
has been already so liberaily accorded to them, and for which they beg
to return their best thanks.—Arthur Cleveland (Montagu and Co.,

PRIVATE INQUIRY OFFICE: established 1852.
—"Missing Friends in Australia.—We are constantly receiving
letters requesting us to inform correspondents how they may hear of
missing relations or friends in Australia. We have just learnt that
the Private Inquiry office, No. 20, Devereux-court, Strand, undertakes
this kind of business, through the agency of Mr. Berliner's Inquiry¬
office at Melbourne. A trustworthy correspondent sends us the
following statement:—A remarkable case of "tracing out a man"
has just been brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the efforts of Mr.
Berliner. A considerable amount of property was left to one George
Patteson, who was known to have left England for Australia in the
ship Argo, in 1853. His friends and solicitors made inquiries in vain¬
it was supposed that he had gone to the gold fields, and there shared
the fate of many an unfortunate fellow. About two or three months
ago this mysterious case was put into the hands of Mr. Berliner, who
speedily discovered that the veritable George Patteson had died in the
Melbourne Hospital, under the name of George Pearce. Among other
links in the chain of evidence was this, that George Patteson (a gentle¬
man by birth and education) had made himself a great favourite on
board the ship Argo; that when he arrived he had but little money,
and was soon hard up; that then he sold to a fellow passenger named
Davenport, residing at Emerald-hill, a variety of articles which have
since been sent to England for identification. Mr. Berliner has, how¬
ever, collected abundant collateral evidence to show that George
Pearce, who died in the Melbourne Hospital as a pauper, was really
George Patteson, who left England in 1853, because of a family
quarrel. The estate will now pass to the next of kin. Such is a
specimen of the romance of real life which Mr. Borliner is from time
to time called upon to deal with."—Reynolds' Nowspaper. The office
in London has had the conduct of some of the most remarkable cases
of the day, namely : The Smyth and Worcester Forgeries; the Rugeley
Murders horse poisonings, incendiary fires, divorce and libel cases.—

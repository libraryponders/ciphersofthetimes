NORTH AMERICAN LLOYD.—To Captain
A.G. Jones, of the North-American Lloyd steamship Baltic.
Dear Sir. The undersigned passengers on board the Baltic, from
New York to Southampton and Bremen, cannot part from you without
expressing the high sense they entertain of your character as a gentle¬
man and of your qualifications as a seaman.
To most people a sea voyage is a disagreeable task, and much de¬
pends not only upon the qualities of the vessel, but upon the character
of the officers, to relieve it of its discomforts and ennul. Many of us
have crossed the ocean frequently, but none of us have been better
satisfied in both these respects than we have on the occasion of our
present trip, now so auspiciously drawing to its termination. While
the Baltic can boast of ocean qualities not possessed by other steam¬
ships we have ever been in, you, dear Sir, even in the midst of your
most arduous duties and cares, are ever ready with a kind word and an
encouraging smile.
We may also add that the watchful care and polite attentions of all
your officers have not only streng thened our confidence, but materially
added to our comforts.
That a kind Providence may continue its watchful care over you and
all under your charge, and that the pleasant and anspicious trip which
you have just inaugurated may be the harbinger of many more
equally agreeable to yourself and your passengers, is the sincere prayer
and, hope of, Dear Sir, very respectfully,
Your obedient servants,
THOMAS GUILLE, New York.

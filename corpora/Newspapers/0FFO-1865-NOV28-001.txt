MARRIAGE LAW REFORM ASSOCIATION,
instituted for the exclusive object of promoting the passing of
an Act to render lawful marriage with a deceased wife's sister. The
Committee desire it to be distinctly understood that they have no
ulterior object in view. They have no sectarian or party bias in Church
or State. They do not desire any interference with the Prayer Book,
the Table of Prohibited Marriages being no legal part of that book, as
may be seen by consulting any of the standard copies. They desire in¬
terference with no canon that has not already been dealt with by, the
Legislature. They desire that no clergyman shall be compelled to
celebrate a marriage to which he conscientiously objects. They simply
ask for a class of marriages, permitted beneficially everywhere else, the
same validity which was, in 1835, with the consent of the Bench of
Bishops, granted to the marriage of the late Duke of Beaufort with
his deceased wife's sister, a niece of the Duke of Wellington. The



succceded his father in the House of Peers. Can any valid reason
be given why the other issue of exactly similar marriages should not be
legitimate equally?
Information respecting the proceedings in Parliament in reference
to this measure, and respecting the state of the law touching these
marriages in this and foreign countries, may be obtained on application,
personally or by letter, at the offices of the Association, where may
also be had numerous publications, showing the opinions of the most
eminent statesmen, divines, and others in favour of repealing the pre¬

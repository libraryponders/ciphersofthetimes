some of his most astounding feats. Miss Adele Blondin will appear as
the drowning child. This performance will take place on the newly¬
erected and elegantly-appointed stage in the centre transept. The in¬
teresting story upon which the plot is founded is briefly told. Fernando,
the proprietor of a plantation on the coast of Brazil, is waiting
the arrival of his wife and child from England; but the vessel con¬
veying them is wrecked before the eyes of the husband, who
succeds in saving his wife, and, as he believes, his wife only. The
child is rescued by the ape, and concealed in a cavern, where he is
carefully tended by his sagacious preserver, leaving the father and
mother in despair at their supposed loss. Meantime the monkey incurs
the displeasure of the peasants by the mischiveous tricks he practises,
and is at last shot by Sam, who tracks him to the grotto, and there dis¬
covers the concealed child, who is restored to his parents at the
moment that the faithful ape expires. The wreck scene, as well as the £
scene of the plantation, has been designed and executed by Mr. F. Fen¬
ton, of the Haymarket Theatre, the whole produced under the direction
of Mr. Henry Coleman. The incidental music arranged and conduc
Eted by Mr. Manns. Open in Christmas week at 9. Admission, to Fri¬

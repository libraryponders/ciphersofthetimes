CAUTION. — Whereas, several CONTINENTAL
FIRMS have again been VICTIMISED to an enormous ex¬
tent by a GANG of SWINDLERS, falsely representing themselves
(by advertisements in foreign newspapers) to be bankers, professing to
advance money at the low rate of 1 per cent., and by that means ob¬
taining good acceptances and bills in exchange for their spurious and
fictitious securities, these parties always changing their names and
shifting their temporary offices as soon as a successful coup is executed,
so as to make identification impossible and to defy punishment, this
public caution, it is hoped, will put a stop to their piratical exploits.—

CAUTION.—In the matter of Field's Paraffine

ably reported upon by scientific men of high repute, and has also been
noticed with approval in many of the public journals, and Messrs.

paraffine candles; and whereas candles of inferior paraffine, and
candles composed in part only of paraffine, are being introduced into

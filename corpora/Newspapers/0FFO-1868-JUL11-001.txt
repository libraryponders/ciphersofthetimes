parties of the terms "Brighton Seltzers," "Brighton Vichy," &c., to
waters with which Struve and Co. have no connexion, renders this

imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fce Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬
sary complications, are unequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability,

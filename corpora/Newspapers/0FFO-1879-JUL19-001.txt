CORPS of COMMISSIONAIRES.—The Adjutant
is able to RECOMMEND married and single COMMISSION¬
AIRRS for nearly every variety of duty, including that of C erks,
Timekespers, Porters, Messengers, Watchmen, Hospital Attendants,
and occasionally also fer the different branches of domestic service.
These men may be engaged by the day, week, or mouth, either in
town or country, and their honesty, sobriety, and strict attention to
the interests of their employers is guaranteed. The rate of pay varies
from 20s. upwards, and is fixed according to the qualifications of the
Commissionaire and the cccupation for which he is required.
Owing to the termination of the London season several sericants
who are about to complete their temporary engagements will be dis¬
engaged, and the attention of hotelkeepers and employers in general
requering men for short periods is spesially directed to this circum¬

The Adjutant will be happy to show his latest return from em¬
plovers respecting the men in their service, and is happy to state that
out of 500 repiies to a very stringent form of inquiry, there are not
half a dozen which are not in the highest degree satisfactory.
Men employed in domestic service can wear plain clothes or livery,
if desired.

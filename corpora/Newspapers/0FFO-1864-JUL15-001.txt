24214 to 24218, 9456, 10401, 1794, 2420? 28494, 28195.
The abstraction was legally proved by a judgment of the Tribunal
of Correctional Police of Paris on the 21st April, 1863.
An opposition to the transfer of, or payment of the dividend on,
those shares has been made to the companies by which they were issued,
and to the stockbrokers and bankers of France.
The stock and share brokers of Great Britain are by the present notice
requested to abstain from aiding in the negotiation of any of the above
tittles which may be presented to them, to detain the shares, and give
notice to Mr. Derouléde, attorney, 55, rue de Rivoli, à Paris.
NOTICE.—If the THREE BINNACLES, LEFT
at 12, Bucklersbury, are not claimed before the 1st of August,
1864, they will be SOLD to defray expenses.
THE late DISASTROUS FIRE.—Mr. J. A.
FINNEY, tailor, 109, Strand, whose premises were destroyed by
the fire at the Savoy Chapel Royal, begs to thank his numerous friends
and neighbours for their assistance and kind sympathy, and is happy
to inform his patrons that his BUSINESS will be CARRIED ON
partly at 109 and at 125, Strand, eight doors nearer Waterloo-bridge, to
which latter address all letters, &c., are requested to be sent.
CAUTION.—The METROPOLITAN STEAM
BLEACHING and DYEING COMPANY find it necessary to
caution the public that they have only two branches in addition to
their works at 17 Wharf-road, City-road, viz:—472, Oxford-street,
W. C., and 7, Pavilion-buildings, Brighton.
CAUTION.—G. W. WHEATLEY and Co. (formerly
Waghorn), established 28 years, overland parcel carriers and
general forwarding agents to all parts of the worid, caution the public
against being misled by imitations of their advertissements, placards,
and tariffs. —Wheatley and Co.'s only offices in London are 150. Leaden¬
hall-Street: Chaplin's, Regent-circus, 150, Cheapside, and 23, Regent-st.
TO Messrs. WHEATLEY and Co.—In consideration
of your abstaining from taking proceedings to obtain an injune¬
tion against me, I undertake and agree forthwith to cease to issue the
circulars, both books and handbills, of which, you complain; and I
further undertake and agree to abstain in future from using any title
in imitation of the title used by you, and further to abstain from copy¬
ing, extracting, or imitating the circulars or advertisements issued by
you from time to time. — Dated 29th day of July, 1863.

SPECIAL NOTICE.—Messrs. SUTTON and Co.,
General Shipping and Commission Agents, of 101, Leadenhall-¬
street, beg to give notice that the letter signed, on 29th July, 1863, by
W. R. Sutton, as proprietor of Mann's Parcel Despatch, and published
in The Times lately, has no relation whatever to their general shipping
and commission agency at 101, Leadenhall-street; and the letter, being
inserted in the same publication with a shipping advertisement from
another firm, tends to mislead the public and do us considerable

July 11, 1864. SUTTON and Co., 101, Leadenhall-Street,
CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements appear daily, stating that the
advertisers can reproduce cartes de visite portraits, I, CAMILLE
SILVY (as far as I am concerned) CAUTION all persons against such
proceedings, which infringe the acts for protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to
secure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number) ; and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

CAUTION.—Fox's Frames for Umbrellas and Para¬
sols.—SAMUEL FOX and Co., patentees and sole manufacturers
of the PARAGON FRAME, and manufacturers of frames made of
solid steel wire for UMBRELLAS and PARASOLS, beg to invite
notice to their label, which should be placed inside each umbrella and
parasol, and to caution dealers and the public against imitations of
their patent pebble tips. These imitations, which are brittle, and
easily defaced; are being used by other persons to cause inferior frames
to resemble those manufactured by S. Fox and Co., by which a small
extra profit may be made, at the expense of the durability of the
umbrella or parasol. S. Fox and Co.'s frames, made of solid wire, are
warranted not to lock together on opening the umbrelia or parasol,
and, from the superior quality and temper of the steel, will not snap,
nor become bent in the use. They are charged 1d. per umbrella or
parasol more than the frames of other makers. S. Fox and Co.'s
patent pebble tips, being used only as a trade mark to denote their
special manufacture, are charged without profit. They are of extreme
strength and durability, and will last as long as the frames.—S. Fox
and Co., Deepear, near Sheffield. July 13.
THE WIMBLEDON MEETING.—C. F.
HANCOCK, 39, Bruton-street, Bond-street, jeweller to the Queen
and the Prince and Princess of Wales, begs respectfully to inform the
mombers of the National Rifle Association, that the BADGES can only
be obtained at his establishment or on the ground; in silver 7s. 6d. and
in gold enamelled three guineas. N.B. A large stock of second-hand
plate, silver cups. prizes, and
stimonials of every description. Manu.
facturer of the Victoria crosses.
MESSRS. HANCOCK and RIXON. Lamp, Chan¬
delier, and Glass Manufacturers, have REMOVED from 1,Cock¬
spur-street, to 47, Great Mariborough-street, Regent-street, W., where
their business will be carried on as heretofore.
JOHN BROGDEN, of 16, Henrietta-street, Covent¬
garden, finding some of his customers think the business is removed,
respectfully informs them that this is not the case, he having pur¬
chased the goodwill, and the whole of the valuable stock, and that all the
workmoen remain at the old premises. He takes this opportunity of
returning his warmest thanks and acknowledgments for the kind
patronage and support bestowed on the late firm.—16, Henrietta¬
street, Covent-garden.

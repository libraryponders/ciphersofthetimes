of by Dr. Frankland during the late visitation of cholera (see The
Times, Oct. 24th, 1866), can only be obtained at ATKINS', 62. Fleet-st.
CAUTION.—HOWARD and SONS' PATENT
PARQUET FLOORING, No. 1,548, is entirely made by steam
machinery, at the Cleveland Works, and, unlike foreign work, is
guaranteed to stand.—All persons are CAUTIONED against imitu¬
tions and infringing this patent. —Howard and Sons, 26 and 27, Berners¬
street, Oxford-street, W.
CAUTION.—Messrs. S. and B. SOLOMONS,
opticians to the Government, beg to caution their customers
agains purchasing spectacles of travellers in the country using their
name. Messrs. S. have no travellers, therefore persons desirous of
obtaining the genuine tinted lenses should apply only direct to them,

No. 72, Baker-street; and Wales and McCulloch's, 56, Cheapside, and
No. 22, Ludgate-hill: or from the makers, Malvern.
CAUTION.—Water Filtration.—To prevent mis¬
takes the public are informed that the latest patented filter in
general use is the DANCHELL PATENT CISTERN FILTER
(patent sealed Sept. 29, 1863), which has superseded all others (vide Pro¬
fessor Frankland's reports to the Registrar-General, July, 1866, and Nov.,
1867), insuring as it does a constant supply of the purest water without
filling or any attention whatever. Can be rented if preferred in London,
and can only be had in London of the LONDON and GENERAL
WATER PURIFYING COMPANY, 157, Strand, four doors from
merset-house.
CAUTION.—In consequence of frequent misrepre¬
septations, E. MOSES and SON, merchant tailors, outfitters, &c.,

CAUTION.—Ice Safes or Refrigerators.—The
WENHAM LAKE ICE COMPANY give notice that every
REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of their manufacture, bears their name
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felony.
This notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerons
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fce Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬
sary complications, are unequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability,
and economy. Sole office, Wenham Lake Ice Company, 140, Strand.
CAUTION to DEALERS in PHOTOGRAPHS and
others.—Court of Chancery, June 12, before the Lords Justices
of Appeal, ex parte "Graves re Prince."—It having been decided by

ounishable under the Small Penalties Act by fine or imprisonment,
Messrs. Henry Graves and Co, trust that all persons will abstain from
purchas ing these photographs when offered for sale by hawkers and
others, and from directly or indirectly encouraging or inducing such
persons to infringe the law. Mr. Henry Graves will feel personally
obliged by any information (addressed to 6, Pall-mall) which may tend
to suppress this illegal traffic.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE¬
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the
blockice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this sclentific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Retrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any otherice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
right

MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 3156, Oxford-street, London.
MISREPRESENTATION.—The TEN GUINEA
SUITES, in 18 carat gold, machine made, as advertised, are oniy
to be procured at 37, Conduit-Street, Bond-street. Mr. STREETER
finds it necessary to make this announcement, as sets of ornaments,
stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their invoice.—

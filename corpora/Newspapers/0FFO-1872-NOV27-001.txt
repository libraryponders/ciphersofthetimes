ESCAPED from a MAISON de SANTE, in Paris,
a YOUNG GENTLEMAN, 26 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches in
height, stoutly built, has a masgive head, a peculiar drooping of the left
upper eyelid, and is clean shaved, except his moustache, which is waxed.
Speaks French like a native and has soft winning manners, being most
intellectually gifted, but in his paroxysms has no moral perception what¬

criminal. He assumes at times titled and high-sounding names, giving
drafts on bankers and others where he has no effects. Was dressed,
when last seen in Paris, in black overcoat with velvet collar. INFOR¬

DOG PROTECTION SOCIETY.
1. To do away with the absurd cruelty and annoyance occasioned
by muzzling dogs and the seizure of them by the police where the
lawful tax has been paid.
2. To prevent Sir Richard Mayne from ever again making a similar
order.
t now remains to be determined whether the obnoxious order
affects a sufficient number of persons so as to make it a public
grievance.
All persons willing to sign such preper documents as may be required
to carry out the above object sen
send their names and addresses, and
make their complaints, by letters written at their own firesides, with
the postage pre-paid.
It would be impossible to reply to all letters received, or to hold
interviews, without a staff for that purpose.
The poor man (to whom his dog is often his faithful friend and pro¬
tector), as well as the rich man, is requested to communicate his views.
It often happens that neither can afford to go rambling about to
different police stations to find their lost dogs

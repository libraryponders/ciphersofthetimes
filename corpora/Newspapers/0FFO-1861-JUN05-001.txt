NATIONAL ART UNION.—REPORT of FIRST
ANNUAL MEETING for DISTRIBUTION of PRIZES, held
at the Large Hall of the Whittington Club, on Thursday, the 30th May,
Mr. Alderman DAKIN presiding.
The report, read by the Assistant-Secretary, Mr. Rowe, stated that
the Council offered their congratulations on the great success that has
attended the operations of the Society, unprecedented in the annals of
kindred institutions. The total number of tickets sold was 5,840, pro¬
ducing £1,400, which amount, dedueting the working expenses, ad¬
mitted of the Council allotting 584 prizes of the value of £732 11s. for
distribution. The Council had, therefore, been enabled to do more than
redeem the pledge of giving "about one prize in 15 chances," as the
number to the distribution was in the ratio of one in 10.
The Chairman moved the adoption of the report, which spoke for
itself, and the number of tickets sold clearly proved that those who
had the management of the society had worked hard, and took a tho¬
rough and active interest in the advancement of its interests. The
Society had only been in real operation for a few months, and from
the extensive agencies, numbering nearly 1,200, it was hoped that a
corresponding increase in the number of members would be formed

Mr. Sayer seconded, and the report was adopted.

signed excugive origmator and inventor of "Thiers' Universal Auto¬
matic Ship Ventilator Alarm and Bilge-Pump," fully accepted and en¬
dorsed as to principle by the most reliable and experienced scientific
attaches of the American and English Navies, begs to announce that
he has devised an invaluable improvement in the aduptation and ap¬
plication of the aforesaid to all sea-going vessels, whereby the cutt ng
of deeks and the buiky requrements of large tanks or cylinders are
wholly obviated, reducing the expense of apparatus to a moiety of that
of the crude mechanical nevice thus tar imperrectly applied. As a most
happy analogue and congener of the simplu fland-piston, operatim by
the undulation of the seas, by which positive ship ventilation is accom¬
plished, the undersigned has happily devised the grand desiderntum of
a rotary lever isidreal vis motrix), through which the economy of
natural forees is u ilized in a manner whereby the largest public
or private builnings may be theroughly and positively ventilated for
a few pence per diem, forming, at the same time, a comparatively ex¬
pen eless and evererady motor for all light mechanical requirements.

God's humanity left in his nature, by far the largest share of pecuniary
resuits will be cheerfully accorded. Address per letter only, Wm.F

BRITISH PHARMACOPOEIA (1867). —The
Executive Committee of the General Medical Council give notice
that, whereas there are chymists who are still in the habit of com¬
pounding and dispensing medicines according to the directions and
formuls contained in the London Pharmacopoia, all such persons
should know that the British Pharmacopoia, as last amended and re¬
published by the Medical Council in 1867, is now, by 25 and 26 Vict.,
cap. 91, sec. 3, the only Pharmacopoia authorised by law.
And further that any chymist or other person who, without the sanc¬
tion of a legally qualified medical practitioner, should compound and
dispense medicines otherwise than according to the authorised Phar¬
macoposia, would certainly be held criminally responsible if the effect
of his so compounding and dispening should prove injurious to the
health or affect the life of the person taking or using such medicines.

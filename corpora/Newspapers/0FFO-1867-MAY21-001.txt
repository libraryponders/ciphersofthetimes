fast, Mr. Phillips, of Shrewsbury, and others, "That this meeting,
sympathising with the London master tailors in their efforts to frustrate
the unwarrantable strike of their workmen, who, at the dictation of the
trades union, are seeking to make the master tradesmen the instru¬
ments of inflicting on the public an unjustifiable and uncalled for in¬
crease in the cost of clothing, pledges itself to reject any consideration
of the time log presented by the Amalgamated Workmen's Association,
or any other log not based on a just regard for the interests of the
public, and an equitable adjustment as between employer and em¬
ployed." And also that this meeting be adjourned until the 12th day
of Juue next, to be held in Birmingham.

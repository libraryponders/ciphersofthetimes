and enjoy the amusements with the fragrance of the lovely flowers
and 20 acres of promenade in the grounds of the hotel—the
distance so short from Hyde-park-corner. No unpleasant mudbanks,
but a scene of gay and luxuriant flowers to enliven the mind from the
toils of the day, and give a zest to the appetite for dinner to the most
fastidious person. Talking of dinpers, the proprietor refers to the
thousands that have expressed their satisfaction at the manner in
which the chefs de cuisine have exerted themselves to produce the
most recherché plats suitable to the taste of the greatest epicure.
Wines shipped expresely from the growers. The splendid Cremorne
Sherry, free from acidity, and invigorating the system. The cases of
Champagne of all growers, Moet's, Cliquot's, Silver Eagle, all of the
finest brands, Hocks, Moselles, &c., of the finest quality, bins of the
choicest Ports, Clarets, dry Amontillade, and other Sherries—indeed
for comfort, nay luxury, there is no establishment can rival Cremorne.
Order your dinners. The last dinner supplied to the licensed victuallers
(near 2,000 pesrons) was pronounced the best ever yet served; and the
wines, selected by the committee from the stock, continually called
forth "an encore." Ladies and gentlemen dine on Sundays at the

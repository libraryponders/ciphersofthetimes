Service throughout the United Kingdom.
Applications from persons supposing themselves entitled as next of
kin should be addressed by letter to "The Under Secretary of State,
War-office, London, S.W.," and marked outside "Soldier's Effects."
No application can be attended to which does not state the dates

will furnish the applicant with the usual requirements needed for the
proof of the alleged relationship.
The application must be authenticated by the signature of the appli¬

Dated this 25th day of August, 1869.

EDWARD LUGARD.

ALBERT LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY.—
The INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE of Policy and Share¬
holders SIT DALLY at No. 1, Gresham-buildings, Guildhall, E.C.
THOS. HUNTER, Secretal
:
ALBERT LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY.—
INVESTIGATIGN COMMITTEE.—This independent Com¬
mittee of Policy and S are Holders has been in course of formation
for upwards of 12 months; the time for its action has now arrived;
the anticipated event which gave it birth having now culminated in
wide spread misery and confusion.
It has for its sole objects to secure an independent investigation of
the affairs of the Company, and to prevent (if possible) a liquidation
by the Court of Chancery, which would be ruinous to the share and
policy holders.
Every district should supply its representative on the Committee,
so that the strength derived from union may carry all before it.
No effort will be spared by the opponents of the objects promoted by
the Committee to throw difficulties in our way, Let, therefore, all
honest and injured persons discharge their duty with that single¬
mindedness which alone can stem opposition, fortily the cause of
right, and mitigate the consequences of this calamity.
It will be necessary to act promptly in this matter, as the Directors
have called a Meeting of Shareholders for the 28th inst., to sanction
the registration of the Company, so that it may be brought within the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery as to winding up.
I am prepared to receive authority to act. No liability whatever
for expenses will attach to persons placing their interests in my hands

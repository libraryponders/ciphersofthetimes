TO INDIA.—Let me have news of yourself. The
silence of the last four years has caused me great pain. I only
heard of your leaving England accidentally, a few hours before the ship
sailed. Can you remember the address you last used? If so, pray
write to me there, as I think it will always find me. I am anxious to
know that you are well, and where you now are living.—CENCI.
DEAREST DICK.—I am now perfectly calm, and
you may trust me most implicitly. I have not said a word about
the matter to anyone ; why then be so angry? Ill and broken-hearted
as your silence makes me, I have kept all my sorrow to myself. See
death named in advertisement of Sept. 7th. Letters on the subject
wait you. Write kindly and very soon to yours faithfully and
affectionately.

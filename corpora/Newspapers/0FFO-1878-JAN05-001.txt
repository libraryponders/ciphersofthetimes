known fact that the branches of production in which fewest
improvements are made are those with which the revenue officer in¬
terferes, and that nothing, in general, gives a grester impulse to im¬
provements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax
which narrowed the market for it."—John Stuart Mill's "Principles
of Political Economy." Buyers af silver plate need be under no ap¬
prehension that the abolition of the duty will in the slightest degree

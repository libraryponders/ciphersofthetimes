—Mr. E. BOURDON, 74, Faubourg du Temple, Paris, begs to
announce that his engagement with Messrs. Dewrance and
the sale of his patent gauges, having expired, he has APPOINTED
Messrs. NEGRETTI and ZAMBRA, the well-known instrument
makers, of Hatton-garden, London, as his WHOLESALE AGENTS,
from whom prices (greatly reduced) and terms may be obtained.
Mr. Bourdon directs the attention of engineers to the fact that the
gauges now sold by Messrs. Dewrance and Co. and others, as "Bour¬
don's patent gauges" are not of his manufacture, and that he is in
no way connected with any makers in England, his gauges having
always been, and still contine.

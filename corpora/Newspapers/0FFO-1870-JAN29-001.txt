"A few words about Paletots.—Struggling into a tightly-fitting top¬
coat is to my mind extremely disagrecable at any time, out especiany
so when you have on evening clothes or a jacket mane of a rough
woolly-surfaced material. Getting a tight grip, on the cuff of your
jacket, you make a violent thrust with extended arm, your hold sups,
and yuu find your cuff up to your elbow; off comes the top-coat, and
this time you try more warily, and, by dint of coaxing, the right arm
is through all right. Now for the lett; no, the arm-hose is everywhere
but in the proper place ; yes, that's it, a dexterous push: no, bothera¬
tion  it's the inside pocket. Try again. This, time you hit it on, and
possibly contrive to force your arm half way in, and there it frequently
sticks rast until the servant or somebony else comes to the rescue
and literally shakes you into the obstinate overcoat, and then,
ruffied in temper, and, figuratively speaking, ruffied all over, you take
yourself off about your business. This has so often happened to me
that I contemplated with a grim satisfaction the appearance on the
hoardings of a gentlemanly-looking individual, over whose shoulders
bung a kind of loose rug, that gave me the idea of being something
between a Mexican poncho and an Inverness wrapper. The figure
looked sleek, untumbled, and placidly comfortable, and I knew
at onos he must resemble a man who had not been compelied to

My mind was made up to go to the
advertiser's at once and try one of these onter garments; so, wending
my way to one of the agents of Messrs. D. Nicoll and Co., Fell-street,
Wood-street, I tried on the Rug-paletot, and was not a little elated at
finding what Thad so long been wishing for, in the shape of a wrapper
I could put on and take off without any trouble, and that would keep.
me at the same time warm and dry. it has aiso this aduitional advan¬
tage,—in a railway carriage it serves the full purpose of a rug for, the
kness and feet. 1 have no interest in anything Messrs. Nicoll sell, but
simply state my experiences for the benefit of others who may, like my¬
self, have beeu bothered with a great cost. I like comfort and bate
unnecessary trouble, and I find this new kind of covering most conve¬
nieny. I have frequently to call at several places, perhaps in the course
of an hour or two, and must either sit in my top coht, if I wear one,
and lose the good of it on going out, or taking it off, must undergo the
ordeal I so much dislike of putting it on again. The rug-paletot slips
from my shoulders in a twingle, and is as easily thrown over them.—
The Wanderer."
The above is copied from a leading London newspaper, called Land
and Water.

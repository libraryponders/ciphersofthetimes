SPECIAL NOTICE to MEMBERS of the HOUSE
COMMONS.—An earnest effort is being made to obtain (1) the
REPEAL of the DUTIES upon GOLD and SILVER PLATE, and
(2) a Select Committee of Inquiry into the Laws relating to Hail¬
marking. It is urged that the taxation, more espucially of silver
plate, is unjust, impolitic, subversive of the recognised principles of
modern fiscal legisiation, obstructive to art progress, and an insur¬
mountable obstacle to technical education in its application to silver¬
smiths work. It is further urged that "compuisory" hallmarking,
in these free trade days, is simply an anachronism, antiquated. effete,
and mischievous. For all statistical information application should
be made to Edward J. Watherston, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

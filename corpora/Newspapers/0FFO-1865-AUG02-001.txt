NOTICE.—If Mr. JOHN ALLEN CAMPBELL
ill apply at No. 47, Hanover-street, Kingston, Jamaica, he
will HEAR of SOMETHING to his BENEFIT.
WOU are yourself in great danger, and without sus¬
pecting it. The persons whom you trust are bent upon, and will
ultimately bring about your own ruin and that of your family. You
do not perceive how, nor do you consider by whom, vou are infiuenced,
You do not knew that I have no intorcourse with any German, and
that ne German in this country knows anything about me; that those
who pretend to know me are entire strangers to me; that my name
has been often made use of without my knowledge and consent; that
the minds of persons written to, either by myself or in my behalf, are
immediately poisoned, and that weight is given to their calumnies by
fictitious authorities; that letters of importance when sent direct do
not reach me. Pray, consider these points in all their bearings.—Dr.

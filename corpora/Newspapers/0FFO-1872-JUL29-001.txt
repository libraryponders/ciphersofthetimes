to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
"Wotherspoon v. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indisputably esta¬
blished, would also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penaity of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
heen induced to buy it, that to save them from total loss we will
ailow 20s. per cot. for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current juice. This will
entail a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up an i sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
me article useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake ice Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬

tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed

found in any otherice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZING

finds it necessary to make this announcement, as sets of ornaments,
stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore can¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their invoice.—

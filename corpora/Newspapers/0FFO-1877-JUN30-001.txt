to R.R.M.M.—Am in London for a short time,
should be pleased to see you, if not quite forgotten.—
sthags."
INO—GEORGIE.—You, and you only, can save me.
Turn not a deaf ear, or, when it is too late and I am beyond your
reach and loving voice, you will regret having forced yourself to be
thus cruel and hard. How can you so easily forget all? You grossly
misunderstand me. Am I to advertise in vain? Are you ill, or why
this silence? Relieve my anxiety, or I cannot bear it any longer.
How you can is inexplicable to me. Write. I beseech you. One
meeting would settle all finally and satisfactorily.

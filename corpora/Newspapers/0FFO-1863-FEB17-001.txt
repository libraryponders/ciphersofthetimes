the Board of Inland Revenue deem it advisable to give notice that any
person who shall make, sign, or issue, or shall accept or pay any such
note, which is not duly stamped, will incur the penalty of £50.

INFAMOUS TRAFFIC in YOUNG GIRLS.—Con¬
spiracy.—Whereas several evil-disposed persons, principally
foreigners, are constantly conspiring, with others out of this country, to
ALLURE young and innocent ENGLISH GIRLS to PROCEED to the
CONTINENT, under promise of lucrative employment (especially in the
capacity of governesses) and have succeeded in many instances by these
false representations in inveigling honest, industrious young persons
to quit their homes and proceed abroad, where they invariably find
themselves entrapped into houses of ill-fame without the means of
escape. This infamous traffic has of late so alarmingly increased and
baffied all endeavours to check it, that recourse is had to this public
notice, in the hope that it will prevent English girls from too readily
listening to any such proposals proceeding from questionable partiss;
and in all such cases they are requested to notify the same without
delay to Mr. Pollaky, who is instructed by Mr. G. B. Talbot (the secre¬
tary of the London Society for the Protection of Young Females,
No. 28, New Broad-street), to investigate, free of all charge, the charac¬
ter of parties, in England and abroad, holding out such inducements.

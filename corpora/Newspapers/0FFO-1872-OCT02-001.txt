for ever. Take care of your health, and be brave and strong.
know you can and will be so in time for my sake, even though it is
hard at first, and you have no one near to help you. But I trust you,
so I know you will go on tryig. Never despair or fear, for you know
you can trust me, whatever happens. I have been and will be good for
your sake. I am working hard, as you wished. Be sure I shall succeed
in time, and we shall be together, to help each other, and happy. For
ever yours.

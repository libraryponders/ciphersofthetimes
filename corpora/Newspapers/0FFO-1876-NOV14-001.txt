WHITE B.—Am much disgusted at not having
hitherto received any letter. Call for one from me, addressed in
the usual three mitials. You have certainly kept toyour promise about
writing, haven't you? For the last year all has been totmatch—abject
and pitlable cowardice, coupled with most apparent indifference and
abuse. Love of the mildest description being occasionally simulated.
Are you quite well now? Write immediately. In spite of all, I long
daily more and more to be with you again, but I suppose you'd be as
brave as before, so all I could de would be useless.

TO MARIA.—If your advertisement in The Times of
March 26 refers, as I somehow fancy it noes, to a friend of mine (P.),
Iask why do you listen to anonymous letters? Enquire for yourself of
those who really know how he has passed his time in sadness, in his
quiet country retreat, his one thought, bitter sorrow for the past, and
anxiety for a better understanoing on your part of the devotion he still
evidently bears to you, I believe in my heart much happiness would be
the resuit.—RECTOR. Matth., v., 9.

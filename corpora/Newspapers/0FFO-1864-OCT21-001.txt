CAUTION.—Fox's Frames for Umbrellas and
Parasols.—SAMUEL FOX and Co., patentees and sole
manufacturers of the Paragon Frame and manufacturers of frames
made of solid steel wire, for UMBRELLAS and PARASOLS, beg
to invite notice to their label, which should be placed inside
each umbrella and parasol, and to caution dealers and the public
against imitations of their patent pebble tips. These imitations, which
are brittle and easily defaced, are being used by other persons to cause
inferior frames to resemble those manufactured by S. Fox and Co.,
by which a small extra profit may be made, at the expense of the
durability of the umbrella or parasol. S. Fox and Co.'s frames, made
of solid wire, are warranted not to lock together on opening the
umbrella or parasol, and, from the superior quality and temper of the
steel, will not snap or become bent in the use. They are charged one
penny per umbrella or parasol more than the frames of other makers.
S. Fox and Co.'s patent pebble tips, being used only as a trade mark to
denote their special manufacture, are charged without profit. They
are of extreme strength and durability, and will last as long as the
frames.—S. Fox and Co., Deepear, near Sheffield, Oct., 1864.

CAUTION.—MENIER's CHOCOLATE (Chocolat¬

blance in the form of the cakes, colour of the covering, arrangement of

vented for the purpose of passing off their chocolate as the Chocolat¬
Menier, the purchasers should look for the trade marks, the real name
upon the back of each division of the cake, and the signature Menier
upon the seal of the cover. Imitators try especially the fine quality
(yellow paper) at the price marked 2s. per pound, because it is this thet
the public have particularly adopted; it gives the highest satisfaction
both for its low price and its excellent quality. Wholesale Menier,

COX and SON's CATALOGUE of MONUMENTS,
tombrails, headstones, memorial brasses, &c., designed by eminent
architects, with prices, sent for six stamps. The modern progress of
ecclesiology has led to a general condemnation of the barbarous taste
which formerly prevailed in this respect, and to a desire for the adoption
of more correct forms. The present catalogue is a contribution to¬
wards this desideratum, and as the designs here illustrated are exe¬
cuted at Messrs. Cox and Son's own workshops, they can combine
economy of production with excellency of workmanship and materials.

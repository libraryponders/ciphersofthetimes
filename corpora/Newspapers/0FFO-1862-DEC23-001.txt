WM. WILKES CAWLEY.

Solicitor for the said W. and J. Burrow.
To the SHAREHOLDERS of the LIVERPOOL and LONDON
INSURANCE COMPANY.
Gentlemen,
Beg your attention to the following facts:—Our
annual premiums are £563,000; our paid up capital is £200,000.
The annual premiums of the Globe are only £130,000 ; but their
paid up capital is £1,000,000.
Our dividend has of late been 30 per cent. on our capital. That of the
Globe has been only five per cent. on theirs.
Our Chairman, Mr. Tobin, is mistaken in saying that the Globe has
besides put away one per cent., or £10,000 a year as a reserve; for if they
had, it would now, at the end of 60 years, at only 3 per cent., amount
to £1,630,534.
But Mr. Teulon informed us at the late meeting, quoting from the
Globe balance sheet, that their total invested assets were only
£1,434,335 18s. 4d., of which £1,000,000 was capital. The remainder
can hardly be more than a fair provision for the liabilities. So this extra

Remember that we are not asked to put the Globe on an equal foot¬
ing with our own concern. We are asked to guarantee them for ever a
dividend of £10,000 a year more than they have ever made, and as large
an one as we have ever ourselves divided. These "Globe six per cent.
perpetual annuities" are worse than a preference stock. They are
guaranteed on the Globe capital, on our own stock and funds, an

the unlimited lability of each of us, whether any profit be made
or not.
No wonder that, in the expectation of such a bargain, the Globe

shares
up, and ours have gone down in the market.
But there is yet time to stop this ruinous and improvident bargain if
you bestir yourselves.
BOYour obedient servant,
A CO-SHAREHOLDER.

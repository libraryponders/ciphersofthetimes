CO-OPERATIVE STORES.—Extract from the
Feb
Court Journn.
9th, 1868: The co-operative-store system
continues to es
uncasiness to the trading classes, and reprisals are
threatened, especially against the Civil Service, by insisting upon the
ten tatives of the people obta



ach of the country's expenditure. The tradesmen are also


fes which the doctors demand, and point.¬
ing to the "much superior advice" which the German can obtain for a
orin a visit.
or ther, the extortionate demands of the lawyers have
been taken up, and finally a combination of tr
desn
is threatened to
preserve their
oe interest against the efforts of the public, It is clear

toperatres will ao
have it all their own way. But good
nenso will, we have no doubt, settle the little difficulty that has arisen
tradesmen will become less extortionate, and as

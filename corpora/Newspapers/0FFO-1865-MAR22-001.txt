AMANSION, costing not less than £50,000, SAVED
from destruction by the use of the HYDROPULT. "Swakeleys,
Uxbridge, Middlesex, March 5, 1865. Mr. Charles Pomeroy Button,
Hydropult warehouse, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London. Sir.—I have
great pleasure in recommending your Hydropult, for I fully believe it
was the means of saving my house from being burnt down, during a
private theatrical entertainment given on the night of the 23d ult. The
fire broke out from some unexplained cause, and, from the height of
the flames, no water could be thrown up to it with buckets. Your
Hydropult became therefore invaluable, and was applied so effectually
that in a quarter of an hour the fire was extinguished. Yours (signed),

MYDROPULT.—Caution. —Devices in imitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are calculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. The
proprietor therefore issues this caution, and respectfully intimates that
parties wishing to purchase the hydropult should examine the machine
offered for sale, and see if it has attached thereto a label, with the fol¬
lowing words:—"The Hydropult, Vose's Patent, manufactured only
by Griffiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles Pomeroy Button,
proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London." Unless this label is
attached the machine is not the hydropult. Hydropults weigh but 81b.,
and will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. Hydropults will draw
water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. Hydro¬
pults can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or forcepump is
applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances are useless.
Hydropults have been recommended as an efficient and useful fire¬
engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of Great
Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department as
fire-engines. Robert Hogg, LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibberd, Esq.,
F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other well¬
known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable garden
implement. Hydropults have been recommended by the Gardeners
Chronicle, Journal of Horticulture, Gardeners Magazine, Daily Tele¬
graph, Liverpool Daily Post, Commercial Daily List, Illustrated News
of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Magazine, City Press,
Insurance Gazette, and other first class journals throughout Great
Britain. An illustrated prospectus, with testimonials, free on applica¬
tion to CHARLES POMEROY BUTTON, 142 and 143, Cheapside, E.C.

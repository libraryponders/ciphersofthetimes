ELKINGTON and Co., Patentees of the Electro¬
Plate, desire to impress upon public attention the fact that all
articles of their guaranteed manufacture are distinctly stamped with
their trade mark, E. and Co. under a crown, in a shield—the represen¬
tation now so frequently nade, that articles, often of the most inferior
description, are plated by Elkington and Co.'s process, is entirely value¬
less as a criterion of quality. In the case of "Elkington v. Johnson,"
recently tried before Vice-Chancellor James, defendant having unlaw¬
fully psed their marks, a perpetual injunction was granted restraining
defendant from using or imitating their name or trade marks: and
Elkington and Co. give notice that they will take LEGAL PROCEED¬
INGS against all persons USING or IMITATING their NAME or
TRADE MARKS. Manufactory, Newhall-Street, Birmingham

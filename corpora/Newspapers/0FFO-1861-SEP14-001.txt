BLONDIN at the CRYSTAL PALACE on Tuesday

CRYSTAL PALACE.—Blondin at Strange's Shil¬
ling Festival, on Tuesday next.—M. BLONDIN will (by special
desire) REPEAT his EXTRAORDINARY CHAIR FEATS, which
must be seen to be believed. Taking a common four-legged chair on
to the high rope 160 feet from the ground, he sits, stands, and lounges
thereon, balancing the chair on one or two legs and shifting it in every
direction while sitting on its seat or back. He will also run at full speed
from the centre to the southern mast, merely pausing to rest himself
by turning a few somersaults and standing on his head. He will re¬
turn to the centre (a distance of over 200 yards) with his eyes bandaged
and his head and body enveloped in a thick sack. In this quaint cos¬
tume he will prove the impossibility of falling from the rope, and again
rest himself by throwing a few somersaults. After divesting him¬
self of the sack he will proceed towards the northern mast to fetch his
chair, staying for a short time to hang from the rope by one or both
legs, and to give a practical illustration of the use of a slack rope sus¬
pended from the main rope. Returning to the centre the astounding
chair feat will conclude the performance. Open at 9. Blondin at 4.
Admission 1s.

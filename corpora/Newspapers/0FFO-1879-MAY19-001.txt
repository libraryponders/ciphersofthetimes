this holy day we commemorate the passing into the heavens of our
blessed Lord in our human nature.

psalms and lessons, and proper preface in the Communion service.
Will the faithful laity keep the feast? Opportunities for Divine
worship will be afforded in all the churches (it is hoped) in the land.

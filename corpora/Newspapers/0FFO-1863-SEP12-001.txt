SPECIAL NOTICE.—The FOREIGN VINE¬

gistered in 1854.—The Directors find it necessary to CAUTION their
friends and the public that the only offices in London of the above Com¬
pany are at 190, Regent-street, W., and that the Association has nocon¬
nexion with any company or establishment trading under titles closel
resembling the above. All communications to be addressed to W. H.

CAUTION.—MAIZENA.—The immense success
of this article has brought unprincipled persons into the market
with imitations copying from The Times, &c., the notices given the
Maizena. There is but one true Maizena, and this received, of all
competing articles, the only Prize Medal of the Exhibition, 1862, and
was also reported by the jury exceedingly excellent for food. Every
genuine packet has our name thereen. Circulators of the fraudulent
will be prosecuted the name Maizena being protected by law.—

CAUTION against COPIED
NOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements have
ppeared, stating that the
advertisers could now produce cartes de visite by photogra
oe e

price, I CAMILLE SIL E n,
taein all persons against such pro¬
ceedings, which infringe the acts for the protec
of property in works
of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs can¬
not be obtained by this method, there being
lways a great differenec
between a spurious copy and the ori on¬
bor. n order to secure, at
any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them in perfect
order from first to last (about 15,000 in number), and from these plates.
and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining proofs, either of
the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.—33, Porchester¬

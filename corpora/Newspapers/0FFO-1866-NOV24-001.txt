Upon the application of the plaintiff, and upon hearing the solicitors
for the applicant, and it being alleged that the plaintiff hath filed his
bill in this Court against the defendant, and that it appears by the re¬
spective affidavits of John Kirkby and Henry Squires, both filed the
8th November, 1866, that the defendant, TIMOTHY INGHAM, has
been within the jurisdiction of this Court within two years next before
the filing of the said bill, and that all due diligence has been used to
serve the said defendant with a copy of the said bill, but without effect,
and that upon inquiry at the last known place of abode of the said de¬
fendant, Timothy Ingham, and at other places where, at the time
when the said bill was filed, he might most probably have been met
with, he could not be found, so as to be served with a copy of the said
bill, and that there is just ground to believe that the said defendant
has gone out of the realm or otherwise absconded to avoid being served
with such copy, and upon reading the said affidavits; it is ordered
that the defendant, Timothy Ingham, do appear to the plaintiff's bill on
or before the 1st day of January, 1867; and the plaintiff is to cause a
copy of this order, together with a notice thereof, to the effect set forth
at the foot of the 10th of the Consolidated Orders, rule 6, to be inserted
once in the London Gazette within 14 days from the date hereof, and

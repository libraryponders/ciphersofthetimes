COLLECTORS of TAXES.—Petition in reply to
certam statements put forth by the Right Hon. the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, in his Badget speech, 11th April, 1870.—To the Honour¬
able the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ire¬
land in Parlament assembed:—The respectful PETITION of the
undersigned COLLECTORS of the INCOME TAX, inhabited house
duty, land-tax and assessed taxes, in the Metropolitan districts, humbly
sheweth, That your petitioners have heard that it is proposed to alter
the laws relating to the collection of the taxes on income, inhabited houses
and land, because it has been alleged by the Board of Inland Revenue
that the collectors of taxes are for the most part utterly indifferent
to the interests of the Exchequer, and sometimes openly opposed to
those interests, and engaged in doing their best to thwart the in¬
tentions of the Legisiature. That there are many of the collectors
illiterate, many corrupt; that for the purpose of instructing them in
their outy, and restraining them in doing wrong, both to the Crown
and to the subject, it is necessary for the Government to maintain
another large staff of officers to go over the same ground; and that,
after all these precautions, there remains an amount of evasion of
taxation that would scarcely be accounted for by mere carelessness.
That your petitioners, who are men moving in respectable station
of life, and who give security for the moneys they collect to large and
even excessive amounts, feel themselves to be unjustly disparaged and
seriously agrioved by such statements as are above recited, from what¬
soever source the same may emanate ; and your petitioners are pain¬
fully concerned to know that such injurious accusations can be put
forth against one class of men to procure their removal from their
offices for the advantage of another class, upon high oflicial authority.
That your petttioners, for themselves and their colleagues, respect
fully affiris that in every importaut district, and as to the largest por¬
tion of those branches of Revenue whice they have had to assess and
collect, they have discharged their duties honourably, and equally with
justice to the interests of the Revenue and courresy towards the public.
At must be cenceded that to their diligence in their department (the
proof of which is financially evident at the present period) the satisfac¬
tory condition of the Revenue in a proper degree is due, and that the
imputations applying to this point are groundless and undeserved.
That your petitioners do not deny that in small towns, rural
parishes, and places of inferior importance, incompetent and unsuit¬
able persons have been unavoidably appointed as collectors, under the
compusory operation of the law; and defalcations which unhappily
have occurred by delinquents in public departments under Govern,
ment control, as well as among the multitude of parochial collectors
of laxes, are yet, in relation to their numbers, believed to be more
rare instead of more frequent among the latter class of officers.
Your petitioners therefore pray your Honourable House toltake
steps, before any alterarions in the mode of collection are cnacted, to
inquire into the truth of the charges brought against the present col¬
lectors of taxes, especially in the metropolis and the principal cities
and towns of the kingdom, and also as to the real economy of any such
changes; and that, moreover, your Honourable House will not be
unminoful, if any such changes be made, that your petitioners have
most of them for many years been or become chiefly dependent upon
the pay of their employment, of which they may thereby be deprived,
and that in general a long succession of annual re-appointments serves
to afford in their behalf individually, a strong moral refutation of these
charges, and to establish claims to the just consideration of your
Honourable House.
And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.
Signed by 80 Collectors present at a Meeting held at the Freemason
Tavern, Great Queen-street, on Monday, 25th of April.

INGRAM and KEMP'S IMPROVEMENTS in
HALL and other LAMPS.—Patent No. 3,172, 9th November,
1867.—I, the undersigned John Sanders, of Hockley-street Works,
Birmingham, lamp manufacturer, admit that I have INFRINGED
the above PATENT of Messrs. INGRAM and KEMP, but such in¬
fringement was made in ignorance of the existence of their patent
and, in consideration of their staying legal proceedings against me, I
hereby undertake to desist from making any more lamps infringing
upon their patent, and also to pay a royaity upon every such lamp sold
by me, together with all legal and other expenses incurred by Messrs.
Ingram and Kemp in relation to the matter. As witness my hand this
1st day of April, 1870.

ELKINGTON and Co., Parentees of the Electro¬

articles of their guaranteed manufacture are distinetly stamped with
their trade mark, E. and Co., under a crown, in a sh eld—the represen¬
tation now so frequently made, that articles, often of the most inferior
description, are plated by Elkington and Co.'s process, is antirely value¬
less as a criterion of quallty. In the case of "Flington v. Johnson,"
recently tried before Vice-Chancellor James, defendant having unlaw¬
fully used their marks, a perpetual injuuction was granted restraining
defendant from using or imitating their name or trade marks; and
Elkington and Co. give notice that they will take LEGAL PROCEED¬
INGS against all persons USING or IMITATING their NAME or
TRADE MARKS. Manufactory, Newhall-Street, Birmingham;

ANCHOR BRAND IRON WIRE.—Edelsten v.
Edelsten and Williams.—CAUTION.—An injunction was
granted on the 30th day of August last by Vice-Chancellor Wood in a
suit instituted by James Edelsten, of Warrington, and of the city of
London, wire manufacturer, trading, under the firm of Edelsten and
Price, and sole manufacturer of the anchor brand wire, against Peter
Edelston and John Alfred Williams, of Birmingham, restraining the
defendants from using the trade mark of the plaintiff, or any mark in
imitation thereof, or only colourably differing therefrom. Messrs.
Edelsten and Price beg to caution the public that the genuine anchor
brand consists of a circular tally of about one inch in diameter, stamped
with the device of an anchor, the numbers by which the respective
sizes are known, and the words "Iron Wire," or "Charcoal Wire," the
former in white the latter in yellow metal; and all descriptions of wire
sold with tallies varying from the above description, but marked with
the device of an anchor, either with the addition of a crown, or any
other colourable imitation of, or variation from, Messrs. Edelsten and
Price's trade mark, are spurious. All persons detected in the sale of
wire, with tallies of such description as to infringe on the rights of
Messrs. Edelsten and Price, to the sole use of their said trade mark,
will be proceeded against according to law; and all persons who may
have purchased wire bearing such spurious trade marks as above, are
requested, in the interest of legitimate trade, to communicate the facts
to Messrs. Edelsten and Price, at any of their addresses below, namely.
—Manufactory, Winwick-street, Warrington; City of London wire
works and depots—44, Skinner-street; 6 and 8, Snow-hill; and 11, Sun¬

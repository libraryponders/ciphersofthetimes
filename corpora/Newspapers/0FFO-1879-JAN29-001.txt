FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An

varying from 12, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionabse system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, secing that no other suilar trane is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subvermve of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (contrary to the
established laws of political cconomy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths' work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensiale by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

see her, and took her to station not to make your people suspicious.
I am longing to be again near you.
—Many thanks for all your kindness, but there is
some mistake, as I have never read the words to which you
refer. Have sent no present. You asked me to call for a letter at
B., that is why I said I was not there or near it. I find my words
echoed elsewhere, even the letters I sign, R. A., used; but I never
write in any paper but this and seldom see any other. This may have
misled you, and 1 am very sorry for the confusion.—A.

EREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An

tam perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articles of oally use, and by the
stir more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (l un¬
jiust, seeing that no other samilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual dimmution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
eetablished laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths' worr. The tax has been condemued as inde¬
fonsiple by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and nota bly by the press of the Umted Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

FITZGERALD versus

sequence of the verdict for the plaintiff in the late cause of "Fitz¬
gerald versus Northcote," the costs of both parties in the suit will fall
upon Dr. Northcote. Several gentlemen have resolved to endeavour to
raise a FUND to meet these very heavy expenses, and at the same time
to express their sympathy with Dr. NORTHCOTE. The amount of
subscriptions in aid of the cost received to this date amounts to
£643 3s. 6d. The costs will be about £800, leaving a sum of about £160
to be still collected. Those who have not as yet forwarded their sub¬
scriptions, and sympathise with Dr. Northcote, are requested to for¬
ward their donations to George Blount, 28, Old Burlington-street, W.
TO the NOBILITY and GENTRY.—The UNITED
COACHMAKERS' SATURDAY FOUR O'CLOCK COM¬
MITTEE respectfully inform the nobility and gentry that the work¬
men now leave at 4 o'clock on Saturdays, and most of the leading firms
also close their shops at that time ; but, as a few remain open until 6
through customers calling, the Committee most respectfully ask the
nobility and gentry to discontinue their visits on Saturday afternoons,
and so enable the whole of the men to leave at 4 o'clock. They also
hope that those coachmakers who have not adopted the practice will
see the injustice they are doing to those employers who have thus
acceded to the general desire of the trade. A list of firms closing at 4
will shortly be issued.

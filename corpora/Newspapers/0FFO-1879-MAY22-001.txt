George's, Camberwell, Surrey (who died in June or July, 1854).
The said Mary Hughes was entitled, during her life to part of an
annuity of £50 a year given by the will of William Upton, deceased.
An action has been brought, in the Chancery Division of the High
Court of Justice, by Mrs. Foster, claiming the capital of the fund out
of which the said annuity has been paid. If the said Mary Hughes
did any act in her lifetime to sever the joint tenancy between herself
and the other annuitants as to such annuity, the said Mary Hughes's
children are probably entitied to one-third of the said capital fund.
The CHILDREN of the said Mary Hughes are requested to COM¬
MUNICATE, immediately, with Mr. R. Barnes, who has been ap¬
pointed to represent the estate of the said Mary Hughes in the said
action, to enable the said R. Barnes to support the claim (if any) of
the children of the said Mary Hughes to such one-third of the said
capital fund. Answers to this advertissement are to be sent to Mr.
Barnes's Solicitors, Messrs. Burgoynes, Milnes, Burgoyne, and Thrupp,

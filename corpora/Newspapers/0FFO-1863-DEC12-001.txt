SPOLIATION of FINSBURY-CIRCUS.—At a
MEETING of the Inhabitants of Finsbury-cireus, held at the
Castle Tavern, Moorgate, Dec. 9th, ALFRED SMEE, Esq., F.R.S.,
in the chair, the following resolutions were carried unanimously:—
That the inhabitants of Finsbury-circus regard with surprise and
regret, after the determination of the Legislature to protect the
gardens of the squares of the metropolis, that no less than three rail¬
roads, including the Metropolitan, are projected, which involve the
reckless spoliation of the garden of Finsbury-circus.
That a Committee of the House of Lords having carefully framed
rules for the guidance of railroad projectors in the formation of lines
throughout London, it is the opinion of this meeting that the wilful
neglect of these rules is not only disrespectful to the Legislature but
a wanton disregard of private rights; and that the repeated Parlia¬
mentary notices which year by year have harassed the inhabitants of
Finsbury-circus inflict great and unnecessary injury upon them.
That the inhabitants request the Committee of Management to op¬
pose the Metropolitan and other railway lines seeking to spoliate the
garden, and in conformity with the above views to present petitions to
both Houses of Parliament, the Board of Trade, the Board of Werks,
and to petition that the railroad projectors who seek Parliamentary
powers to construct lines, in contravention of principles laid down by
the Legislature, may be made amenable for any injury inflicted upon
individuals by loss of trade and deterioration of property caused by

THE ACCIDENT to the RAILWAY BRIDGE at
BARCELONA.—PUBLIC APOLOGY.—In the November
number of the Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal, of which I am
the proprietor, I inserted an account of an accident which occurred a
short time previously to a railway train, in crossing a bridge between
Barcelona and Greenollers, in consequence of the failure of the foun¬
dation of a pier, and by which more than 100 lives were lost, and a
large amount of property destroyed. In that account I stated that
Messrs. De Bergue and Co., of Manchester, the eminent builders of
iron bridges, and who have erected a great number of such bridges in
Spain and on the continent, were the builders of that one. This state¬
ment. I now find, was totally incorrect, as that firm had nothing what¬
ever to do with the construction or erection of the bridge in question.
I very much regret to find that the currency I have heedlessly given
to this statement has caused annoyance and loss to Messrs. Bergue and
Co., in whose professional skill I am satisfied there is no cause for im¬
putation. I therefore offer the most ample apology in my power to
Messrs. De Bergue and Co. for having been the means of circulating
such an unjust charge, and beg to express my thanks to them for their
kindness in withdrawing the proceedings they have instituted against
me in consequence of having published such a libel.

ANILINE DYES.-Girard's Patent. — Whereas, asuit
having been instituted against the undersigned Antoine Labore, of
Huddersfield, in the county of York, by Messrs. Renard, Freres et Franc,
of Lyons, and Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson, of London, for
an INFRINGEMENT by me of GIRARD's PATENT for blue and
violet dies, I submitted to a perpetual injuuction issuing from the
High Court of Chancery, to restrain me, my workmen, and agents,
from making and selling or selling, and from otherwise in any manner
infringing the said letters patent; and whereas since the said injunc¬
tion was awarded, I have made and sold blue and violet dyes in in¬
fringement of the said letters patent, and have thereby subjected my¬
self to imprisonment for contempt of the High Court of Chancery
but at my earnest entreaty the said plaintiffs have abstained for
this time only from moving the said Court for that purpose:—Now
therefore I express my regret for having disregarded the said injunc¬
tion, and hereby notify that I have diccontinued to make and sell or
sell any blue and violet dyes made in frand of the rights of the said
plaintiffs, and I undertake to account to the said plaintiffs for all
proffis made by such sales as hereinbefore mentioned.

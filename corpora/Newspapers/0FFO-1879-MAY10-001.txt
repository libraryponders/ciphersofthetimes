SPECIAL NOTICE.—ALFRED WEBB MILES
and COMPANY, Merchant Tailors and Clothiers, of 12, Brook¬
street, Hanover-square, W., in view of the present agitation with re¬
gard to the so-cailed co-operative and mutual societies (but which
are in reality merely ordmary trading companies), desire to impress
on their patrous that it is now more than 38 years since Mr. Miles, the
founder of the firm, introduced that reform in the price of GENTLE¬
MEN'S CLOTHING (in antagonism to the delusive credit system)
which has rendered his name a household word in all parts of the
world. A. W. Miles and Company are so satisfied that no society
with expensive managers and directors (who as a rule have no interest
in the success of the business beyond receiving their salaries) can
compete with an old-established firm in which each partner is con¬
stantly and zeaiously superintending the different departments, that
they have determined on meeting the quest on at once on its merits.
and to challenge any society to supply goods of equal quality and
fashion on the same terms. A. W. Miles and Company, in addition
to their usual large and well selected stock, have arranged to offer ex¬
cellent trousers of sound Scotch (all wool and thoroughly shrunk) ma¬
terial, at 13s. per pair, or two pairs if ordered at the same time for
25s. The world-famed 16s. Trousers will be more varied and of better
value than ever, and two pairs of this quality will be charged only
30s. In addition to these Specialities A. W. Miles and Company have
one of the largest and best assorted Stocks in Europe, and respect¬
fully invite gentlemen who pay cash (as only on that principle can
such an economical system be developed) to honour them with a visit.
Patterns and cards showing mode of solf-measurement sent free to any

DISTINGUISHED FOREIGNERS.—A corre¬
spondent of the "Queen" writes:—"During the last summer
I have, on several occasions remarked, among the fashionable arrivals
in London, the names of distinguished foreigners. Some of their titles
are so extraordinary, and so unlike any of the titles of nobility which
I ever heard abroad—as queer as the Marquis of Carrabas and Count
Carambole—that I cannot help thinking that many of them are ficti¬
tious, and adopted only as travelling titles, as noms de guerre. I only
hope that some of my bair countrywomen may not have had occasion
to repent their too ready acquaintance with titled foreigners. I know
a young lady who was nearly being married to a "Count Jones"—such
a Count! Captain Marryatt's "Count Chucks" was a Prince to him.

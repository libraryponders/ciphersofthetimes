NATIONAL MEMORIAL to the POET MILTON.
—Restoration of the Parish Church of St. Giles-without-Crip¬
plegate, in the City of London.—Stimulated by the noble example of
what has recently been done in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon to
hand down to posterity the immortal name of Shaksecare, the Restora¬
tion has been suggested of the ancient Church of St. Giles-without-¬
Cripplegate, as a lasting and becoming recognition of the equally re¬
nowned name of Milton, that church being the receptacle, with those
of his father, of this great poet's ashes, as well as being worthy (on
account of its celebrated architectural character) of all that is con¬
templated respecting it.
The project in view, therefore, recommending itself, as it is felt it
must, to every lover of sacred poetry as well as to every admirer of
our National Church and ecclesiastical architecture, is placed before
the British public with the fullest confidence of sympathy and co¬
operation.
A Committee, consisting of the Vicar, Churchwardens, and others in
the parish has been formed to carry out the object, by any of whom
contributions will be gratefully received, or by them through the
Honorary Secretaries; also at the banking-houses of Messrs. Barclay
and Co., 51. Lombard-street, and Messrs. Hoares, 37, Fleet-street,
A sum of from £1,000 to £5,000 will be required to accomplish all
that is meditated, towards which the following subscriptions and
donations have already been obtained or promised:—

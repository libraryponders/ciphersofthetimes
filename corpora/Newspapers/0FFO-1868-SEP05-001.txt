Kelly

in each case granted prohibiting the further sale of two works printed
by the defendant Thomas Danks, of Crane-court, Fleet-street, called
respectively "Directorice of Kent and Sussex and o
Berks and Oxon,
such several works having been copied and pirated from the Post
Office Directories of the same counties. The continued publicotion of
similar pirated works not merely causes great loss to Messrs. Kelly
aasmas
the public, one of the above mentioned works having been copied from
a book published by Messrs. Kelly as far back as 1864. And Messrs.
Kelly have determined to take similar proceedings in every case of
phracy from their works, and will feel much obliged to any persons
who will give them information of any such works in progress relating
to these or any other counties.

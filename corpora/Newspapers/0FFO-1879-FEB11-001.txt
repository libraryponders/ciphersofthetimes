FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tain perfeet I REEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 12½s to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
stim more obpectionalne system of compulsory hall-marking, is (lj un¬
Jjust, seeing that ne other sumilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4 contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an isurmountable obstacte to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths' work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensinle by statesmen, political econemists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the Umted Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

CHUBB v. GRIFFITHS.—CAUTION.—Notice is
hereby given, that on the hearing, on the 16th of December,
1865, of the above cause, His Honour the Master of the Rolls granted a
decree making perpetual the injunction which had on the 1st of June
last been granted against the defendant, restraining him from selling
under Messrs. Chubb and Son's name any iron safes not made by
them, and from affixing to any safes not of their manufacture plates
bearing their name. The decree also directed that the defendant
should pay the costs of the suit. All persous are cautioned against
supposing that such safes as may be found to be fitted with Chubb and
Son's locks are therefore necessarily safes of Messrs. Chubb and Son's
manufacture, as it is believed that large numbers of these safes are
sold under false representation, genuine name-plates being removed
from Messrs. Chubb and Son's locks and affixed on the escutcheon or
on some conspicuous part of the safe. Dealers in second-hand fire
proof safes are particularly cautioned against selling, as Messrs. Chubb
and Son's, safes which are not of their manufacture, and against in
any way affixing their names on safes not of their manufacture, and
against allowing any safes professing to be of Messrs. Chubb and Son'
manufacture to pass through their hands without the strictest exami¬
nation; and proceedings in Chancey will in all cases be instituted
when offences of the same or a lic nature are brought to notice.

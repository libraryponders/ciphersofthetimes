IF THIS SHOULD MEET the EYE of Miss MARY
DUNBAR, only child of the late George Dunbar, Esq., who was

brother to the late Captain Charles Dunbar, 10th Regiment, who was
killed in the Indian Mutiny, 1857, her father's sister, Mrs. CECILIA
CARPENTER, implores of her niece to render her some ASSIS¬
TANCE. Mrs. Carpenter's husband, Mr. S. B. Carpenter, solicitor,
has been ill for the last six years and several times a patient in hospi¬
tal. His support, and that of her only child, has devolved on Mrs.
Carpenter, who, from doing work to which she was unaccustomed, has
lost the use of her first finger, right hand. A small sum of money
would enable her husband to resume his profession, and place her in a
position to earn a respectable livelinood, and she feels that her case
would only requige to be known to insure relief. Mrs. Carpenter has
a certificate of her birth, authenticated by R. S. Ireland, M.D., Ste¬
phen's-green, Dublin; and, should further reference be required, any
communication addressed to Mrs. Carpenter, 15, North Summer¬
street, Dublin, will meet with prompt attention. Miss Mary Dunbar
is granddaughter to the late General Baker, 129, Champs Flysées, à
Paris.—May 27th. 1872.

TO the EDITOR of the TIMES.—Sir,—Your
columns are always open to the just complaints of your corre¬
spondents. We feel sure you will not deny a small space to us, for the
more agreeable duty of acknowledging thus publicly the honourable
conduct of the Scottish Union Fire-office, in relation to the late dis¬
astrous fire. We had taken offices at Chamberlain's Wharf for carry¬
ing on our business, and had on the morning of the fire removed the
whole of our (London) stock and books there, but had deferred giving
notice of our change of occupancy until the next business day, which
would be the quarter-day, when we intended renewing our insurance;
but, in the meantime this most calamitous fire burst out, and destroyed
everything but our books. We were aware that we had (by our delay)
lost our legal claim for compensation upon the office, but we submitted
our case to the Board of Directors, who after much consideration have
made us an award, which has saved us from loss. We feel bound to
acknowledge thus publicly our deep sense of gratitude to the Directory
of the Scottish Union Firc-office, for their disinterested kindness
un e e 
rcumstances, and while they were themselve
reat sufferers by this sad calamity. Yours, &c. (HENRI's PATENT

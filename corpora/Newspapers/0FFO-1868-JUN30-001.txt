YOUNG, of Rosetta, as the same may be condescended on, and the
amount ascertained in the said action of Multiplepoinding, paid over
to the persons who may have just right thereto, in terms of the trust
disposition and settlement, and relative letter of bequest, executed by
the said Thomas Young, dated 22d November, 1833, and recorded in
the Books of Council and Session 22d February, 1836. The said Thomas
Young died on 13th February, 1836, survived by his widow, who died on
1st June, 1867, and who was liferented in his estate by virtue of an
antenuptial contract of marriage. Under the fourth purpose of his
said trust disposition and settlement, the said Thomas Young directed
and appointed his trustees, or the survivor of them, to convert the
whole of his means and estate, heritable and moveable, with the ex¬
ception of the bequests therein mentioned, into cash, and so soon
as the same was realized, to divide and pay over the free proceeds,
after deduction of all expenses, to and among the children
of his late brothers. John Young, merchant in Glasgew, and

proportions as his trustees in their judgmene
a td the circumstances
and necessities of the children of his late brothers, and his sisters,
might, by his Trustees, be judged proper and advisable, but declaring
that before any division was made, two sums of £1,000 sterling each
should be set apart and paid over to the parties therein named, to
whom the said Thomas Young thereby legated and bequeathed the
said sums. In which action of Muitiplepoinding, Lord Jerviswoode,
on 9th June, 1868, pronounced the following interlocutor:—"The Lord
Ordinary finds the raiser liable only in one and single payment, and
appoints the dependence of this action to be intimated to the defenders
resident abroad, and other parties who may have any interest in the
fund in medio by advertisement in such papers published abroad as
may be deemed necessary, and once for three weeks in The Times news¬
paper and North British Advertiser. Signed, Charles Baillie." And
his Lordship, on 16th June, 1863, farther pronounced the following
interlocutor:—"The Lord Ordinary appoints claimants on the fund
in medio to lodge condescendences and claims thereon by the second
Box-day in the ensuing vacation. Signed, Charles Baillie." In terms
of the above interlocutors all parties claiming to have an interest in
the trust estate of the said Thomas Young, which constitutes the fund
in medio, are calied on to appear and lodge their claims in said action.

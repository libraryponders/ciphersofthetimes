CAUTION.—WATER FILTERS.—Prevention of
Cholera.—Placing a filter inside a cistern is objectionable, because
it can only be cleaned when the cistern is empty. The use of animal
charcoal alone is also objectionable, because its coarse, granular state
permits animalculs and dirt to pass with the water, and moreover, the
charcoal itself soon becomes foul, and then gives back to the water the
impurities which it had previously taken from it. The only real
purifier of water is the Silicated Carbon Filter, which has been proved
by the Lancet commission to be capable of removing the organic and
saline impurities, and is so constructed as to render the passage of
animalculse physically impossible. Filters for domestic use in all sizes.
Cistern filters (if required) from 12s. 6d. upwards. Main service filters
for purifying large quantities of water. Illustrated price lists an

stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬

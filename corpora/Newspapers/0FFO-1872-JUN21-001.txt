been inuuced to buy it, that to save them from total loss we will
allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Bienfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entail a loss upon ousselves, at the packets will be broken up and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

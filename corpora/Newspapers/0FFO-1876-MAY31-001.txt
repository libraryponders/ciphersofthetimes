useless for me to write. If we had only gone together when I
first suggested it how much happler we should have
.Yo must
go somewhere e e e e

sibly be. I do not like your sentence with theword,"scraped" in it,
a f it was difficult, it was all the more credit. Still  .
taink she is
without affection. You never tell me who you see and what they say
now, 20th July, but if you do anything except write I shall be very
cross. You are right. 1 am perfectly miserable. If we were together
I feel I could and would act exactly as you wished.

but which, in fact, was not their genuine whisky, have been forwarded
from my Stores at Chester, and on my account, in execution of an
order for three hogsheads of their whisky. I had no personal know¬
ledge of the transaction, exceedingly resret it, and am much indebted
to John Jameson and Son for having, after investigating the circum¬
stances, consented to discontinue the proceedings which they had
caused to be instituted against me., 1 paying all costs of, and incidental
to, such proceeding. — Dated this 6th day of October, 1877.

TAXATION of SILVER PLATE.—"The duty
upon silver plate, whether we regard the maknitude of its oppres¬

unprofitableness, its hindrance to trade, its discouragement of art in¬
dustry, or its cconomical unsounduess, must be characterised as one
of the biggest remaining blots in our fiscal system."—Birming¬
ham Daily Post, Friday, January 4, 1878. Buyers of silver plate need
be under no apprehension that the abolition of the duty will in the
slightest degree affect Hall marking, beyond the withdrawal of the

REPEAL of the DUTIES upon GOLD and SILVER PLATE in the
nest Session of Parliamen.

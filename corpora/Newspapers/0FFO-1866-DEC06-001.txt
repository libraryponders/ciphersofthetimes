CAPTAIN MAYNE REID in the BANKRUPTCY
COURT.—There are few who will read this announcement
without pain, especially among the numerous boy readers who have
derived pleasure from the pernsal of Captain Reid's very interesting
books. Among these a Committee has been formed to inquire into the
nature of the embarrassments that beset their favourite author. It is
found that they have arisen from his having become liable for others.
and, moreover, that the assets of his estate far exceed the amount of
his debts. Under these circumstances a subscription was proposed,
but the reply of the gallant Captain leaves no hope that gratuitous aid
would be accepted. The Committee, however, have considered a plan
by which the desired end may be obtained without placing Captain
Reid under the slightest obligation, or in any way touching his suscep¬
tibility. They propose that each of his admirers shall purchase a copy
of his last and greatest work, "The Headless Horseman," a romance
that when read cannot fail to place its author at the head of the novel
writers of the day. The Committee confidently hope that among the
thousands, the hundreds of thousands, who have derived delight and
instruction from Captain Mayne Reid's writings, not a few will respond
to this appeal. Those who desire to do so by forwarding their address,
with a post-office order, to the Secretary, will receive, postage free, a
copy of "The Headless Horseman. The only edition published is in
demy 8vo., splendidly illustrated, price 12s. Address 47, Mortimer¬

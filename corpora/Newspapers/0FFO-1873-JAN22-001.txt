TO OUDEIS, London.—THREE HALF NOTES
RECEIVED, with best thanks, Jan. 21.—R. W
MERMANN to GARRICK. — Health better.
Would be glad to hear from you, and to know you are coming
ELM TREE.—Received with joy. Every word per¬
fection. I do not send packet, not knowing if you can get it
before leaving; let me know. One only I love and care for, and that
one I shall ever respect and revere. The more I learn, the more I long.
I thank God you are quite well; so am I.—Yours for ever
MINE.—I am doing what I believe to be right, so
do not fear for me. But I have no prospects, no friends, no re¬
ligion. This you eught to know. I foresee it will perhaps end all be¬
tween us. By deserting me, my friends have taught me to stand alone
—a great gain. But it is the 
nory of you which keeps me, and will
keep me from despair, though I fear it can never become more than a
memory. Let us not disguise from ourselves that this is writing, but I
am under no promise not to write, and if you have made one I suspect
it ought not to be bin in.

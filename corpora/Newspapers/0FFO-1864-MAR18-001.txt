ANILINE DYES.—Girard's Patent. — Whereas, a suit
having been instituted against me, the undersigned Autoine,
Labore, of Huddersfield, in the county of York, by Messrs. Renard,
Frères et Franc, of Lyons, and Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson
of London, for an INFRINGEMENT by me of GIRARD's PATENT
for blue and violet dies, I submitted to a perpetual injunction issuing
from the High Court of Chancery, to restrain me, my workmen,
and agents, from making and selling or selling any blue or violet dye
made according to the process described in the said patent, and from
otherwise in any manner infringing the said letters patent; and
whereas since the said injunction was awarded, I have made and sold
blue and violet dyes in in fringement of the said letters patent, and
have thereby subjected myself to imprisonment for contempt of the
High Court of Chancery, but at my earnest entreaty the said plain¬
tiffs have abstained for this time only from moving the said Court
for that purpose;—Now therefore I express my regret for having dis¬
regarded the said injunction, and hereby notify that I have discon¬
tinued to make and sell or sell any blue and violet dyes made in
frand of the rights of the said plaintiffs, and I undertake to account
to the said plaintiffs for all profits made by such sales as hereinbefore
mentioned.

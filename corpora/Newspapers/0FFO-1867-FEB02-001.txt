NOTICE.—To Medical Men.—REPRESENTA¬
TION of the REGISTERED PRACTITIONER in the MEDI¬
CAL COUNCIL.—The Medical Council is paid by the entire profes¬
sion, but it is only formed of Crown nominees and delegates from the
diploma and degree giving bodies. It is proposed that a certain num¬
ber of additional members should be sent to the Medical Council, each
representing a constituency of registered medical men, which would
alect for a short term of years their representative. It is considered
that this system would be of immense benefit to the profession, by
giving it a direct interest in the management of its own affairs. A
Council so constituted would also be admirably adapted to render effi¬
cient assistance and advice in sanitary matters to Government, when¬
ever the latter might choose to honour the Council by seeking its opinion.
The Editor of the Medical Mirror (with the co-operation of many
brother medical men) is making arrangements to have a PETITION
presented to Parliament embodying the above suggestions, Registered
medical men anxious to further this object by appending their signa¬
tures are respectfully requested to communicate with the Editor of
the Medical Mirror, 126, Gower-street, London.

orchards, and plantations held therewith, and the Mulbarton-lodge
farm, and cottages and gardens, all which said hereditaments are deli¬
neated on the map No. 370, deposited in the Office of Land Registry as
part of the description of the same hereditaments, and thereon edged
with red, together with the mines and minerals under the same. If
any person objects to, or desire to show cause against, such registra¬
tion, or claims that the same should be subject to any conditions or
reservations, or that any particular estate or incumbrance, charge or
liability, not already proved or admitted before the Registrar, should
be entered on the register, such person may be heard at the Office of
Land Registry, No. 34, Lincoln's-inn-fields, at any time before the ex¬
piration of the said three months, persenally or by his solicitor or
counsel, or by affidavit or otherwise, to make such objection to, or to
show cause against, or to make such claim in respect of, such registra¬
tion. But any person desiring to make such objection or claim must
lodge the same in writing, stating the particulars thereof, and with his
name and address thereto, in the said office, before the expiration of
the said three months, otherwise he will be excluded from making
the same. The aforesaid map may be inspected at the said office at
any time before the expiration of the said three months. —Dated this
2d day of February, 1867.

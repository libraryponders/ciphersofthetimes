ACKNOWLEDGE that the STATEMENT advertised by us that wo

"Gilpin's Patent." We regret having made and published the state¬
ment in question, and make this acknowledgment to Messrs. Gilpin
in consideration of their having consented to stay proceedings in the
action they have commenced against ss. Dated 12th April, 1879.

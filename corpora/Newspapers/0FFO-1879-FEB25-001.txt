FREE TRAD'S in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to obe
perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 1274 to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, secing that no other sumilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principies of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacte to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

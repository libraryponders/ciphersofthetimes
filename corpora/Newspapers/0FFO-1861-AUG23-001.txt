NOURTH ASCENT of the FEMALE
BLONDIN, Monday, August 26.—Royal Cremorne Gardens.—
Mr. E. T. SMITH, the present sole proprietor of CREMORNE, con¬
siders it a duty he owes to his numerous patrons and friends, as well
as to the public in general, to return his most grateful thanks for the
spirited and liberal support given to his inauguration and other
festivals, a support so marked, so brillant, and so expressive, as to
convince him that the course of management he has decided on
is the one the fashionable and general visiting world requires, and
which perhaps these extensive gardens with their vast capabilities

mith, therefore.
idence an
repetition of one of the brillant events which have taken place, and which
has been recognized by the whole Metropolitan press as being marked
by the execution of the greatest feat on record. The Female Blondin
will make her fourth ascent on Monday next, Aug. 26th, precisely at 4
o'clock. The arrangements for the day will be so perfected in the various
departments of the hotel and gardens, and the amusement will

racter and brillancy of a great national holyday. In the hotel
four public saloons will be available for luncheons, dinners, and
suppers, the bills of fare for which will contain every delicacy
of the season, and the wines supplied may be relied upon as
being selected from the finest vintages, and additional private rooms
for families and parties will be in readiness which command a
view of the evening's amusements, and which may be previously se¬
cured upon application or telegram. The amusements and exhibitions
will commence at 3, with promenade music from a military band,
which, with three other bands, are specially engaged for the occasion.

villages and cantons of Fluelen, Amstag, Uri, and Wasen. At inter¬
vals, from 4 to 6, an interesting and talented gymnastic entertainment
will be given by celebrated acrobats and athletes. Elizabethan
dances upon the lawn will be artistically gone through by the ladies
of the ballet en costume, and balloon races will take place. Subse¬

cert will take place, at which comic and sentimental singers

given, principal characters by the Misses Gunniss and Mr. Cormack.
At 8, dancing on the grand crystal platform will commence (the

liantly illuminated) to original music expressly arranged and composed
by Mons. Riviere. The celebrated Leotard, in his graceful and daring

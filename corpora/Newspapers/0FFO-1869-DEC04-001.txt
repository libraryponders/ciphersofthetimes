Solicitor for Juagment Creditors.
TO F. A. P. DALBUQUERQUE, Esq.—Sir.—I
beg to express my regret that, acting without suibcient inquiry
and investigation upon information which I believed at the time to be
correet, 1 made the charge I did against you some short time ago of
having fraudulently obtained from me a cheque for £495 in respect of
a policy covering stores, &c., supplied by you to the Italian ship Ber¬
nard, and which charge having been recently investigated before
Alderman Sir F. G. Moon, at the Mansion-house, was found to be
without foundation. In justice to myself, however, I am bound to add
that in making this charge not only was I acting on information which
I had every reason to believe could be substantiated, but that I took
the course I did entirely on behalf of others, whose interest in the
transaction I represented.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

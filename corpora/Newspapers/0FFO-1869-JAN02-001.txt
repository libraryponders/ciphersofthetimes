Information having reached us that attempts are being made to in¬
duce photographic artists and art publishers to pirate the above

ments or simplifications of the said patent process, but which are, in
reality, mere colourable infringements of the same ; and by offering
for publication and sale reproductions of works of art produced by the
said pretended improvements, and which are, likewise, undoubted
piracies of the said patent; we hereby give notice, that we have re¬
ceived instructions from the assignees of the patent to proceed at law
or in equity, as we may be advised, against all persons practising such
INFRINGEMENTS, whether by the use of the patented process or

we are also instructed to pay to any person or persons who shall supply

was withdrawn:—"I have now pleasure in stating that from the care¬

and property. I can now admit that I much regret having been the
means of his arrest and the consequences to him of the charge pre¬
ferred before the Loid Mayor, on the 4th of November, 1864. Mr.
Wm. Miller is now making satisfactory arrangements for the ultimate
liquidation of his portion of the heavy losses already paid by me.—

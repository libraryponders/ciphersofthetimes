of ecclesjology has led to a general condemnation of the barbarous taste
which formerly prevailed in this respect, and to a desire for the adop¬
tion of more correct forms. The previous edition of this catalogue
having met with so many expressions of approbation, Messrs. Cox and
Son have published this snlarged edition, with a number of new En¬
gravings. As the designs illustrated are executed at Messrs. Cox and
Son's own workshops, they can combine economy of production with
excellency of workmanship and material.—Cox and Son, ecclesiastical

IN MEMORIAM.—To perpetuate the memory of
the departed and to erect a monument that shall stand for all
ages is the wish of every ons, yet how wofully have these good inten
tions been frustrated will be observed by an inspection of the decayed
and obliterated monuments of even recent dates. This need no longer
be the case, for now, in lieu of marble freestone, and wooden
monumental erections, all can have an evetlasting and indestructible
monument in grapite and at prices within the reach of all. The
SHAP and DALBEATTIE GRANITE COMPANY are now able to
supply MONUMENTAL COLUMNS, Obelisks, and headstones in red
and gray granite, of any size and quantity, to all parts of the kingdom.

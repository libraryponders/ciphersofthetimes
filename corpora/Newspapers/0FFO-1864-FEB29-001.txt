largely, and mean no other than Dr. Browne's.—See Times, Jan. 12,
1864. The public, therefore are, cautioned against using any other than
Dr. J. COLLIS BROWNE's CHLORODYNE, which is extensively
used in hospitals at home and abroad, and is affirmed by medical tes¬
timonials accompanying each bottle to be the most efficacious medi¬
cine ever discovered for consumption, coughs, colds, asthma, bron¬
chitis, spasms, rheumatism, &c. No home should be without it. Sold
bottles, 2s. 9d. and 4s. 6d. Sent free, on receipt of stamps, by J.

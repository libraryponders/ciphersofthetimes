FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to obe
perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 129, to 20 per cent. upon articles of dally use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political cconomy; (5 obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

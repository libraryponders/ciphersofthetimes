TO See you suffer, and long vainly to comfort, 1 can¬
not bear. Alone day and night. God knows why this bitter
discipline. It is His, not yours. Don't reproach yourself. I yield to
Him all He withholds, even reputation, though to be held responsible
for all pain and your going seems insupportable. But it lessens the
load, both being there at 8. Must go, for other reasons now, as soon
as way opens. If we ever meet again, it must be His doing, not
tmine.—J.

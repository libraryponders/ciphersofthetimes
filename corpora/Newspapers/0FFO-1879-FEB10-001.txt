FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parlament to obe
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
stim more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, secing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual dimmution of the trade; (3 subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (0) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of cpinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For¬
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

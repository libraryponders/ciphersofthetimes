CAUTION.—Ice Safes or Refrigerators. —Th
WENHAM LAKE ICE COMPANY give notice that eve¬
 REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of their manufacture, bears their nan
and
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felons
NThis notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerod
th-¬
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and r
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fce Con¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tank
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unnece
sary complications, are unequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability
and economy. Sole office, Wenham Lake Ice Company 140 Strand.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised:
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water frem th
rk
block ice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofor
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cay
the tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, andbe
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alon

can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water pass
HE
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filte.
ing Refrigerator alse effects a combination of advantages not to
found in any other ice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injuncti

in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the pat¬
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZIN
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 3156, Oxford-street, London.
CAUTION.—WATER FILTERS.—Prevention
Cholera.—Placing a filter inside a cistern is objectionable, becan
it can only be cleaned when the cistern is empty. The use of anims
charcoal alone is also objectionable, because its coarse, granu sta,
permits animalcukse and dirt to pass with the water, and moreever, th.
charcoal itself soon becomes foul, and thes gives back to the water th
impurities which it had previously taken from it. The only res
er
purifier of water is the Silicated Carbon Filter, which has been prove
of by the Lancet commission to be capable of removing the organic an
saline impurities, and is so constructed as to render the passage
animalculse physically impossible. Filters for domestic use in all size
of Cistern filters (if required) from 12s. 6d. upwards. Main service filter
for purifying large quantities of water. Illustrated price lists an
every information on application to the SILICATED CARBO

REAPER TRIAL.—Having recently arrived from
the United States, I beg again to acknowledge the kind reception
given to my reaping machine of 1851 by the British public, for which
the Council Medal of the Great International Exhibition was then
awarded, and desire to make known to that public, as generally as
practicable during the present harvest, the operation and merits of the
same machine, with my improvements upon it of 11 years, including
the recently invented desideratum of a perfect automatic delivery of
the cut corn in sheaves ready for the binder—so long ineffectually
laboured for. This implement is being exhibited in the present Inter¬
national Exhibition, having obtained the award of the Medal, and the
only one awarded to a single implement in its class. I am authorized
to announce another trial of one of these machines To-morrow (Thurs¬
day), on the well-known farm of Mr. C. Dixon, about three miles
distant from Boxmoor Station, near Hemel Hempstead, on the North¬
Western Railroad, about 20 miles from London. Trains leaving Enston
Station at 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. reach Boxmoor, in less than one hour,
with return trains at 12.43, 3.10, 4.54, and later. Mr. Dixon invites
farmers and others interested to attend.—C. H. M'CORMICK,

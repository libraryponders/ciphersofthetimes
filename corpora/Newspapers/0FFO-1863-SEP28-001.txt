IVERPOOL ART UNION, 1863.—Fourteenth
Season.—Tickets, 1s. each.—Prizes from £5 to £100.—Framed
Chromo-Lithographs of the value of £1 each will also be given as
prizes, in the proportion of 100 to every £1,000 worth of pictures dis¬
tributed.
Important Alteration.—It has hitherto been the custom to limit the
choice of prizeholders to pictures exhibited at

Liverpool Society of Fine Arts. It is now determined that prizeholders
shall have the liberty of selecting their pictures (an advantage not ge¬
nerally accorded by similar societies) from the following Exhibitions:
—London, The Royal Academy: the British Institution; the Society
of British Artists, Suffolk-street; the Old and New Water Colour So¬
cieties, Pall-mall; the Crystal Palace, and the Society of Female
Artists; or from the Provincial Exhibitions of Liverpool, Manchester,
Birmingham, Bristol, Brighton, the sath and West of England Society;
and from the Exhibitions of Dublin and Edinburgh.
In this Art Union every ticket is drawn, thus securing the fairest
possible chance to each subscriber.
It is confidently hoped that the above arrangements will materially
extend the popularity of the Liverpool Art Union (the first shilling
Art Union establishment in England), and that a considerable increase
in the number of subscribers will encourage a continuance of the Socie¬
ty's efforts to foster the growing taste for works of excellence, and to
promote the general interests of art.
The drawing will commence on the 28th of December next. Tickets,
1s. each, may be had of the agents in all parts of England, or of the
secretary, on forwarding stamps or money order for the number re¬
quired.

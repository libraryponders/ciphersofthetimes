Freres et Franc, of Lyons, and Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson

from the High Court of Chancery, to restrain me, my workmen,
and agents, from making and selling or selling any blue or violet dye
made according to the process described in the said patent, and from
otherwise in any manner infringing the said letters patent; and
whereas since the said injunction was awarded, I have made and sold
blue and violet dyes in in fringement of the said letters patent, and
have thereby subjected myself to imprisonment for contempt of the
High Court of Chancery, but at my earnest entreaty the said plain¬
tiffs have abstained for this time only from moving the said Court
for that purpose;—Now therefore I express my regret for having dis¬
regarded the said injunction, and hereby notify th

fraud of the rights of the said plaintiffs, and I undertake to account

CAUTION.—In reply to the numerous inquiries
respecting the real sources of production of the genuine unsophis¬
ticated waters from the fiscal Mineral prings of the Government
District, Wiesbaden, and in order to prevent the often occurring com¬
plaints on behalf of adulterated, ungenume SELTERS WATERS, we¬
the undersigned, respectfully beg to direct the attention of the public,
to the following particutars:—
 1. Orders for Waters, from all the fiscal Mineral Springs of the Go
vernment District, Wiesbaden, may be directed in urst instance to
the undersigned Committee of the Royal Prussian Springs at Nieder¬
selters; further, the administration of the Royal Springs at Fachingen,
Ems, Langenschwaloach, Weilbach, and Geilnau, also the warehouse
of the Royal Mineral Waters at Ehrenbreitstein, are prepared to re¬
ceive and promptly to execute all orders directed to them.
2. In order to ascertain and to verity the genuineness of the said
Mineral Waters, it is especially recommended to see whether the jars
in the trade, purporting to be filled with our Mineral Waters, bear the
right jar stamp, which on the selters—Fachinger's and Geilnan's jars
—has an heraldic Adler in the midst of the escutcheon, while on the
Ems jars there is a crowned N, surrounded by the following inscrip¬
tion:—"Selters-Nassau, Fachingen, Geilnau, resp. Emser-Kranches
Water or Emser Kessel Water." Further, the stopping metallic caps
to the jars and bottles bear the inscription of the name of the springs
around the cagle, and further, on the outer pearl boarder of these
caps, the name, in diamond letters, of the firm. Staniol and Metallic
Caps Factory at Wiesbaden. Observe too the brand mark on the side

3. The pure natural waters of the abovenamed mineral springs are

(a) At Niederselters and Ems in whole and half stone jars, con
taining 15-16th and 21-32nd of a French litre, also in whole and half
litre glass bottles.
(b) At Fachingen and Geilnau, in whole and half stone jars, also
whole glass bottles, but on the contrary,
(c) At Langensehwalbach and Weilbach, in whole and half litre
glass bottles only.
The glass bottles are duly labelled, ascertaining thus the authen¬
ticity of their contents.
. Applications for lozenges made from the salts of the fiscal
Mineral Springs are to be directed, in the first instance, to the Royal
Bath Admmistration at Bath, Ems.
All the leading merchants trading in Mineral Waters are prepared
to receive orders for the above named Mmneral Waters and Lozenges.
Price lists and prospectuses on the jointly fiscal Mineral Waters are

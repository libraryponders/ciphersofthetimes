nor become bent in the use. They are charged 1d. per umbrella or
parssol more than the frames of other makers, S. Fox and Co.'s patent
pebble tips, being used only as a trade mark to denote their special
manufacture, are charged without profit. They are of extreme strength
and durability, and will last as long as the frames.—S. Fox and Co.,

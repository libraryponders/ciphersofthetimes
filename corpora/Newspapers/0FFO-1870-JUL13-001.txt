articles of their guaranteed manufacture are distinctly stamped with
their trade mark, E. and Co., under a srown, in a shield—the represen¬
tation now so frequently made, that articles, often of the most inferior
description, are plated by Elkington and Co.'s
ocess, is entirely value
less as a criterion of quality. In the case of "Ekington v. Johnson,"
recently tried before Vice-Chancellor James, defendant having unlaw¬
fully used their marks, a perpetual injunction was granted restraining
defendant from using or imitating their name or trade marks; and

"London, June 16th, 1870.
"Gentlemen.—I deeply regret having caused you the trouble to de.
fend your patent rights and to institute   ¬
coe enenigs against me¬

 a e e recently obtained
my solict.
, Messrs. Plews and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed
to pay your costs. 1 have aiso directed an account to be prepared of
all consignments I have made to the colonies up to the date of the
injunction. These will, as speedily as possible, be furnished to you, as
well as a statement of all rug paletots that have been made by me in
contravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest should be determined by some London or colonial
rchant to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
""I hope that you will do me the justice to believe that, previous to the
commencement of litigation between us. I sincerely thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact configuration described in your speci¬
fieation and drawing attached to the patent. I, therefore, did not
imagine that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counsel
claimed it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such. I
now understand, consists in the formation of material into a garment,
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, so that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the knowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of dumnages, i have no
objection to your publishing this letter.

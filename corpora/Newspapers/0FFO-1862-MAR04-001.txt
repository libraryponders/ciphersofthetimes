TEMPLE-BRIDGE COMPANY.—An advertise¬
ment has appeared in the newspapers of a proposal to incorporate
a company for constructing a carriage bridge from Essex-Street, Strand,
to Princes-street, Upper Stamford-street, being (as stated in the adver¬
tisement) "one of the sites reported by the Select Committee on
Metropolitan Bridges, 1854, as demanding bridge accommodation" and
stating that immediate steps will be taken to obtain an Act of Parlia¬
ment. The direct course of a bridge on this site would take a con¬
siderable part of Princes-wharf, on the Lambeth side, and would so
seriously interfere with the trade carried on there that the lesse and
occupier of the wharf has thought it right to express his intention of
offering every lawful opposition to any such undertaking, and opposing
any application by Parliament for compulsory powers, and, as the
property belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, of secking the assistance of
the Council of the Duchy to support the interest of their lessee; and if,
notwithstanding such opposition, Parliament should think fit to grant
compulsory powers for the undertaking, it would most probably be
necessary to require the promoters to purchase the whole of the wharf.

site is not among the sites mentioned in the report of the Select Com¬
mittee of 1854, as requiring bridge accommodation, and in the evidence
annexed to the report this site is mentioned by only one of the several
engineers who were examined, viz Mr. Tite, who, in page 88, mentions
it in this way, viz.:—"Another bridge might be placed somewhere
about Essex-street; that perhaps is not so pressing a necessity. This
bridge would start from the middle of the Strand. And again, in
page 89, he says:—"I believe that the bridge opposite Essex-street,
which I propose to be a suspension bridge, might be built for £150,000."

CAVEAT.—SIDREAL VIS MOTRIX: Systematic
Ventiation, Posuive and Universa i n oen
polication.—The under¬
signed, excuusive originator and inventor of "Thiers' Universal Auto¬
matic Ship Ventilator Alarm and Bilge-Pump," fully accepted and en¬
dorsed as to principle by the most reliable and experienced scientific
attaches of the American and English Navies, begs to announce that
he has devised an invaluable improvement in the adaptation and ap¬
plication of the aforesaid to all sea-going vessels, wuereby the cutting
of decks and the bulky requirements of large tanks or cylinders are
wholly obyiated, reducing the expense of apparatus to a moiety of that
of the crude mechanical nevice tilus far imperrectly applied. As a most
happy analogue and congener of the simple flnid-piston, operating by
the undulation of the seas, by which positive ship ventilation is accom¬
plishe, the undersigned has happily devised the grand desideratum of
a rotary iever (sidreal vis motriz), through which the economy of
natural forees is utilized in a manner whereby the largest public
or private builnings may be thoroughly and positively ventilated for
a few pence per diem, forming, at the same time, a comparatively ex¬
penteless and ever-ready motor for all light mechanical requirements.
.To a comprehensive development of the latter, and so far as his
interest may be proven to exist in the former, and commensurate
with the world-wide ranitary importance of each, the undersianed
cordially solicits the aid and CO-OPERATION of a GENTLEMAN—
not in the threadbare acceptation of the term, but rather a party of
probity and principle, whoily untrammeled by the equivocal pouticai
exigencies of the period—and to such an one, having a slight spnce of
God's humanity left in his nature, by far the largest share of pecuniary
resusts will be cheerfully accomed. Andress per letter only, Wm. F.
J. hiers, M.D., Stevens House, New York City. N.B. Responses
from intangible parties and quid nunes disregarded.

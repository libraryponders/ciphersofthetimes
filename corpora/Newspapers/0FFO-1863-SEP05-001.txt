A POLOGY.—To Messrs. JEFFREY and Co., of the
Kent and Essex yard, High-street, Whitechapel, paperstainers.
—We sincerely regret that, by an error of one of our clerks, the name
of your firm was inserted in the List of Bankrupts, published in The
Stationer of the 10th of August last. There was no foundation what¬
ever for such a statement. The mistake arose from the fact of your
being petitioning creditors to a person named Tollervey and we are
much annoyed that you should have had any trouble or felt any incon¬
venience arising from the statement before alluded to. —Dated this 3d
day of September, 1863.		The EDITOR of The STATIONER.
Witness—Thos. Harrison, jun., solicitor, 5, Walbroo

CAUTION.—MAIZENA.—The immense success
ofthis article has brought unprincipled persons into the market
with imitations copying from The Times, &c., the notices given the
Maizena. There is but one true Maizena, and this received, of all
competing articles, the only Prize Medal of the Exhibition, 1862, and
was also reported by the jury excedingly excellent for food. Every
genuine packet has our name thereon. Circulators of the frandulent
will be prosecuted, the name Maizena being protected by law.—

Kingdom.

ing vessels, 2ft. 10in., 25s.; 5ft. 6in., £2 12s. 6d. Warranted to go

of a vessel, and the largest ship could be rendered invisible by a dense

NEW ACHROMATIC MAGIC and DISSOLV¬
ING LANTERNS.—The want of brillancy having been always
a great complaint with magic lanterns, Messrs. S. have discovered a
great improvement, which overcomes this difficulty, and which can be
supplied at their usual low prices, being much lower than the prices of the
ordinary non achromatic lanterns of other houses. This important stride
is obtained by substituting for the common non-achromatic lens (now in
use) a pure first class achromatic lens. It must be understood that the
addition of such an improvement is a great increase in the expense of
the manufacture of the lantern; but Messrs. S. do not rise their price
in anticipation of a large sale. Persons are invited to apply for a
catalogue, sent free.—S. and B. SOLOMONS, opticians to the Govern¬
ment, 39, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly.

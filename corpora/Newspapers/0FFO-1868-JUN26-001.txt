CHARLIE, do write to vour boy and let him know
your address.
BRISTOL.—I require further information. Address

—Your note not sufficiently explicit. Could not
conceive how to send a f. 1. Could have forwarded a

to do so. Dreadfully alarmed at being thought "so
pointed." God bless you.—Z.
EAR TOM.—Pray send me your whereabouts,
that I may write you. Direct as before, King's-road, Brighton.
Why on earth do you remain in London? Brighton is deliciously cool
and lodgings remarkably cheap.
WITHOUT news, but hope for the best. Things
remain unchanged; ever vividly present in memory and affec¬
tion, and much missed. Have put in a previous notice, and shall be

glad to write in detail.
fidence and think of me as yours
ever faithful and unalterable.—O. W. L.—25 June.

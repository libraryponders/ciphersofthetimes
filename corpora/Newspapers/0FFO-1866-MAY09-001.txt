OUR SUBURBAN RESIDENCE.—Private Cha¬
racter.—(A representation has been made to us that the article
entitled "Our Suburban Residence" (see No. 265 of ALL THE YEAR
ROUND) is not pure fichon, as it purported to be, and as we believed
it to be, but has in it some colouring of distorted fact, caiculated to
misrepresent and injure an amiable and useful gentleman. We be¬
lieve this representation to be strictly true, and we profoundly regret
the publication of the article, though no Editor can possibly guard
himself at all times against such deception. In making this repara¬
tion for our own innocent part in the wrong done, we publish the
author's letter on the subject.
"To the Conductor of "All the Year Round.—Dear Sir.—I beg to
acknowledge the receipt of your communication informing me that Dr.
Laseron, of Upper Edmonton has taken exception to a paragraph in
the article entitled  Our Suburban Residence," published in No. 365 of
your journal, dated the 21st of April last; of which unlucky article
I am the writer, and which you accepted and published as a piece of
fiction. Dr. Laseron considering himself satirised or aimed at in that
paragraph, under the mask of a certain imaginary personage called
Zoller, I have no hesitation in avowing that I am exceedingly sorry for
it. I never intended to impute any fraudulent conduct or motives even
to that purely mythical personage: far less to Dr. Laseron whom I
never saw in my life, and with whom I never held any communication
whatever, direct or otherwise. Though conscious under these circum¬
stances of the impossibility of my having been actuated by any malevo¬
lent foeling towards Dr. Laseron, I still deeply regret to have given him
offence, and I hope he will accent my apology for having unfortunately
done so, as freely and fully as I hereby offer it. I do not seek to make
reparation by halves, and I feel that I have no right to object to my
apology being published.—I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully, The Writer
of the Article "Our Suburban Reside.

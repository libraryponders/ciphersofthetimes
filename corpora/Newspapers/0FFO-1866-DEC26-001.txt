TABLE CROQUET. —Extract from the Field, Oct.
20, 1866:—"One plan is to affix weights to the hoops (loaded
arches), but weighted hoops are very liable to be knocked over or dis¬
placed, and the weights interfere greatly with the course of the balls.
In Cavendish's improved patent table croquet, the legs are so contrived
as to hold the hopes of a raise,
a place, and yet they do not interfere with
the running of the balls. We think we shall not be far wrong if we
prophesy this croquet will command a large sale."—Sole agents

tution).

President—H.R.H. the Princess CHRISTIAN of SCHLESWIG¬
HOLSTEIN (Princess Helena of Great Britain and Ireland).
Visitor—The Bishop of London.
The Adult Orphan Institution, in the future to be known as the
Princess Helena College, was established in 1820 for the Education, as
Governesses, of the orphan daughters of clergymen, and officers of the
Army, Royal Navy, and Marines.
The change of name recently decided upon was accompanied by im¬
portant alterations in the laws of the Institution, made with a view
of placing its uncertain revenue upon a securer basis, and extending
the sphere of charity which, though working within narrow limits, has
heen proved to be emmently valuable by the experience of more than
bal, a century. The primary objects of the Charity have been care¬
fully kept in sight, and the proposed alterations are intended to aid
and develope rather than to displace the design of the original
eeetinussumesenesemare
Charity the orphan daughters of members of the higher grades of Her
Majesty's Civil Service. (2.) To provide for the reception of young
ladies, between the ages of 1s and 21, to reside in the collese as pay¬
ing students. (3.) To establish da e
e o
ge f r irls
SSSS.
over the age of eight, daughters of gentlemen resident in the neigh¬
borhoo.
In order to carry out these changes in a manner suited to the re¬
quirements of modern education, a large addition to the buildings of
the college will be necessary, the estimated cost of which, including
incidental outgoings, is about £5,500.
The Council confdently appeal to the public for their assistance in
raising this sum.
ievery donation of £5 5s., either to the building fund or to the gene¬
eech
ral fund of the college, entitles the donor for life to one vote;
election of orphans. Every annual subscription of 10s. 6d. entitles

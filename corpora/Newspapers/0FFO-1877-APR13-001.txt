ST. JOHN the BAPTIST-UPON-WALBROOK.—At
 VESTRY MEETING of the Inhabitants of this Parish, held
on the 5th April, 1877, it was resolved unanimous l y
That this Vestry desires to express its extreme dissatisfaction at the
enormous and iereasing amount of the annual expenditure upon the
rehef of the poor of the Metropolis. While this Vestry does not grudge
any outlay necessary for the ample relief and support of the neces¬
sitous, the disabled, the sick, and the imbecile poor, from information
laid before it, and upon which it can rely, it is compelled to conclude
that, particularly in the item of providing additional house room, the
present administration of the law is characterized by an entire absence
of a due regard both for economy and for the real convenience of those
for whom shelter has to be provided, as well in the selection of sites
as in the character of the buildings erected upon them.
It was also resolved, that the above resolution be inserted in The
Times and the City Press newspapers.

FACT versus FICTION.—1st., The Sun's Distance;
2d. The Stability of the Earth.—Fact 1st. I have for years ob¬
served, at noon, when 50 degrees north of the sun's perpendicular, the
shadow of any perpendicular substance is as long on a plane hase as
the substance is high. This fact clearly proves the distance of the sun
is not as many thousand miles as medern thition says tis millions. I
hereby challenge the modern scientific to show how it is possible for
such amount of shadow to appear, if the sun's distance was more than
six times the earth's diameter, the earth being a globe. Fact 2. It is a
well-known fact, when an eclipse of the sun cccurs the dark body of the
moon appears to the eye of an observer to pass over the sun's dise from
west to east. This fact proves that the carth does not turn daily be¬
fore the sun. I challenge the aforenamed to show the possibility of
the earth's turning once in 24 hours. The moon travelling round the
earth only once in 29 days, the sun stationary, and the cllpse not to
appear to an observer to pass from east to west before the sun.—J.

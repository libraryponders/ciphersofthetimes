THE GREAT MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM
SOLVED.—A Friendly Caution to Mathematicians, Professors,
and Teachers not to persist in Error.—The number in general use,
3.141,592,653,869 carried on with hundreds of decimal fract ons, is con¬
fessedly admitted to be only a near approximation to the true, hitherto
ungnown measure of the circumference of the circle. By my new
method of employing lines and cireles in motion I demonstrate the
true measure of the circumference, area, and quadrature of the circle.
This grand discovery was published by Thomas Kell, 40, King-street,
Covent-garden, and advertised in The Times dated 17th, 20th, and 22d
of July, 1875. The demonstration has been two years before the nation
and the world. It is surely time that this discovery should be univer¬
sally adopted, and the present erroneous measure of the circumference
cease to be taught in all colleges and schools, or employed by astro¬
nomers in computing the distance of the carth from the sun. The
tenor of some recent publications impels me to give this friendly cau¬
tion. I invite communications, and am ready to confirm by freshly
constructed examples the absolute truth of my new method of
employing lines and crcles in motion.—DANIEL WEST, Discoverer
of the Quadrature of the Circle by Demonstration, 69, Euston-square,
London, March 29, 187.

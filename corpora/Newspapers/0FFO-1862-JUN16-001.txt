CAUTION.—In the matter of Fields' Paraffine
Candles.—Whereas, Messrs. J. C. and J. FIELD, of Lambeth,
were the original manufacturers in England of PARAFFINE
CANDLES, and have, after a long and costly series of experiments
succeeded in producing paraffine candles free from colour, odour, and
greasiness; and whereas their process has been examined and favour¬
ably reported upon by scientific men of high repute, and has also been
noticed with approval in many of the public journals, and Messrs.
J. C. and J. Field are now commonly considered the manufacturers of
paraffine candles; and whereas candles of inferior paraffine, and
candles composed in part only of paraffine, are being introduced into
the London and other markets under the designation of paraffine, and
it is apprehended the same may be confounded with the article manu¬
factured by Messrs. J. C. and J. Field, of Lambeth; Notice is hereby
given, that all persons desiring to purchase the paraffine candles manu¬
factured by Messrs. Field according to the process reported on by Dr.
Letheby (see Money Article in The Times of 8th January, 1862), should
be careful to procure them either in boxes or wrappers bearing the
names of "J. C. and J. Field, Lambeth;" and legal proceedings will
be taken against all persons offering to sell as "Field's Paraffine
Candles," candles not of their manufacture. —Dated this 24th day of

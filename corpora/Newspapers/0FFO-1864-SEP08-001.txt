CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements appear daily, stating that the
dvertisers can reproduce carte de visite portraits, I, CAMILLE
SILVY (as far as I am concerned), CAUTION all persons against such
proceedings, which infringe the acts for protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to se¬
cure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number); and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

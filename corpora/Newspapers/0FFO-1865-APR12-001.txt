EDITORIAL, written by ROBERT HOGG, LL.D.,
F.L.S.:—"The HYDROPULT.—The great secret of successful in¬
door gardening consists in the free and judicious use of the syringe. A
greenhouse or conservatory that does not enjoy this luxury becomes a
miserable lazar house of vegetable incurables. Vermin and filth hold
unbounded sway, and people become disgusted with their own want of
success. We regard the introduction of the free use of the syringe as
one of the events in modern gardening. To this is due the success of
orchard house management, vine management, and plant manage¬
ment; but the old syringe, with its slow suck and squirt, is now as much
out of date in modern gardening as an old stage waggon in modern lo¬
comotion. Many are the improvements and complications of the old
simple syringe. We have tried several of them, but for ease in working
and efficiency in result we have not yet met with anything to equal
the hydropult sent us by Mr. Button. It is powerful in opera¬
tion, and so easy and comfortable to work that one never gets fatigued.
With such an instrument plants may be kept in (perfect health and
quite free from insects and dirt. We first tried it on a few geraniums
in our conservatory, which were smothered with green fly during our
tomporary absence of ten days; but, on our return, a stout discharge
from the hydropult sent them clean off across some unknown bourne,
whence they have never yet returned." Hydropult for the garden,
greenhouse and conservatory, 43s., including packing-case. Each ma¬
chine has 22 feet suction and 3 feet delivery hose strainer, rose, and
small jet.—CHARLES POMEROY BUTTON, 142 and 143, Cheapside

commercial centre of the oity of London. It comprises an extensive
suite of apartments specially adapted to meet the wants of ladies and
gentlemen who may have occasion to visit the city; and while space
and comfort have been carefully studied, special efforts have been
made to introduce in the decoration peculiar features of artistic
excellence, and to bring together some novel exemplifications of
modern decorative art. On the railway platform an elegant buffet

parties, a smoking divan, and lavatories for gentlemen. The culinary
department contains every recent improvement, and the great roast¬
ing apparatus for cooxing in front of the fire is in itself a curiosity.
This department is on the upper floor. In every instance Spiers and
Pond have devoted studious care to the aim that the visifor shall not
only dine well and economically, but that he shall also dine plea¬
santly.

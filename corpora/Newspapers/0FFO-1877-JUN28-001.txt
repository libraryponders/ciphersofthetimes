HETTY to WILLIE.—Am back in town. Please

write or call soon. I wish to see you
—You sorely distress me. I am not by any means
indifferent to you. For you to write is to confer honour—on
my side it would be presumption. I appointed a place of meeting,
but you never came. I wrote you my address, and made application
for letters, but no answer was forthcoming. Confidence for confidence
is all I ask. A word from you can at any moment end this painful
suspense. You will find me most obedient.—

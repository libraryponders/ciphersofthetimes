pose, or keep for sale, or or to export, or to attempt to export from
England any pistols, rifles, breech-loading guns, or small arms of any
kind, the barrel or barrels whereof are not duly proved, and marked as
proved, pursuant to the Gun-barrel Proof Act, 1855. Barrels of foreign
make imported into England are liable to the provisions of the said
Act. Offenders are liable to a penalty of £20 for each offence, and

POLOGY.—To the Guardians of the Birmingham
Gun-barrel Proofhouse.—Gentlemen.—I, the undersigned, Isaac
Lowthime, of No. 8, Bull-ring, Birmingham, pawnbroker, do hereby
express my REGRET at having infringed the provisions of the Gun¬
barrel Proof Act, 1855, by selling to Mr. John Summers, of Tanworth,
a gun, the barrels of which had received only provisional and not defi¬
nitive proof; at the time I sold this gun I was not aware that any other
proof was requisite than that which appeared upon the barrels, but I
find that selling the gun without the mack of definitive proof on the
barrels has rendered me liable to a penaity of £20. I thank the Board
for its leniency in not pressing the case aguinst me, and I shall willingly
pay the costs incurred, including the insertion of this apology once in
each of the Birmingham newspapers, also the costs of properly proving
the barrels of the gun, and if they do not stand proof I will make
good the loss to Mr. Summers.
I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant
(Signed)

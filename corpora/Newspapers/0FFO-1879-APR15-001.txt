HEKTOGRAPH, incomparable MULTIPLYING
APPARATUS.—By His Imperial Majesty's Royal Letters
Patent.—The HEKTOGRAPH is admirably adapted for lawyers,
stewards, notaries, public officers, parish officials, banks, engineers,
musicians, business men, &c. Has been thoroughly tested, and is
strongly recommended by all the most celebrated journals in Europe,
and allowed to be a most practical invention. It does away entirely
with the constant copying by hand. The manipulation is most simple,
and any sort of paper can be used. The manuscript to be copied
must be laid on the composition contained in a metal box; the
writing is at once taken up by the mass; then remove the manuscript,
which must be replaced by the paper to which the writing is to be
transferred; pass the paim of the hand gently over the paper, and in
this manner plans, music, letters, drawings, &c., can be struck off-60
to 80 copies in from 10 to 15 minutes, according to the dexterity of the
manipulator. As soon as the necessary number have been copied, the
writing must be rubbed off the mass, and it is at once ready for
further use. Chief depot for all Europe, at JOSEF LEWITUS'S,
Vienna, I. Babenbergerstrasse No. 9. Copies and samples sent gratis
and prepaid. Applications by letter instantly attended to. Warning.—
This apparatus is patented in all countries. Beware of spurious imita¬
tions. The apparatus may be seen at Rudolf Mosse's International

"Gentlemen,— I deeply regret having caused you the trouble to de¬
fend your patent rignts and to institute legal proceedings against me¬
In compliance with the injunction which vou have recently obtained,
my solicitors, Messrs. Plews and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed
to pay your costs. I have also directed an account to be prepared of

onies up to the date of the
injunction. Toese will, as speedily as possibre, be furnished to you, as
well as a statement of all rug paletots that have been made by me in
contravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest sheald be determined by some London or colonial
merchant to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
1 hope that you will do me the justice to believe that, previous to the
commencement of litigation between us, I sincerely thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact configuration described in your speci¬
fication and drawing attached to the patent. I, therefore, did not
smagine that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counsel
claimed it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such. I
now understand, consists in the formation of material into a garment.
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, so that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the knowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towands me on the question of damages, 1 have no

I remain, yours, &c., S. MAURY.

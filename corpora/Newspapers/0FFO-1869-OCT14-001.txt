awakened to the advantage of this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to pass off clumsy
imitations for that which D. Nicoll and Co. have already proved
to be the cheapest article ever offered to the public. The safeguard
will be the right to demand to see the trade mark, which may be thus
described: the Coats of Arms of London and Paris are printed or
woven on to a loop used for hanging up the garment, and between
these emblems of the two cities, the words "Nicoll's Patent " appear.

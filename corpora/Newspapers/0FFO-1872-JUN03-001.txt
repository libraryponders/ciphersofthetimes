right of rating lands. Therefore, propreerors, agents, and other per¬
sons to whom this notice is addressed, are particularly requested to
examine the sketch maps, to ascertain that the boundaries of those
lands in and for which they are interested have been correctly defined
and sam down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for com¬
parison with the boundary sketch maps, that, should any differences
be found, they may be inquired into and corrected before the maps are

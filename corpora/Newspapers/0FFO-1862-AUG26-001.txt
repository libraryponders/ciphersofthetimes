Cheese Richardson, Superintendent of the Province of Otago, in the
Colony of New Zealand. —Whereas, by Section No. 9 of "The Diseased
Cattle Act, 1861," passed by the General Assembly of New Zealand in
Parliament assembled, it is enacted that "If at any time it shall be
made to appear to the Governor that any infectious or contagions dis¬
ease has broken out in any district aut of the colony, it shall be lawful
for the Governor, by Order in Council, to declare that such district is
infected within the meaning of this Act, and from time to time to
make such regulations as to him shall seem fit for prohibiting the im¬
portation of cattle into the colony from such district, and the landing
or driving of such cattle, and for destroying cattle imported, landed, or
driven contrary to such regulations;" and by Section 10 of the same
Act, it is also cnacted that "If at any time it shall be made to appear to
the Governor that any infectious or contagious disease has broken out
amongst cattle in any district of the colony, it shall be lawful for the
Governor, by Order in Council, to declare that such district is infected
within the meaning of this Act, and from time to time to make such re¬
gulations for dastroying discased cattle therein, and for prohibiting the
removal or transportation of cattle from one part of the colony to
another, and for preventing the further spread of such disease as to
him shall seem fit." And it is by the same Act also enacted that the
Governor in Councll may by warrant under his hand, from time to
time, delegate to the Superintendent of any Province within the colony,
all or any of the powers vested in the Governor or Governor in Council
by the said Act, subject to such regulatiens as he may think fit, and
may from time to time rescind such delegation; and whereas the Go¬

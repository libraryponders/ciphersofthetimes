F. M.—(Supplementary Description.)—In a Germang
capital has arrived a young English lady, apparently between 18
and 13 years of age, destitute and without friends. She is tall, very
slight, and good looking, having short, dark hair and very dark eyes,
short teeth. The circumstances that her head has been recently shaved,
her great dread of being brought back to England, where she claims
relationship with noble families, and her eccentric conduct, lead to the
supposition that she has escaped the care of friends in this country;
hence this advertisement. INFORMATION as to her identity will be
gratefully received by Mr. Pollaky, 13. Padding ton-green.

sion renders the sale of the starch made by the defendant illegal, and
will subject the seller of it to a penaity of £40,000. We beg to inti¬
mate to those who may have been induced to buy it, that to save
them from total loss we will allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Glen¬
field Starch Works. Paisley, in exchange for the genuine article, at
the current price. This will entail a loss upon ourselves, as the packets
will be broken up and sold for waste starch, but it will at the same time
be the means of rendering the article useless for further deception.
Any information that will lead to conviction will be rewarded.

THE FIRST COURT of MAYOR and ALDER¬

city of London, on Tuesday, the 13th day of November, 1866, and in
the 30th year of the reign of Victoria, of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland Queen, &c. Resolved unanimously:
That the sincere and heartfelt thanks of this Court be presented to
the Right Hon. Benjamin Samuel Phillips, late Lord Mayor, for the
highly efficient and dignified manner in which he has so satisfactorily
discharged the many and important duties of the high office of Chief
Magistrate of this city.
That this Court is desirous of expressing at the same time its deep
sense of the energy displayed by him in taking measures for the relief
of the sufferings of his fellow creatures in all parts of the world, and
more especially under the recent outbreak of cholera in this metro¬
polis, and for the prompt and efficient measures which were taken
under his guidance, and which not only tended to the alleviation of the
sufferings of the dying, but to secure provision for the widows and
o phans of those who had perished under the calamitous visitation.
At the same time, this Court cannot but acknowledge in the warmest
terms the great satisfaction they feel, in common with their fellow¬
citizens, at the distinguished compliment paid to the city of London,
and to the Lord Mayor as its chief magistrate, by the King and Queen
of the Belgians, their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the
Duke of Edinburgh, and other eminent persons, and the admirable
manner in which the late Lord Mayor exercised his important func¬
tions on those several occasions.
This Court is also anxious to express the hope that he may long con¬
tinue to exercise, for the benefit and advantage of the Corporation and
the citizens of London, the talents and qualifications which have ele¬
vated him to the high position he holds in the esteem and regard of
his friends and fellow-countrymen.

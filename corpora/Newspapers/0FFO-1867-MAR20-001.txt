METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENT RATE.—
"To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor—My Lord,—We,
the undersigned citizens and rated inhabitants of the City of London.
beg leave to direct the attention of your Lordship to the provisions of
a Bill introduced into Parliament, called the Metropolitan Improve¬
ment Bill, which seeks to impose a special and additional rate of
fourpence in the poand upon the owners and occupiers of property in
the metropolis, including the City of London and liberties. We are
not unaware of the necessity which exists for further improvements
in London, and particularly in the crowded streets of the City, but we
are not prepared to sauction unconstitutional and novel modes of
texation for the purpose of securing such improvements. While we
object to many of the details of the Bill, we desire to specify as parti¬
cularly inexpedient and obnoxious the provisions which it contains,
whereby it inflicts a tax within the City, but withholds from the duly¬
elected representatives of the citizens the control hitherto exercised
over the expenditure of their own rates—a power which is rightly
conferred upou every other city and town in the kingdom. We there¬
fore respectfully request that your Lordship will call a public meeting
of the citizens and rated inhabitants at an early day to take steps for
opposing the passing of the said Bill, and we shall be further obliged
by your Lordship presiding at such meeting.
In compliance with the foregoing Requisition, signed by 900 citizens
and rated inhabitants of the City of London, I hereby convene a
PUBLIC MEETING of the Citizens and Ratepayers, to be held in the
Guildhall, THIS DAY, the 20th March, 1867, at 2 o'clock precisely,
for the purpose of opposing the passing of the "Metropolitan Im¬
provement Bill."

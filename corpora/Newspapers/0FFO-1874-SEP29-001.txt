POLOGY from the PRESS ASSOCIATION
(Limited) to Messrs. PIERS and POND:—We (the Press
Assuciation) have to express our deep regret that, owing to the indis¬
cretion of a suboromnate, and during the absenc from London of the
manager, we were a few days ago mhade the medium of circulating a
rumour detsimental to the credit of Messrs. Spiers and Pond, the well¬
knovn refreshment contractors. We make the lullest reparation in
our nower by stating that there was not one title of foundation for
the rumour in question, and that the best porsime proof of ths hes in
the fact that the hom was abundantly able to sustain the simultaneous
shock which reached it from every quarter to which our paragraph
penetrated. We trust that thit disclamer will remove from the
public mind any simsser views which our previous paragraph may have
produce concerning theereeit of Messr. Sters and Pond.

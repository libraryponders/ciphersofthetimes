CAVEAT.—SIDREAL VIS MOTRIX: Systematic
Ventilation, Porive and Universal in Application.—The under¬
signed, exclusive origmator and inventor of "Thiers' Universal Auto¬
matc Ship Ventilator Alarm and Bilge-l ump," fulry accepted and en¬
dorsed as to principle by the most reliable and enperienced scientific
attaches of the American and English Navies, begs to announce that
he has devised an invaluable improvement in the adaptation and ap¬
plication of the aforesaid to all sea-going vessels, whereby the cutting
of decks and the bulky requrements of large tanks or cylinders are
wholly obmated, reducing the expense of apparatus to a moiety of that
of the crune mechnaical nevice thus tar impertectly applied. As a most
happy analogue and congener of the simple flnid-piston, operating by
the undulation of the seas, by which positive ship ventilation is accom¬
plished, the undersignes has happily devised the grand desideratum of
a rotary lever (sidreal vis motrix), through which the coonomy of
natural forces is utilized in a manner whereby the largest public
or private buildings may be thoroughly and positively seutiiaten for
a few pence per diem, forming, at the same time, a consparatively ex¬
pen eless and ever-ready motor for all light mecnameal requirements.
To a comprehlensive devecopment of the latter, and so far as his
interest may be proven to exist in the former, ann commensurate
with the world-wine sanitary importance of each, the undersianed
cordially solicits the ai and CO-OPERATION of a GENTLEMAN—
not in the threadbare acceptation of the term, but rather a party of
probity and principle, who ly untrammeled by the equivocal political
exigencies of the period—and to such an one, having a slight spice of
Goa's humanity left in his nature, by far the largest share of pecuniary
results will be cheerfully accordeds Address per letter only, Wm. F.

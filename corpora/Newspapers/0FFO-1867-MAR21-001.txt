having the following objects, namely:—
Establishing a scheme for the administration and management of the

A scheme has been proposed, providing that the income of the said

blished in the same Hospital, known as the Samaritan Fund.

cation thereof, may be transmitted to the said Board, in writing, ad¬
dressed to their Secretary, No. 8, York-street, St. James's-square, Lon¬
don, within 21 days next after the first publication of this notice.—
Dated this 11th day of March, 1867.
HENRY M. VANE, Secretary.
PREMIUM of £100 is OFFERED by a member
of the Committee of the Ladies' Sanitary Association for the
best ESSAY ON VACCINATION.
The Essayist is to consider;—
1st. The actual value of vaccination as a preventive of smallpox;
embracing in this part the question whether vaccination as a preven¬
tive retains its power.
2d. The dangers of vaccination from the introduction of other
diseases into the organism, and the extent to which the value of vac¬
cination is reduced by such dangers.
Essayists are requested to write without any reserve, and to state
on the points named the whole truth as it is presented to their minds.
Every Essay must be legibly written, and in the English language. It
must be sent in with a motto, and no name. A sealed envelope, with
motto, name, and addrses of writer, to be sent at the same time as
the Essay, and within three months of the date of this advertisement,

Belgrave-square, London.
THE following PETITION will shortly be pre¬
sented to Parliament:—To the Hon. the Commons of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ircland in Parliament assembled.—
The humble petition of the undersigned, showeth,—
That the exclusion of freeholders, householders, and ratepayers,
legally qualified in every respect but that of sex, from the power of
voting in the election of Members of your Hon. House, by depriving a
considerable portion of the property, the industry, and the intelligence
of the country of all direct representation, is injurious both to the per¬
sons excluded and to the community at large.
That women are competent, both by law and in fact, to carry on a
business, to adminiater an estate, and to fill other positions, which, both
by investing them with interests requiring political representation, and
by affording tests of fitness, are usually considered to give a claim to
the suffrage.
That the admission of such persons to the privilege of the franchise
would be a measure in harmony with the principles of our representa¬
tive system, while its beneficial effects would not be attended by any
possibility of dangerous political consequences.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Hon. House
will take such measures as to your wisdom may seem fit for granting
tue suffrage to unmarried women and widows on the same conditions
on which it is, or may be, granted to men.
And your petitioners will ever pray.
Gentlemen or ladies desiring to attach their signatures are requested
to send for copies to the Hon. Sec., Mrs. Bodichon 5, Blandford¬
square, London, N.W.
A Second Petition from unmr ried women and widows possessed of
the property qualification will also be presented, and may be obtained
for signature by ladies possessing such qualification.
CAUTION.—PRINTED TICKETS having been
fraudulently used to obtain goods in the name of Messrs. BAR¬

move all misapprehension as to their HOUR of CLOSING on

the convenience of the public and to promote the interests both of em¬
ployers and amployed.—39 to 53, Regent-street, and 9 to 11, Piccadilly.

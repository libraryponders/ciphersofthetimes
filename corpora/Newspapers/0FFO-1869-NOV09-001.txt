DUC de MONTEBELLOS CHAMPAGNES.—
R. SYMONDS and SON direct especial attention to the pro¬
ceding CAUTION, as renewed attempts are being made to intro¬

CAUTION.—The Pall-mall Jewel Case.—Messrs.
HOWELL, JAMES, and Co. beg respectfufly to caution the
public that they are the sole patentees and manufacturers of the newly¬
invented PALL-MALL JEWEL CASE, the chief characteristics of
which will recommend themselves as a ready deposit and safeguard to
valuable property. In the construction of the case the greatest sim¬
plicity and portability have been observed, coupled with the utmost
secrecy and consequent security to the contents. It is fire-proof; and,
in discarding the hitherto shapened receptacles for the several articles,
the case is adapted to fit any jewel without the fear of the slightest
injury.—Howell, James, and Co., Regent-street, Pall-mall.
IMPORTANT CAUTION.—The unprecedented suc¬
cess of ROWLAND'S MACASSAR OIL for the hair has caused
counterfetters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy
the labels as frequently to deceive the unwary; some offer to dispose
of the recipe of a Mscassar oil, with other recipes of a similar cha¬
racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real () article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
only purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the toilet."

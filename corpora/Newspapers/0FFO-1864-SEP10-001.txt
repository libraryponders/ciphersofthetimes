CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—

ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to se¬
cure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, 1 have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number); and from

proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

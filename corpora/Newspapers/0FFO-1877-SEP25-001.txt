PERCY.—Come home at once, and relieve our
anxiety. Arrangements shall be made to meet your wishes as to
going to sea. Write or telegraph where a letter, with cash, will find
PARAGRAPH of August 27th and two similar ones
express an intrusion of authority which has not been claimed,
except in this column. Will they whose issue it is give their names
and a clearer statement, allow it be definitely grasped? Truly an excel¬
lenticomedy: a shadow throwing its form only on those who have
created it. "Other echoes may be simulated, but they are false, as
all untruth and evil is," &c. Forgive me. I have not been good, but
angryland impatient with others. I will try not to be so.

ALFRED STODARE begs to refer the public to
the following statement of facts with reference to the advertise¬
ment of his brother, Joseph ("Colonel"; Stodare. Alfred Stodare having
chosen to perform on his own account the feats, of some of which he is
the sole, and of others the joint inventor), instead of remaining with
his brother (a course he adopted for good and sufficient reasons), a
bill was filed against him in Chancery. The plaintiff, "Colonel" Stodare,
repeatedly postponed the trial, and, ultimately, his solicitors gave
notice that they withdrew the action, that they withdrew from the
cross-examination of Alfred Stodare's witnesses, and that they would
consent to an order to pay his costs; accordingly, on June 19, Vice¬
Chancellor Wood made an order condemning "Colonel' Stodare in costs.
Alfred Stodare having performed successfully at the Crystal Palace,
proceeded to Brussels, where he has been most favourably received, a
circumstance which has induced "Colonel" Stodare to issue advertise¬
ments calculated to injure Alfred Stodare and to mislead the public.

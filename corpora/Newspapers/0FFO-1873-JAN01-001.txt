go and see them on Friday and arrange everything. WRITE to me
to suburbe to say what you have done.—Yours ever.
DEAR MARY CHRISTINA.—Bad consequences
only must be the end if your concealment is persevered in.
Almost your last words promised to behave well to me; by doing so
my whole heart and endeavours would have been yours, and my re¬
spect assured to your mother. It can yet be so. Remember this
hereafter Do not forget I am trying to prevent sad termination, and
pray do likewse. You will not retuse my request, or to be a peace¬
maker, and while we have the opportunity. Blessings on us all would
be the result of peace; to me it would bring happiness. I ask you
at once WRITE. Address can be seen on reference. —WILLIAM

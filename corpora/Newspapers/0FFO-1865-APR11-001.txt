tombrails, headstones, memorial brasses, &c., designed by emi¬
nent architects, with prices, sent for six stamps. The modern progress of
ecclesiology has led to a general condemnation of the barbarous taste
which formerly prevailed in this respect, and to a desire for the adoption
of more correct forms. The present catalogue is a contribution to¬

cuted at Messrs. Cox and Son's own workshops, they can combine
economy of production with excellency of workmanship and materials.

HAMPSHIRE and SUSSEX AUDIT DISTRICT.
To the CHAIRMEN and VICE-CHAIRMEN of the BOARDS of
GUARDIANS of the above DISTRICT.
My Lord and Gentlemen,
Beg most respectfully to offer myself as a Candidate
for the office of Auditor of the Hampshire and Sussex Audit District.
My qualifications for the appointment I have the honour to seek at
your hands will, I think, be best gathered from the testimonials which
at the proper time I shall have the pleasure to lay before you.
I may however venture to call your attention to the fact, that a long
service in a Government Appointment, together with a legal education,
have rendered me familiar with the duties of the office to which
I aspire, as well as with the mode of keeping and auditing public
accounts.
Should you do me the favour to elect me to the office of Auditor of
your District, it will always be my study to deserve your confidence.
I have the honour to be, My Lord and Gentlemen,

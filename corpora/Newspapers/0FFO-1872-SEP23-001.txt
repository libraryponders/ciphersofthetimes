The Guardians of the Birmingham Proof-house hereby give notice as

1. The Gun Barrel Proof Act. 1868 (81 and 32 Victoria, chap. 113,
Local), constitutes the sale, exchange, or exportation, or the exposing
or keeping for sals, exchange, or exportation, of any small arm of
which the barrel or barrels have not been duly proved and marked as
proved, according to the said Act, an offense, and makes the offender
liable to a penalty of not exceeding £20 for every unproved barret,
half the penaity going tto the informer.
2. Pawning or pledging, or taking in pawn or pledge, small arms with
unproved barrels is made a similar offence, and is attended with a
similar penalty.
3. Any attempt to sell, exchange, or export, or to pawn or pledge
small arms with upproved barrels is also an offence, and is attended
with a similar penalty.
4The Government mark (commonly known as the Tower mark),
and which often remains upon barrels purchased from Government,
does not exempt them from lishibty to proof under the said Act,
untess the reaulations of section 119 are strictly complied with.
5. The Act extends to imported foreign arms. Notice in writing of
the importation usist be given and the barrels sent for proof, unless
the arms imported are intended only for conversion and export; fut
even then notice is requisite. Foreign arms, bearing a registered
foreign proof mark, are exempt. (Under this head, refer to sections
132 and 134, &c.)
 6. The Guardians have prosecuted many persons under the Act, and
are determined to uphold its provisions strictly. Under two very recent
prosecutions the penalties inflicted, were, in the one case £24, and in
the other £70, no-withstanding that in both cases the defendants
pleaded entire ignorance of the law.
7. And the said Guardians bereby further give notice that upon
trustworthy information of any onence or offences against the Act.
they will (at their discretion) prosecute, and upon conviction, liberally
reward their informant.

Gentlemen.—We have much pleasure in informing you that in the
great fire in Bunhill-row, on 14th inst., the whole of our books and
other valuable documents were saved in two large SAFES of your
make. One of the Safes especially had a most severe test, for it fell
a considerable depth into the minst of the hre, and while there the
brass handles were melted and the outer prates had evidently been red
hot. Notwitnstanding this, when the sare was got at, several days
later, the contents were round intact, although bearing traces of the
inteuse heat they had been subjected to. You are at perfect liberty to
use this letter in any way you please, for we think you can never have
had a more convincing proof of the excellent fire-resisting qualities of
Jyou safes. We remam, yours truly, ROBT. BANDS and SONS, late

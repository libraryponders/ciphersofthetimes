HAMPSTEAD-HEATH ENCLOSURE.—Some¬
n's up
DEAR, dear BOBIE, why have you left us in
anguish long? The promised letter has not followed your last
to William, dated Deal, June 3, 1860. Words cannot tell the desolation
of our hearts and Scottish home. Bereaved of my child, I am be¬
reaved, indeed. Have pity on your mother, Elizabeth T.
FIRST of the MONTH.—Dear FREDERICK,—
I am in great trouble, having had my money stopped without the
slightest intimation, and only knew it when I went to receive it on the
25th instant. I have been doing very well since your last kindness to
me, and, no doubt, shall continue to do so, but how to get over this
quarter I know not, having depended upon the money as usual. If
lyou can help me ever so little I shall be grateful.—R. M.
payp.—I cannot thank you enough for keeping your
promise. F. S. and leaving in C., return to B., completing their
service. There is no personal news, except that, through delay in receipt
 letter from consulate, I am unable to return and enter de T. How
dlittle you know of that morning's history—the intense effort required
not to involve some one very dear—it would have been ruinous, and
yet how much I would risk if necessary—I do not, shall not forget. Re¬
consider what are circumstances to a will like yours Pray WRITE,
only once more. January 15.—I have just seen an obituary notice—
how sad, sudden, unexpected. How much I wish I could be of some
ervice to you. Yours ever, T.

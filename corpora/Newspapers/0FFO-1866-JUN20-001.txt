To Colonel H. H. Greer, C.B., and Officers of the 68th Light Infantry.
Gentlemen,—On behalf of myself and the officers of the Ballarat, I
beg most heartily to thank you for the very handsome manner in which
you have referred to the treatment you received during your passage
from Auckland to England.
I am pleased to learn, from the very gratifying terms of your letter
accompanying the handsome present of a silver tankard, that my
efforts for the comfort and welfare of all on board have been appre¬
ciated and acknowledged in a manner so unexpected yet so pleasing to
myself.
Thoroughly reciprocating the good wishes entertained in your letter,
which, had circumstances permitted, I should have been glad to have
acknowledged before you left the ship, but which I now hasten to do
through the medium of The Times, and trusting that my future passen¬
gers will prove as agreeable as those from I have just parted,
I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,
(Signed) JOSEPH ALLAN, Master.
SATURDAY HALF-HOLYDAY.—The great
desire to lessen the hours of labour and to obtain a half-holyday
on Saturdays, has been so constantly brought before the public and the
emplovers, that the undersigned have determined to try the experi¬
ment by commencing to CLOSE their BUSINESS PREMISES at 2
o'clock on Saturdays, from the 14th of July next, and to continue the
same for three months. To carry this into effect, they ask the assist¬
ance of the public, and respectfully request that they will make their
purchases for that day prior to the hour of closing, and thus sanction
an arrangement, which it is felt will prove a great boon to a very nu¬
merous class. Signed by—

TABLE CROQUET.—Extract from the Field, Oct.
20, 1866 :—"One plan is to affix weights to the hoops (loaded

placed, and the weights interfere greatly with the course of the balls.
In Cavendish's improved patent table croquet, the legs are so contrived
as to hold the hoops firmly in place, and yet they do not interfere with
the running of the balls. We think we shall not be far wrong if we
is croquet will command a large sale."—Sole agents

ESCAPED from a MAISON de SANTE, in Pariss
a YOUNG GENTLEMAN, 26 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches in
height, stoutly built, has a mastive head, a peculiar drooping of the left
upper eyelid, and is clean shaved, except his moustache, which is waxed.

intellectually gifted, but in his paroxysms has no moral perception what¬

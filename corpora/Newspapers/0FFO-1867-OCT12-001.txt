THAMES CONSERVANCY.—It having come to

suance of the Merchant Shipping Amendment Act of 1862 being appli¬
cable to the river Thames;—The Conservators hereby give notice, that
the said REGULATIONS have applied, and continue to apply, to
vessels navigating the river. It has, therefore, been considered un¬
necessary to enact any bye-law with further requirements on the sub¬
ject; and it is the duty of all persons in charge of vessels navigating
the river to observe the said Regulations in all cases as far as prac¬
ticable.

TO LAND SURVEYORS and VALUERS.—
Farcham Union, Hants.—The FAREHAM UNION ASSESS¬
MENT COMMITTEE, with a view to insure a uniform and correct
valuation of all the rateable property in the several parishes forming
the Union, are desirous of receiving COMMUNICATIONS from
valuers who would be willing to make new VALUATIONS, and to
make valuation lists of the respective parishes, in conformity with the
recent Acts of Parliament.
The Union consists of the parishes of Boarhunt, Fareham, Portches¬
ter, Rowner, Southwick, Titchfield, Wickham, Widley, and Wymering,
containing about 43,000 acres, and about 3,000 houses.
The Committee believe that the valuations will be more likely to
secure general satisfaction if made by strangers to the neighbourhood;
they are therefore inclined to give a preference to valuers without local
interests.
The valuer will have to provide and correct for himself the necessar
tracings of the parish maps. He will also be required to furnish with
his valuations and valuation lists a copy of the tracings on tracing
cloth, and a correct terrier of each parish, for the use of the Com¬
mittee.
There are tithe maps for all the parishes, and in addition Fareham
and Wickham have maps of more recent date. There is also the Ord¬
nance Survey Map on the 25-inch scale, already published, for nearly
the whole of the Union, which it is thought may be of some service to
the valuer.
Mr. J. W. Blackman, a land surveyor, long established in Fareham,
is in possession of maps and documents relating to most of the
parishes, which he would be willing to place at the use of the valuer on
reasonable terms.
Valuers who may be willing to undertake the work are requested to
forward their terms to the Committee on or before the 1st November
next, by 11 o'clock in the forenoon, and state what time will be re¬
quired for the completion of the undertaking.
By order of the Commit

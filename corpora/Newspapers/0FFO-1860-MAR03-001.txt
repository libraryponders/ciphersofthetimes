Patent, dated the 13th day of August, 1859, were granted to Henry

stamped "Carleton's Self-acting Boat-lowering Hook," without which
none are genuine. And notice is hereby given, that legal proceedings
will be taken against all persons who shall manufacture, make use of
or sell any of such improved apparatus, which may be an infringement
of the said patentee's rights, and the patentee will feel much obliged

that he nas a PADDOCK of six acres, opening from the hall, for the
purpose of trying the dogs and giving them daily exercise. This is the

sideratum so important that the exhibition must command the appro¬
bation and support of all sportmen.

with falls of real water ; also will be added, for the comfort and health
of the dogs, a large paddock of six acres for their use, exercise, and
trial if required, the only building so near to the west end with a pad¬
dock. The Exhibition is held on the 23d of March, allowing two
months from this time for the preparation of the dogs, and also in
consequence of the Exhibition of Dogs at Paris (patronised by the Em¬
peror and Court) taking place in May, to which several noblemen and
gentlemen intend sending their dogs from here to compete for the
French prizes, which will deprive London of the best show of dogs in
May. In exhibitions that have taken place large prizes have been ad¬
vertised to be given, which have never been carried out by the pro¬
jectors. Mr. E.T. Smith guarantees the payment of the same, as ad¬

graph. Advertiser, &c.; and Messrs. Ransom, Bouverie, and Co., the
bankers, will pay the various sums awarded on presentation of the
award signed by the noblemen and gentlemen who have kindly con¬
sented to act as jurors at this national exhibition of animals, so use¬
ful to every gentleman. Mr. Puzey, of the King's-road, with a staff of
efficient assistants, will take the entire charge and care of feeding the
dogs; and as regards the ladies' pretty toy pets, H. Brown and Henry
Gilbert. Esqs., have kindly consented to attend to the warmth and com¬
forts of those little animals. The large and elegant hall, of patent
continuous rooffing sheets, erected by Messrs. Morewood and Co., of

ful stereorama. A pair of elegant iron gates, manufactured by Messrs.
Kennard and Co., will be erected for the visitors for a separate en¬
trance to the hall in the King's-road; indeed. Mr. E.T. Smith has de¬
termined to do everything in his power for the convenience and com¬
fort of the patrons and subscribers to the undertaking, and also to en¬
sure its repetition annually. Subscribers of one guinea will be entitled
to six tickets, of two guineas to 12 tickets, and the charge of 2s. 6d.

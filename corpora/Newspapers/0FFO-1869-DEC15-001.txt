IMPORTANT CAUTION.—The unprecedented suc¬
cess of ROWLAND'S MACASSAR OIL for the hair has caused

racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real  article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
only purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
"Lesion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pu
chasers as to where they make their selection of artieles for the tollet."

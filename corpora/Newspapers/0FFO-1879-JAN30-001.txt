ther Provision for the Final Settlement of Land Claims."
The attention of every person having any UNSETTLED CLAIM
to LAND in respect of the former purcuase thereof from the aborigi¬
nal natives of the colony, and which has not been disallowed, is
drawn to the provisions of the said ACT next following, that is to

Settlement Act, 1856," or "The Land Claims Settlement Extension
Act. 1858" (hereinatter called "the said Acts'" which shall not be
prosecuted before the 31st day of December, 1879, shall be deemed to
have lapsed.
Whenever any selection of land is required to be made under the
provisions of the said Acts, the Commissioners may prescribe a period
within which such selection shall be made, and if the selection be not
made within such period, such right or selection shall lapse and be
deemed abandoned, and the claimant or claimants shall have no fur¬
ther right, title, or interest in respect of such claim, or in respect of

possession of the land to which the claimant is entitied, and in which
the survey of the claim cannot be made in a reasonable time, to be
fixed by the Commissioners, the Commissioners shall determine the
claim by directing a grant of other land in exchange, or by the issue
of scrip of equivalent value, exercisable only within twelve months
after issue thereof.

sioners may anmit to hearing the claimants in claims 64 (Captain

FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 12 to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compuisory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political sconomy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned.

ANo. 3, Lothbury, E.C. June 4, 1862.
THE Court of Directors of the East India Company
do hereby give notice, that a GENERAL COURT of Proprietors
will be held as above, on Wednesday, 11th inst., at 12 o'clock.
A Proprietor (John Jones, Esq.) has given the following notices of

"That, in view of the refusal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
provide the necessary funds for the expenses of the East India Com¬
pany as by law required, it is expedient to consider how far the validity
of treaties made by the East India Company with European Powers
and with native Princes in the East, the advantages of which are now
enjoyed by the Crown, depends by the law of nations on the existence
of the East India Company, so far as those European Powers and
native Princes who are parties to the treaties are concerned."
"That the official announcement of 25,000 notices of eviction to
tenant farmers in one district, issued by European Zemindars under
the new Sovernment of the Crown in India, with the prospect of
80,000 more being about to follow, is an alarming feature in the prin¬
ciples of policy adopted by the new Administration."

THE COUNCIL of the ROYAL ASYLUM of ST.
ANN's SOCIETY have the gratification to announce that Mr.
S. C. HALL, F.S.A., has kindly consented to deliver a LECTURE in
aid of its funds at the Hanover-square Rooms, on Saturday, June 7th,
at 3 o'clock (exact time). Many distinguished patrons and patronesses
of the Society have promised to be present, and a number of the
children will attend the lecture.
The Lecture consists of a Series of Personal Memories of the most
illustrious Literary Men and Women of the age.
Tickets, 3s. reserved seats; 2s. unreserved seats; family tickets, 12s.
for six persons to reserved seats; 10s. to unreserved. Tickets may be

and Hall, Piccadilly; Messrs. Collard, Cheapside; Mr. Westerton, St.
George's-place, Hyde-park-corner; and at the Hanover-square Rooms.
The Council of the Society have much pleasure in directing the
attention of their subscribers, friends, and the general public to this
lecture. It has been the singular fortune of the lecturer to have had
personal acquaintance with nearly all the literary celebrities of the
epoch, and it cannot but interest all readers of the famous books of so
many great men and women of the age to hear them described by one
who has not yet far passed the prime of life, thus linking the present
with the past; for all of them are departed, and most of them had
put on immortality before many of those who will be his auditors were
born.
The principal persons of whom Mr. Hall presents written portraits
are the following:—Hannah Moore, Samuel Rogers, James Mont¬
gomery, Ebenczer Elliott, Thomas Moore, Letitia E. Landon (L.E.L.),

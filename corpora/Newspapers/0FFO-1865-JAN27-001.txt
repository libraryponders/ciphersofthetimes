FRANCISCO MENDES CARDOSO LEAL, of
Lisbon, seeing in Nos. 3,362 and 3,375 of the Jornal de Commercio
of that city, that a company is being formed under the style of "Lisbon
Repairing Docks and Engineering Company," in order to take charge
of the affairs of the Patent Slip Company of the Port of Brandac, in



following public NOTICE, in order that nobody may plead ignorance

1st. That the works of the Patent Slip belong to a company formed
on the 16th December, 1861, as per entry of the Notary Avelino da
Silva Mattos e Carvalho, book 319, page 35, viz, between Bessone (since
failed), for two-thirds of the capital, and White and Almada for one¬
sixth each; the first named being the treasurer and manager, and the
only one authorized to sign
2d. That between the advertiser and the above Company suits are
pending, one in the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, and the other in the
Supreme Court of Judicature of Lisbon (Clerk Varioncellas), the
advertiser having already a judgment in his favour, which condemns
the said Company to the payment of rs. 23,440 £000, besides the deposit
made for expropriation.
TO UMBRELLA and PARASOL DEALERS and
the PUBLIC.—The remarkable durability of the PARAGON
FRAMES for UMBRELLAS is exemplified by a fact which has re¬
cently come to the knowledge of SAMUEL FOX and Co., viz; that
these frames are frequently taken out of old umbrellas and put into
new ones, and the extent to which this is done by some manufac¬
turers compels the patentees, Samuel Fox and Co., to notice it, and
to invite particular attention to their label, having their trade mark as
well as their name, which they issue only with new frames, and which
should be placed inside each umbrella or parasol. Samuel Fox and
Co.'s frames, made of solid steel wire, are warranted in every way; they
are charged one penny per umbrella or parasel more than the frames
of other makers. Samuel Fox and Co.'s patent pebble tips are used
as an additional mark to denote their special manufacture, they are
charged without profit, and are of extreme strength and durability,
and will last as long as the frames; the various imitations of these
tips also necessitate reference to the label of S. Fox and Co.—Deepear,
near Sheffield, January, 1865.
IN consequence of the reduction of the 13th depot

CAUTION.—The METROPOLITAN STEAM
BLEACHING and DYEING COMPANY find it ndcessary to
caution the public that they have only two branches in addition to
their works at 17, Wharf-road, City-road, viz.:—472, Oxford-street,
W.C., and 7. Pavilion-buildings, Brighton.
HYDROPULT.—Caution. —Devices in imitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces.
and are calculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. Each
hydropult has a brass label attached to one cylinder, on which is
stamped the following, to wit, "The Hydropult, Vose's Patent,
manufactured only by Griffiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charle
Pomeroy Button, proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London."
In this connexion it may be well to state that the hydro¬
pult is the only force-pump in the market, weighing but Sib.,
that will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. The hydropult will
draw water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. The


are useless. The hydropult has been recommended as an efficient and
useful fire engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of
sessense-sremcnadansmngaugeesme
as fire engines. Robert Hogg, LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibbard,
Esq., F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other
well-known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable
garden implement. The hydropult has been recommended by the

trated News of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Maga¬

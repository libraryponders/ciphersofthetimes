animously carried:—
That, considering the serious injury that would accrue to the whole

to be successfully carried through Parliament, it is, in the opinion of
the Meeting here assembled, incumbent upon the inhabitants of the
square and its vicinity to unite in most strenuously opposing the said
Bills, and that this Meeting unanimously pledges itself to carry out this
resolution by every means in its power.
In furtherance of the object refersed to in the e eoe
oing resolution,
it is resolved that a subscription list be at once commenced, to obtain

ae ed at the Committee be empo e e

That this Meeting hereby authorize the Committee already ap¬

tion, and to collect subscriptions

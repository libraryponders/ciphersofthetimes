CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements have appeared, stating that the
advertisers could re-produce Cartes de Visite by photography at a low
price, now I. CAMILLE SILVY, caution all persons against such pro¬
ceedings, which infringe the acts for the protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great diffe¬
rence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to
secure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (above 15,000 in number), and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

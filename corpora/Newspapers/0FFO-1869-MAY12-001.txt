TEN POUNDS REWARD.—Infringement of
Griffiths Patent Mixing Machine, of which George Kent, of
No. 199, High Holborn, is the sole licensee and manufacturer. £1
will be paid to the first person who shall give me INFORMATION
and produce proof of the INFRINGEMENT of GRIFFITHS'
PATENT MIXING MACHINE in any manufactory, or that it is
otherwise infringed by illegal user or sale.
GEORGE KENT, 199, High Holborn, London.
Griffiths Patent introduces an entirely new principle in the construc¬
tion of mixing machinery, which by a single revolution of the handle
gives 288 strokes or divisions of the matter submitted to its operation,
and in fact so powerfull and effective is its action that it will even incor¬
porate water with oil or fatty matter. It is already extensively used by
manufacturers of liquid and semi-liquid compounds, as also by cooks,
confectioners, and others, who find it beat up their mixtures to a de¬
gree of excellence never before attained. The machines are made in
sizes adapted for any quantity, from one quart to thousands of gallons.
Prices from 21s.
INFRINGEMENT of GRIFFITHS' PATENT
MIXING MACHINE.—I, Thomas Wright, of Nos. 15 and 16, Here¬
ford-place, Commercial-road east, London, wholesale biscuit manufac¬
turer, having without sufficient inquiry and by inadvertence infringed
the patented rights in Grifliths Mixing Machie, of which Mr. George
Kent, of 199, High Holborn, is the sole licensee and manufacturer,
and Mr. Kent, with the consent of Mr. Griffiths, having agreed to sus¬
pend further legal proceedings against me, on my delivering up all
pirated machines to Mr. Kent, at his manufactory, 199, High Holborn,
and purchasing an equal number of genuine machines of Mr. Kent,
and paying an agreed sum for damages and costs, and also the cost of
advertising this ACKNOWLEDGMENT of my INFRINGEMENT.
hereby express my regret at having violated such patented rights, and
thank Mr. Kent and Mr. Griffiths for having so suspended legal
proceedings against me.

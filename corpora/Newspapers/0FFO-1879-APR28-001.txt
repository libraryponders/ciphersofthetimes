Service throughout the United Kingdom.
Applications from persons supposing themselves entitled as Next of
Kin should be addressed by letter to the Under Secretary of State,
War Office, London, S.W., and marked outside "Soldiers' Effects."
No application can be attended to which does not state the date
and place of the soldier's birth, enlistment, and eath, and the name
of his regiment; his regimental number should also be stated if
known.
Should these particulars furnished by the applicant not agree with
the facts recorded on the War Office cocuments relating to the de¬

agree therewith, then within three calendar months the Secretary of
State will furnish the applicant with the usual requirements needed
for the proof of the alleged relationship.
The application must be authenticated by the signature of the appli¬
cant, and his name should be affixed in the presence of the clergyman
or one of the churchwardens of the parish, or a Justice of the Peace.
The applicant's address, with the name of the post town, must also be
clearly stated. No personal application can receive attention.
Further lists will from time to time be published, and therefore it
will facilitate the applicant's inquiries to give the numbor and date of
the notice in which the deceased soldier's name appeared.—Effects,

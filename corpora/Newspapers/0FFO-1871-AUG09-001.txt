BLUE and WHITE FLOWERS.—I fear my present
(Monday, 17th ult.) arrived at a stupidly, if not reprehensibly in¬
opportune moment. I was not aware that dancing was about to begin.
I''shall ever feel deeply grateful for the honourable reception it met
with. As the supposed tampering with my correspondence, referred to
in previous advertisements, might, without further explanation, well
be imputed to some extraordinary misconduct on my part, it becomes
important to state (as I do most posttively) that there has been nothing
illegal or dishonourable in my conduct which would lend a shadow of
justification to so odious a proceeding. I did not make the statement
without good ground. The evidence of it is, I believe, such as w uld
satisfy any reasonable mind. At the same time, as this advertisement
might possibly give offence in quarters where the authorship will be re¬
cognised, it is only right that 1 should add that the latter portion of it
is "tentative," and that, in the absence of certain, positive, legal proof
of the supposed lacts, I throw no imputation upon any individuat,—

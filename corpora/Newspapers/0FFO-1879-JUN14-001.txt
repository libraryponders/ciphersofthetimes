MANAWATU LAND ORDERS.—Notice is hereby
given that on the 30th day November. 1877, an Act was passed
by the General Assembly of New Zealand, intituled an Act to provide
for the satisfaction of certain Land Orders issued by the NewZealand
Company, and theretofore exercised in the Manawatu or Horowhenua
districts, within the aforesaid Company's settlement at Wellington.
The attention of every person claiming under any such Land Orders
as aforesaid is drawn to the provisions of the said Act next follow¬
ing, that is to say:—
Every person claiming land within the Provincial District of Wel¬
lington under any Land Order oniginally issued by the New Zealand
Company, and which has been exercised in the Manawatu or Horow¬
henua Districts, must, within 12 months from the 30th November, 1877,
if he be a resident in the Colony, and within two years from such date
if he be a resident elsewhere, give notice in writing, by himself or his
agent, to the Commissioner appointed for the District of Wellington
under the Ordinance of the Legisiative Council of the Islands of New
Zoaland, Sessim 15, No. 11, for the hearing and decision of his claim
under the provisions of the said Act, and at the time of making his
application for the satisfaction of his claim must lodge with the Com¬
missioner the original land order under which he claims to be entitled
to select any section of land. Unless such land order shall previously
have been lodged with the Commissioner no claim can be haard and
determied until such original land order is lodged, or proof of the
loss given to the satistaction of the Commissioner.
The Commissioner will report to the Governor the name of the per¬
son found to be entitied to land under any particular land order, the
particular number thereof, the fact of such land order having been
lodged with him, or of his having received satisfactory proor of the
loss thereof, and the amount in value stated in such land order; such
report is to be considered and approved by the Governor in Council,
and forthwith published in the New Zealand Gazette, with the date
of the approval attached thereto.
Notification of the Governor's approval is a sufficient warrant to the
Commissioner to issue to the persons named in such approved report
as being entitled to land, scrip for the amount of money originaly
paid for the land order under which any such persons have been found
to be entitled, together with compensation to the amount of £1 for
every £1 sterling represented by such land order added thereto ; so
that every person found entitied shall receive £2 in value for every
20s, in value to which he shall have been found entitied, except in
caes of lost land orners, in which case proceedings must be taken
under the Lost Land Orders Act, 1861.
No scrip can be delivered by the Commissioner until the land order
in satisfaction of which such scrip is issued has been cancelled by
him.
Upon the receipt of scrip all the right, title, interest, claim, and de¬
mand of the person to wh
me is issted,
ae o d  all other per¬
sons whatsoever, to the land in respect of which scrip shall have been
issued is extinguished; and the issue of such scrip is, both at law and
in equity, a full and complete performance by the Crown, on behalt of
the New Zealand Company, of the contract or obligation of the Com¬
pany in respect of which such scrip shall have been issued.
All scrip to be issued under the autherity of the said Act is trans¬
ferable and is reciveable as cash by the Receiver of Land Revenue in
or towards the purchase of waste lands of the Crown in any part of
the provincial district of Wollington, but not elsewhere, and must be
exercised within five years from the date of its issue ; claims for the
exercise of scrip not made within such period of five years are barred.
The Commissioner cannot entertain or investigate any claims in
which the claimant shall not have notified his intention to have his
claim heard and decided under the provisions of the said Act within
the time limited for making such application. All claimants failing
to avail themseives of the provisions of the said Act are barred, and
their claim extinguishe by reason of such default.
Claimants not resident within the Colony of New Zealand should
forthwith appoint a duly authorized agent to do and perform whatever
may be requ site to obtain the benefit of the said Act. —Dated at Wel¬
lington this 4th day of January, 1878.

pleasure in recommending your Hydropult, for Ifully believe it was the
means of saving my house from being burnt down, during a private theat¬
rical entertainment given on the night of the 23 ult. The fire broke out
from some unexplained cause, and, from the height of the fiames, no
water could be thrown up to it with buckets. Your hydropult became
therefore invaluable, and was applied so effectually that in a quarter of
an hour the fire was extinguished. Yoursisigned), Thomas T. Clarke."

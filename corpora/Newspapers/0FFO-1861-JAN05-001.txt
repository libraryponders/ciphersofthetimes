DIZ. implores you to WRITE. Think of your
SHANGHAI.—If J. MeD., who wrote to the Private
Inquiry-office, in Devereux-court, on the 7th April, 1856, relative
to E. M. "Belgravia and Rugby," will ATTEND to the LETTER
forwarded in the same year, he will oblige.—C. F. FIELD, late Chief
Inspestor Detective Police.
E. V. to A. V.—I have consulted the same egai
authority employed by me in drawing the deed for No. 400, and
have received from him the following paper, addressed apparently to
you. "By the laws of M. you can convey all your share of the real and
personal estate of which your father died possessed, by a deed to be
executed by you and acknowledged before a U.S. Consul, Minister, or
Commissioner. This deed may contain either a special description of
each lot of land, or a general description, and will pass a good title, sub¬
ject, of course, to dower. It will also be sufficient authority to the exe¬
cutors to pay over your share of personal property. Our laws require
the use of wax or wafer in the seal affixed." To this I add, why not em¬
power the executers, immediately, to pay over past interest, and what
may yet accrue?

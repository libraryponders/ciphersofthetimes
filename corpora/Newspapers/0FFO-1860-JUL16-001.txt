MARIA.—Dearest Wife,—I hope you are well.
I am as well as the circumstances will permit. Dearest, you
must demand your liberty, and do so at once. Insist upon going where
and when you please. Do not allow them to take you away—they have
no right to keep you in a state of false imprisonment, nor to exercise
any power over you, now that you are of age. Write to me to the
same address, and take care to post it yourself—tell me how to write to
you, and where. I will make them set you at liberty by the strong arm
of the law. God bless you, dearest wife. Your ever true and affec¬
tionate Husband, EDWARD.

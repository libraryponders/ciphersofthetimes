counterfeiters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy

racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real t article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
only purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make theirselection of articles for the toilet."

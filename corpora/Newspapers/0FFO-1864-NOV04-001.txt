Menier, the purchasers should look for the trade marks, the real name
upon the back of each division of the cake, and the signature Menier

against imitations of their patent pebble tips. These imitations, which
are brittle and easily defaced, are being used by other persons to cause
inferior frames to resemble those manufactured by S. Fox and Co.,
by which a small extra profit may be made, at the expense of the
durability of the umbrella or parasol. S. Fox and Co.'s frames, made
of solid wire, are warranted not to lock together on opening the

steel, will not suap or become bent in the use. They are charged one
nenny per umbrella or parasol more than the frames of other makers.

A.M.—(Supplementary Description.)—In a German
capital has arrived a young English lady, apparently between 18
and 19 years of age, destitute and without friends. She is-tall, very
slight, and good looking, having short dark bair, and very dark eyes.
short teeth. The circumstance that her head has been recently shaved,
her great dread of being brought back to England, where she claims
relationship with noble famines, and her eccenuric conduct, lead to the
supposition that she has escaped the care of friends in this country,
hence this advertisement. INFORMATION as to her inentity will be
gratefully received by Mr. Pollaky, 13, Paddington-green.

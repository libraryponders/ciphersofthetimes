CRUEL and extensive DESTRUCTION of PRO¬
PERTY by ORGANISED RADICAL MOBS at BRISTOL.—
An Appeal to Conservative Ladies, Gentlemen, and Tradesmen.—A
large amount of personal hardship and suffering having been caused by
the unprovoked and ruthless excesses of the organised bodies of ruilians

minster, St. Panl's, St. James's, St. Michael's,
wells, and

cked so much property, an earnest APPEAL is mad¬
the Conserrative public on behalf of the sufferers. It will be very sad and
deplorable indeed if deserving individuals, who have been thus cruelly and
shamefully treated, and for no cause but that they were Conservative
voters, or had let their houses for the perfectly legitimate purpose of
committee rooms, should be allowed to endure losses that in many
cases must be attended with almost ruin to the sufferers. It is, there¬
fore, confidently hoped that all Conservative ladies, gentlemen, and
tradesmen who hold in detestation acts of persecution and outrage,
will kindly and liberally come forward and assist by their prompt con¬
tributions those heavy sufferers by mob violence, organised and set in
motion by unfeeling and unscrupulous partisans. Subscriptions

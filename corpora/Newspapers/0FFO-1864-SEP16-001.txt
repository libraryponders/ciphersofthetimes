CAUTION.—Fox's Frames for Umbrellas and
Parasols.—SAMUEL FOX and Co., patentees and sole
manufacturers of the Paragon Frame, and manufacturers of frames,
made of solid steel wire, for UMBRELLAS and PARASOLS, beg
to invite notice to their label, which should be placed inside
each umbrella and parasol, and to caution dealers and the public
against imitations of their patent pebble tips. These imitations, which
are brittle and easily defaced, are being used by other persons to cause
inferior frames to resemble those manufactured by S. Fox and Co.,
by which a small extra profit may be made, at the expense of the
durability of the umbrella or parasol. S. Fox and Co.'s frames, made
of solid wire, are warranted not to lock together on opening the
umbrella or parasol, and, from the superior quality and temper of the
steel, will not snap or become bent in the use. They are charged one
penny per umbrelia or parasol more than the frames of other makers.
S. Fox and Co.'s patent pebble tips, being used only as a trade mark to
denote their special manufacture, are charged without profit. They
are of extreme strength and durability, and will last as long as the
frames.—S. Fox and Co., Deepcar, near Sheffield, Sept., 1864.
PELLATT and Co. beg to CONTRADICT the
REPORT that they have REMOVED. They still carry on
business at their old-established premises, the Falcon Glass Works,

way Station. An illustrated catalogue post free.

PICTURES.—The New Discovery.—Mr. T. CLARK,
formerly of 62, Regent-street, now of the late Mr. Peel's Gallery,
(established in 1753), 18, Golden-square, W., begs respectfully to inform
the public, and particularly those interested in the fine arts, that he
still CONTINUES his highly successful and improved METHOD of
CLEANING and RESTORING OLD PAINTINGS. Most drawings
or paintings have suffered from the ravages of time, after the lapse of
a century or two, and by the application of Mr. Clark's useful inven¬
tion all their pristine vigour and freshness can be realiszed upon a
totally different plan from any other hitherto adopted. The striking
contrast each work presents before and after going through this pro¬
cess has been universally acknowledged, and it is effected without re¬
painting, except in cases in which there are holes, and then it is exe¬
cuted so as to defy the scrutiny of the most fastidious connoisseur.
Many a picture "full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains, with eye
offending marks," and comparatively useless, has been by this valuable
discovery so judiciously renovated, that when freed of its dirt and dis¬
colouration, the painting has turned out to be one of great merit and
value, and the work of some eminent master. Pictures trensferred
from panels and ceilings to canvass. Gentlemen can have their collec¬
tions cleaned under their own inspection, upon the most moderate

TO PUBLISHERS and ARTISTS.—Photography
on Woed.—Mr. THOMAS BOLTON, engraver on wood, having
succeeded in perfecting a process of PHOTOGRAPHING designs of
every kind on WOOD, begs to invite the attention of publishers and
artists to the great facilities and economy realized by this valuable
discovery, the artist's drawings may be at once imprinted on the wood
block on any scale, with all the faithfulness and microscopic accuracy
peculiar to photography, thus insuring all the vigour and fidelity of
touch possessed by the original. Every objlect of nature and art is
alike capable of being imprinted on the wood block by this process. To
publishers it secures great economy, as the most complex design ean
be transferred with the same case as the simplest. Mr. Bolton is pre¬
pared to execute engravings by this process to any extent, and begs to
refer to the illustrations which he photographed on wood and engraved,
from drawings by Mr. E. Armitage and the celebrated bas-reliefs by
Flaxman, recently published in the Lyra Germanica, by Messrs. Long¬
man and Co.—16, St. Angustine-road, Camden-town, N.W.

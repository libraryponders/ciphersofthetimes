Shrunk," on the back of the selvages. N.B.—W. B. and Son, having
engaged a thoroughly experienced man from London to damp and re¬
finish all their tweeds, they intend in future to send them all out pro¬
perly shrunk, and with an improved finish by steam pressing. The
above-mentioned goods supplied direct from W. B. and Son only to
wholesale London and country houses and shippers as heretofore.
Having started an additional new mill, full of the best machinery, they
can now supply any quantity of perfect tweeds, punctually delivered.

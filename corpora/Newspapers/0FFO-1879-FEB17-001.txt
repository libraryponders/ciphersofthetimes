GREE TRAD's in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to obe
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127g to 20 per cent, upon articles of daily use, and by the
stid more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that ne other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual dimination of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and 16) an insurmountable obstacle to tochnical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths worz. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the Unsted Kingdom. For
further particular, application should be made to the undersigned,

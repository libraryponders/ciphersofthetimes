even in thought of having offended you, and if such is unfortu¬

great trouble I was in. Pray let me see you. Most wretched under
your displeasure.

nachine is not the hydropult. Hydropults weigh but 81
and will throw seven or eight gallous of water
the innute a distance ofe
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. Hydropults will draw
water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. Hydro¬
pults can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or forcepump is
applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances are useless.
Hydropults have been recommended as an efficient and useful fire¬
engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of Great
Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department as
dire-engines. Robert Hogg. LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibberd, Esq.,
F.R.I1.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other well¬
known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable garden
implement. Hydropults have been recommended by the Gardeners'

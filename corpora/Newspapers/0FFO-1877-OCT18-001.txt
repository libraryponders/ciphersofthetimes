MR. GIBBS' latest IMPROVEMENTS in HAY
DRYERS may be seen, on and after the 12th inst., at Gillwell¬
park, near Chingford. These improvements were suggested by recent
trials at the Duke of Sutherland's farm, and will enable the machine
to deal with straw crops as well as coarse hay, flax, and other fibrous
products. Chingford is half an hour's rail from Liverpool-street; wag¬
tonettes meet the trains, and can be secured by a note to the Station
Master. Mr. Gibbs finds it impossible to answer the large number of
letters on this subject, but his Prize Essays and Statements of Results
can be had at the Auxiliary Offices, 36, New Broad-Street. The cost of
the machinery ranges from £60 to £500, according to the size of farm.

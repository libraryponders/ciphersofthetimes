think richly-deserved praise. The single figures, remarkably like draw¬
ings, are named the Mountain Nymph, Sweet Liberty, Adriana,
Sappho, Clio, Christabel, &c. No one free from professional photo¬
graphic prepudice can seo Mrs. Cameron's photographs without being
struck with the high degree of artistic merit which they possess; and
the contemplation of works so original and so beautiful leads to the
conviction that photography need not remain in the lower stage of a
mere imitative craft; and we are glad to notice that copies of her
works are offered for sale at very moderate prices."—Extract from the

insurmountable obstacle to the art-progress of the silver trade. Mem¬
bers of Parliament (especially) and others interested in the success of
technical education are earnestly requested to lend a helping hand, in
order that the TAX (at once unjust and impolitic) may be
ABOLISHED during next session, so that the silver trade may par¬
take of the advantages offered by the scheme about to be propounded
by the City Companies. For further particulars address Edward J.

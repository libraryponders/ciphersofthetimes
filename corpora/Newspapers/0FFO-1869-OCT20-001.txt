desion or Mesrs. D. NICOLL and Co.'s PATENTED GAR¬
MENTs, and particularly with regard to the dual garment called
the Rug ralctor. Laqrincipled persons, who have only suddenly
awakened to the advamage or this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to puss off clumsy
imitations for that which D. Nicoll and Co. have already proved
to be the cheapest article ever offered to the public. The safeguard
will be the right to demand to see tue trade mark, which may be thus
described; the Conts of Arms of London and Pans are printed or
woven on to a loop used for hanfing up the garment, and between
these emblems of the two caies, the words "Nicoll's Patent" appear.

IMPORTANT CAUTION.—The unprecedented suc¬
cess of ROWLAND's MACASSAR GIL for the bair has caused
counterfeiters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy
the labels as frequently to deceive the unwary; some offer to dispose
of the recipe of a Maeasear oil, with other recipes of a similar cha¬
racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real th article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
nly purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the tollet."

pending the progress of the cause, was refused, and also owig to the
peculiar circumstance that no report was given in the leading daily
paper, the defendant feels called on to publish the foilowing extracts
from the shorthand writers notes of the hearing before the Vice-Chan¬
cellor:—Plaintiff's Counsel.—"If your Honour had granted an in¬
junction we should have been obliged to comply with whatever terms
your Honour thought fit to impose. I am atraid that your Honour is
not in your present view going to grant an injunction." The Vice¬
Chancelior.—"I have not heard anything up to this time to lead me to
do so; you must take your own course. If you think you can make out
a case under the new practice that will justify me in granting an in¬
junction till the hearing of the cause of course you had better go on,
but I can only tell you frankly, that I see from the nature of the ques¬
tion and from reading the specification that you will find it very hard
work." Plaintiff's Counsel.—"I don't propose to struggle against the
impression which your Honour has thrown out. What I propose to do
is this—the ordinary order for an injunction not being granted, that
the defendant should undertake to keep an account." The Vice-Chan¬
cellor.—"Yes." Defendant's Counsel.—"We have no objection to
that." The Plaintiff's Counsel.—"Then the motion may stand to the
hearing. I am not in a position to state what particular time will be
required, because there may be an answer to be asked for.

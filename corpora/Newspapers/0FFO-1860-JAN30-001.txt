CAUTION to MEMBERS of RIFLE CORPS, and
other persous accustomed to use Firearins.—The Proof Master
and Wardens of the Birmingham Gun-barrel Proof-house, having rea¬
son to belleve that many rifles and other firearms have recently beon
sold the harrels of which have not been duly proved and marke as
proved, and for the safety of which therefore their possessors can have
no satisfactory guarantee, desire strongly to impress upon the attention
of the public in general, and particularly upon members of rifle corps
and their officers, the necessity of being personally satisfied, by careful
examination of each rifle or other firearm, that its harrel bears the
mark of due proof according to law. A special Act of Parliament, called
"The Gun-barrel Proof Act. 1855," provides that all gun harrels, ex spt
they are supplied direct from Government, must be proved at the Bir¬
mingham Proof-house, or at that of the Gunmakers' Company in London,
and, if they stand the test applied, duly marked as proved accordingly;
and the same Act imposes heavy penaities on persons selling or keeping
for sale firearms the barrels of which are not so proved and maried.
It is for the public safety, and with a view to prevent accidents, that
this intimation is given: and, as the public in general are not familiar
with the les al proof marks, the Proof Master and Wardens further give
notice that upon application of any person at the Proof-house in Ban¬
bury-street Birmingham, the officers of that establishment will examine
all firearms brought to them for that purpose gratis, and state whether
they bear the legal proof mark or not. No breach of the law by sending
out unproved arms can possibly occur except through direct criminality
of intention, or negligence so gross as to be scarcely less oulpable,
and the Proof Master and Wardens therefore earnestly request that
immediate information may be given to them of any rifles or other
arms known or found to be unproved, in order that legal pruceddings
may be instituted against the offenders accordingly. £5 reward will
be paid upon conviction of any offender to the person or persons
through whose information such conviction shall be obtained.—By
ordre of the Proof Master and Wardens of the Birmingham Proof¬
house.

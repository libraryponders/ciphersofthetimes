CHUBB v. GRIFFITHS.—CAUTION.—Notice, is
hereby given, that on the hearing, on the 16th of December, 1865,
of the above cause, His Honour the Ma
o f the Rolls granted a
decree making perpetual the injuuction which had on the 1st of June
last been granted against the defendant, restraining him from selling
under Messrs. Chubb and Son's name any iron safes not made by them,
and from affixing to any safes not of their manufacture plates bearing
their name. The decree also directed that the defendant should pay
the costs of the suit. All persons are cautioned against supposing that
such safes as may be found to be fitted with Chubb and Son's locks are
therefore necessarily safes of Messrs. Chubb and Son's manufacture,
as it is believed that large numbers of these safes are sold under false
representation, genuine name-plates being removed from Messrs.
Chubb and Son's locks and affixed on the escutcheon or on some con¬
spicuous part of the sate. Dealers in second-hand fireproof safes are
particmarly cautioned against selling, as Messrs. Chubb and Son's, safes
which are not of their manufacture, and against in any way affixing
their names on safes not of their manufacture, and against allowing any
safes professing to be of Messrs. Chubb and Son's manufacture to pass
through their hands without the strictest examination; and proceed¬
ings in Chancery will in all cases be instituted when offences of the
same or a like nature are brought to notice

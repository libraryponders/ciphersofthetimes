TO HACKNEY CARRIAGE PROPRIETORS.—
Messrs. WILLING and Co., 70, St. Martin's-lane W.C., having
been authorized by Sir Richard Mayne to furnish the CERTIFICATE
of APPROVAL and NEW TABLE of FARES on ENAMELLED
IRON to be affixed on the outside of hackney carriages, they beg to
inform hackney carriage proprietors that it is their intention to supply
the smaller size table of fares for the inside of hackney carriages also
on enamelled iron, to meet the wishes of those who prefer to adopt
them instead of Japan tin, hitherto used. The cost of enamelled iron
table of fares will be 1s. each, and when it is taken into consideration
that enamelled iron will remain good for any number of years if pro¬
perly fixed, and that Japan tin only remains legible for a few months,
it will be seen that enamelled iron is by far the cheapest and most
durable table of fares to adopt. The new table of fares will be ready on
and after Monday, the 2d day of December, and a man from Messrs.
Willing and Co.'s establishment will be in attendance outside the va¬
rious police stations, during the days on which the public inspectior
takes place to supply all that may be required either in enamelled
iron or Japan tin, as may be preferred.—70, St. Martin's-lane, W. C.,

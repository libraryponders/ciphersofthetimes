great taste, and at a heavy outlay, and is now OPEN on market days as
a corn exchange, where a very extensive business is carried on. The
scale of charges to merchants, dealers, farmers, and others, is so liberal
as to induce almost all persons frequenting the market to avail them¬
selves of the advantages thus offered them. It is also admitted by compe¬
tent judges that this beautiful room is well adapted for concerts and sing¬
ing, and is one of the best rooms in the county of Gloucester for such
purposes. Advertisements in neat frames may be hung on the walls
on moderate terms, by applying to Mr. R. K. Habgood, Hon. Sec.,
Cirencester.
IMPROVEMENT in the FLAYING of LONDON
MARKET HIDES and CALF SKINS.—At an ADJOURNED
GENERAL MEETING, held in the Reading Room, New Leather
Market, Bermondscy, on Thursday, the 30th ult.,
WALTER SMITH, Esq., in the chair,
It was moved by Mr. Powell, and seconded by Mr. Winser,
1. That in order to keep pace with the immense improvement in
other markets, it is incumbent on all parties connected with the trade
of the London market hides and calf skins to adopt some decisive
measures to improve the flaying of the same, and thereby benefit alike
the butcher, hide salesman, factor, and tanner. Carried unanimously.
Moved by Mr. Forbes, seconded by Mr. McRac, and carried unani¬
mously:
2. That it is the unanimous opinion of this Meeting that, as the hide
salesmen have expressed their readiness to aid in remedying the exist¬
ing evil, they should be requested, on and after Friday, 14th Novem¬
ber, carefully to select the ill-flayed from the well-flayed hides and calf
skins, selling each at their relative value, so that the serious damage
caused by want of care in taking them off may be made apparent; and
that for the future this system only will be acceptable to the buyers.

STRUVE and Co. request the public to observe carefully that
Struve's name is on the lable and red ink stamp affixed to each bottle
of their waters, without which, though contained in Struve's bottles, it
cannot be of their manufacture. The frequent application by other
parties of the terms "Brighton Seltzers," "Brighton Vichy," &c., to
waters with which Struve and Co. have no connexion, renders this
notice due alike to the public and to Struve and Co. Struve's Mineral

REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of their manufacture, bears their name
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felony.
This notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerous
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake ice Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬
sary complications, are unequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability,
and economy. Sole office, Wenham Lake Ice Company, 140, Strand.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE¬
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the
block ice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator alse effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any otherice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZING
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY. 3156, Oxford-street, Londen.

firds it necessary to make this announcement, as sets of ornaments,
stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their invoice.—

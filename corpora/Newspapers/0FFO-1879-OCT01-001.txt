HER
THE Rev. WILLIAM HETHERINGTON'
CHARITY to the BLIND. Established in 1774 at Christ,
Hospital, London.—Whoreas, the Rev. W. Hetherington, by gift i
his life time, enabled the Governors of the above named Hospital to
pay annuities of £10 each to 50 blind persons, in the hope that his
example would be follewed by other benevolent characters, the Go
vernors give notice that, from the very munificent additions made¬
from time to time, to such original benefaction, by deed of gift, be
will and otherwise, they are now enabled to pay annuities of £1
each to 700 aged blind persons; and that, during the month of Octo
her in every year, they are ready, on application, to issue from thi
counting-house of the Hospital forms of petition for any blind per

Note.—Petitions of unsuccessful candidates are to be renewed
annually, at the same period, on fresh forms to be procured as above
The leading qualifications are stated herounder, and, unless partie
can prove themselves strictly within them, their application will be

age 61 years or upwards.
Birth and Residence in England, to the exclusion of Wales and

Total Blindness for three whole years, and residence in the paris
or place where the blind person rosides at the time of petitioning fo
the three years immediately preceding the date of petitioning.
Any annuity, salary, pension, or income for life (if any) alread,
possessed by the blind persoh must be under £20 a year.
The intention of the founder (as oxpressed by himself) was to re¬
lieve such persons only as, having been in a better situation of life
are or may be disabled by blindness from maintaining themselves, and
on that account are become a burden on their children or relations
not in affluent circumstances; or, having but little of their own, wan¬
some addition to what they have to make life more comfortabl
under such an infirmity. The Governors, therefore, to prevent dis
appointment to many otherwise deserving applicants, give notice tha
persons of the following descriptions are deemed ineligible to th
Charity, viz:—
Day labourers, common soldiers and sailors, militia men, unles
principals serving for themselves; domestic and menial servants, joul
neymen in any handicraft trade, persons living by turning a mang
or polisher's wheel, or by other like employment; and also those wh
have ever begged, or have at any time during their lives received an
parochial allus or allowance as paupers.

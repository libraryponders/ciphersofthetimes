ve yet been manufactured."—Photographic Notes for March, 1860.
"This instrument has the following advantages over those in common
use:—It suits equally for examining opaques and transparencies, paper
and glass impressions; it can be used to cover plates bound in books;
it adapts itself to all angles of sight and focal lengths; it is easy to
hold in the hand, and admits the light with perfect freedom; it is
retty, compact, and can be put away out of sight."—Athenaeum.
"The whole apparatus fits into a neat and elegant case, and forms
altogether the completest
of this nature that we have seen."

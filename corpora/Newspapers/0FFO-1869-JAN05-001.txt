As the boundaries laid down on the Government maps were pointed
out to the Ordnance Surveyors by meresmen, or persons appointed by
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembled in quarter sessions, as
directed by the Acts of Parliament quoted above, the maps may
possibly become evidence respecting the boundaries, and thus affect
the right of rating lands. Therefore proprietors, agents, and other
persons to whom this notice is addressed, are particularly requested to
examine the sketch maps, to ascertain that the boundaries of those
lands in and for which they are interested have been correetly defined
and laid down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for com¬
parison with the boundary sketch maps, that, should any differences
be found, they may be inquired into, and corrected before the maps
are engraved and published.

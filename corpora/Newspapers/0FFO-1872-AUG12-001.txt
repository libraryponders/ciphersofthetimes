to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
Wetherspoon v. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indispitably esta¬
blished, would also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penalty of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
been induced to buy it, that to save them from total loss we will
allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entail a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to convintion will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

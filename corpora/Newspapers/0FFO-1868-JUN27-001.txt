decided
this C.

CAUTION.—ASH's FILTERING REFRIGE¬
RATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as fitted
with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the block
ice used for cooling, but allow it to rum to waste as heretofore, the
Piston Freering Maching and lco Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Asl's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alond
can the block ice be kept free from faint and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any other ice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction.
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent

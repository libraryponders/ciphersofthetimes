December 1869.
COMMUNICATED.—A Letter from the Rev. Frank
Burgess appeared in The Times, of London, of the 14th  t,
calling the attention of the public to the heavy testamentary expenss
of £8 10s. incurred by the widow of his late gardener before she could
obtain payment of £86 8s. 3d., the amount of his deposits in the Bristol
Savings Bank, and which Mr. Burgess thinks "is a great discourage¬
ment to those of the poor who prace their money in savings banks,"
Now, whether it be true or not that testamentary expenses do fall
heavily on small properties in general, it cermainly is not true that they
are specially burdensome to depositors in savings banks, but just the
reverse, for the following reasons:—
First. By the S.B. Acts no probate, or administration, or legacy
duty at all is payable by the representatives of a S.B. depositor unless
the deposits amount to £50, whereas such duties attach in all other
cases where the personals amount to £20.
Secondly. If a married man chooses to invest his money in the S.B.
in the joint names of humseir and his wife, whatever the amount may
be, it is payabie to the survivor without any testamentary or other ex¬
penes whatsover. It is desirabi, therefore, that depositors in savings
banks should know that in thss matter, at all events, they are better off
than their neigubours.

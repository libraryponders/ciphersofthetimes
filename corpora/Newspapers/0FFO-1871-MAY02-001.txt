INQUIRY as to WALTER MORRIN.—The said
Walter Morrin, a native of Rathangan, in the county of Kil¬
dare, left Ircland in 1856, being then aged about 23 years, for Mel¬
bourne, in Australia, where he arrived in the latter part of that year.
He was entitled to some property in Ireland when he so emigrated,
and was subsequently left a legacy of a considerable sum of money by
his mother's will, provided he returned to Ireland and claimed the
same within the time thereby limited, which time has not as yet elapsed.
He has nat been heard from since he so emlgrated in 1856, although
advertised for in the Australian papers. Under these circumstances
his relatives suppose he is dead, and, under such belief, his brother.
Michael Morrin, as one of his next of kin, apphed to the Court of Pro¬
bate, in Ireland for administration to said Walter Morrin, as of a
person supposed to be deceased, which Court made an order directing
the motion to stand over until after the insortion of further advertise¬
ments seeking information concerning the said Walter Morrin. This
present writing is, therefore, an advertisement hereby calling upon the
said WALTER MORRIN, if living to WRITE to his said brother
Michael Morrin, Esq., Rathangan, Ireland, and to the undersigned as
his solicitor, apprising them of the fact of his being alive and where
residing: and this is also to notify to all persons concerned that, unless
cause be shown within a reasonable time, administration will be granted
by said Court to the said Michatl Morrin. Any person knowing any¬
thing of the said Walter Morrin, or of his decease, if dead, is requested
to impart the same to the said Michael Morrin or the undersigned.—

CAUTION.—BETTS'S CAPSULE PATENTS are
being infringed by importation of capsules made in contravention
of his rights, which necessarily are numerous. Betts being the original
inventor and sole maker in the United Kingdom.—1, Wharf-road,
City-road, London; and Bordeaux, France.—April 8, 1868.
CAUTION.—The PATENT COMPOUND SET of
METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS, as suggested and ap¬
proved by Dr. Allnatt, vide The Times, Dec. 17 and 25, 1868, can only
be obtained of S. and B. SOLOMONS, 39, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly,

CAUTION.—JENNER and KNEWSTUB,
patentees of the ABC Despatch Box, beg respectfully to caution
the public against deceptive and useless imitations of their ELGIN
WRITING-CASE, which is to be had only of the inventors and manu¬
facturers. The trade are also cautioned against using the name "Elgin
Writing-Case," which is an infringement of the Trades Mark Act and
of the rights of Jenner and Knewstub, 33, St. James's-street, and 66,
Jermyn-street.
CAUTION.—Water Filtration.—The public are
cautioned, before purchasing nlters, to see that what they buy are
reany water puritiers, and not mere strainers, which latter, although
rendering water bright, do not remove the organic and mineral im¬
purities. Filters professing to remove lime effectually are a fallacy, as
no filter yet invented will do so permanently, and all filters in which
sponge is introduced are on the old system, for using which with the
idea of removing organic matter (that usually productive of disease),
the public were cautioned against as being of no avail in the instruc¬
tions to the Local Boards of Health, by order of the Privy Council,
and this caution is the more necessary as these filters are constantly
advertised as a "New Patent," whereas the only PATENTED FIL¬
TERS, containing nothing but the purest animal charc o ae¬
tao se

HONORABLE ARTILLERY COMPANY.—
Head-Quarters, Armoury-house, 1st January, 1863.—R. O. The
REGIMENT will MUSTER here on Saturday, the 10th instant,
at 12 o'clock at noon, and proceed, via railway, to Clapham, for a
march out.
Dress.—Review order, with knapsacks, great coats, leggings, and

MONORABLE ARTILLERY COMPANY.—
Head-Quarters, Armoury-house, 1st January, 1863.—R. O.—The¬
ANNUAL COURSE of SQUAD and COMPANY DRILL, under the
command of the Adjutant, will COMMENCE on Monday, the 12th
inst, and be continued on each successive Monday, at 6.30 p.m., until
the course has been gone through.
The course of musketry instruction, under Captain Field, will com¬
mence on Thursday, the 8th inst., and be continued every successive
Thursday until further orders. No. 1 Company will commence the
course, and the officer commanding that company will summon the
members of it to attend on the day named, at 6.30 p.m. Each com¬
pany will be summoned in turn to attend by its commanding officer,
and the officers of each company will attend the course with it.
The Commanding Officers Drill will be continued on Thursdays, at

The Commanding Officer cannot too strenuously urge upon the
members of the Regiment the necessity of attending these drills. In
the regular service every soldier is compelled to go through the com¬
plete course annually. How much more essential is it for Volunteers
to do the same; and the Commanding Officer feels satisfied that, if
members will but make the small sacrifice of time necessary for at¬
tending these drills, they will be amply repaid by the greater precision
—and consequent satisfaction to all ranks—with which the evotanons
in the field will be hereafter performed.
It is probable that during the ensuing year the Regiment may be
called upon for the performance of more public duty than hereto¬
fore. The presence of half-drilled men in the ranks on such occasions
produces confusion and unsteadiness; but such will no longer be the
case, if the exertions and good feeling of officers of companies and of
members of all ranks support the Commanding Officer in his en¬
deavour to maintain the discipline and efficiency of the Honorable
Artillery Company.
By order of Major Robins
G. BRINEWOOD POTTS, Captain and Adjutant.

of this Act, any person or persons who prior to the passage of this Act
shall have purported to purchase real estate in Vancouver Island, or its
dependencies, from the owner of the fee simple thereof, for a valuable
consideration, and shall have obtained a conveyance thereof defective
through want of proper words of limitation or of some informality,
and any person or persons who shall be entitled derivatively to an
interest so purported to have been purchased, and so originally con¬
veyed by an instrumens insufficient to pass the fee simple, may file a
Bill in the Supreme Court of Civil Justice against the original grantor,
his heirs or assigns; and, in the event of such bill being filed by any
person derivatively entitled as aforesaid against the original grantor,
his heirs or assigns, and the intermediate holders of the same real
estate, praying a decree that the said real estate may be vested in him
or them for an absolute estate in fee simple, the Chief Justice may,
if satisfied that the actual intention of the original grantor was to
convey the absolute legal fee simple, or the absolute equitable fee
simple, the real estate purported to be conveyed, order that the original
grantor, and all persons claiming as his heirs or assigns, shall show
cause, within 12 months from the date of such order, why a decree
that the legal fee simple, or the equitable fee simple, in the said
real estate should not be vested, by the order of the Court, in the
plaintiff or plaintiffs; and whereas a bill has been filed in the
Supreme Court of Civil Justice, wherein James Yates and John D—
Carroll are plaintiffs, and William Thompson and William Dixon are
defendants, praying a decree that LOT numbered 191 on the OF¬
FICIAL MAP of VICTORIA may be vested in the plaintiffs for an
absolute estate in fee simple; and whereas the said Chief Justice has
been satistied that the actual intention of the late George Dixon, the
original grantor of such lot, was to convey the absolute legal fee simple,
the said lot, numbered 191, and has, by a decree under his hand and
the seal of the said Court, dated the 29th day of August, A.D. 1861,
ordered that all persons claiming as the heirs or assigns of the said
George Dixon, deceased, should show cause, within a twelvemonth
from the 29th day of August, why a decree that the legal fee simple in
the said lot should not be vested, by the order of the Court, in the
plaintiffs in certain proportions in such decree mentioned; now this
is to notify all persons whom it may concern, that the Chief Justice
will, on or after the 29th day of November, A.D. 1862, proceed to
DECREE upon the said order, to show cause, and may, by virtue of
the said decree, order that the FEE SIMPLE of the said lot shall
be VESTED in the plaintiffs, or otherwise, either legally or equitably
according to the estate of the original grantor. The said George
Dixon was for sixteen (16) years a seafaring man, and subsequently,
thereto down to his death in the employment of the Hudson's Bay

March 23, 1861, on motion, Hon. T. BUTLER KING was called to the
chair, and Capt. James M. Turner appointed Secretary. On motion, a
Committee of three were appointed by the chair, to draft suitable reso¬
lutions, expressive of the sense of this Mesting The Chairman ap¬
pointed Messrs. William B. Richmond, Nathaniel H. Wolfe, and James
M. Turner. On motion, the Chairman was added to the Committee,
who reported the following preamble and resolutions:—
Preamble.—Whereas the cabin passengers believe it pre-eminently
due to the commander of this vessel that fit acknowledgment should
be expressed of their high appreciation of the distingnished ability
evinced by Capt. Manry on the recent voyage of the Adriatic from
New York to Southampton, we commend him as a navigator possessing
rare qualifications, happily blending the science of a Bowditch with the
skill, coolness, and judgment of a Maury. Socially, we found him a
true sailor, controlled by a genial heart, a manly frankness beyond
question, and an evident fixed purpose to discharge his arduous duties
faithfully, honestly, and fearlessly. As a gentleman, in his intercourse
with his passengers, we can without hesitation say that to us he has
been attentive, pelite, and obliging. He thus at once deserves our
praise, secures our friendship, and commands respect. In view of these
facts be it
Resolved, That we tender our sincere and heartfelt thanks to Capt.
Maury; and that to the Committee named above be delegated the
pleasing duty of communicating to that gentleman this preamble and
resolutions, duly engrossed.
On motion, the preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted,
and the officers of the Meeting directed to have the same published in
The London Times and New York Herald.
On motion, the Meeting adjourned.

their whole attention to it, and after the experience and extensive prac¬
tice of 40 years, have succeeded in inventing TINTED SPECTACLE
LENSES of the greatest transparent power and brillancy. The valu¬
able advantages derived from this invention are that vision impaired
is preserved and strengthened, very aged persons are enabled to em¬
ploy their sight at the most minute occupation, can see with these
lenses of a much less magnifying power, and they do not require the
frequent changes to the dangerous effects of further powerful assistance.

Defendants.—Upon motion this day made unto this Court by counsel

fendant James Coleman has been within the jurisdiction of this
Court within two years next before the filing of the said bill, and
that all due diligence has been used to serve the said defendant with
a copy of the said bill, but without effect, and that upon inquiry at the
last-known place of abode of the said derendant, and at other places
where at the time when the said bill was file  he might probably have
been met with he could not be found, so as to be served with a cony of
the said bill, and that there is just ground to believe that the said
defendant has absconded to avoid being served with such copy, and
upon reading the said affidavit, this Court doth order that the defen¬
dant JAMES COLEMAN do APPEAR to the paintiffs' bill on or
before the 27th day of June next, and the plaintiffs are to cause a copy

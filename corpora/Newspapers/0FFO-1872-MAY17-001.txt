M. M.—In a German capital has arrived a young
English lady, apparently between 18 and 19 years of age, desti¬
tute and without friends. She is tall, very slight, and good-looking,
having short, dark hair and Spanish eyes, small face, bad teeth. Her
linen is very fine and marked E. M. According to her statement, she
was secretly married in April, 1870, at an hotel in Battersea. The
circumstanse that her head has been recently shaved, and her in¬
coherent expressions, lead to the supposition that she has escaped the
care of friends in this country, for which reason this advertisement.

DISEASED CATTLE REGULATIONS.—Proclamation, by His
Honour ISAAC EARL FEATHERSTON, Esq., Superintendent of
the Province of Wellington, in the Islands of New Zealand.—Whereas,
by Section No. 9 of the "Diseased Cattle Act, 1861," it is enacted,
that "If at any time it shall be made to appear to the Governor that
any infectious or contagious disease has broken out in any district out
of the colony it shall be lawful for the Governor by order in Council, to
declare that such district is infected within the meaning of this Act,
and from time to time to make such regulations as to him shall seem
fit, for prohibiting the importation of cattle into the colony from such
district and the landing or driving of such cattle, and for destroying
cattle imported, landed, or driven contrary to such regulations;" and by
Section 10 of the same Act it is also enacted, that, "If at any time it
shall be made to appear to the Governor that any infectious or con¬
tagious disease has broken out among cattle in any district of the
colony, it shall be lawful for the Governor, by order in Council, to
declare that such district is infected within the meaning of this Act.
and from time to time to make such regulations for destroying diseased
cattle therein, and for prohibiting the removal or transportation of
cattle from one part of the colony to another, and for prevent¬
ing the further spread of such disease as to him shall seem fit;" and it
is by the same Act also enacted that the Governor in Council may by
warrant under his hand, from time to time, delegate to the Superin¬
tendent of any province within the colony, all or any of the powers
vested in the Governor, or Governor in Council, by the said Act, sub¬
ject to such regulations as he may think fit, and may from time rescind
such delegation:—And, whereas the Governor hath, with the advice
and consent of the Executive Council of New Zealand, delegated to
Isaac Earl Featherston, Esq., so long as he shall hold the office of Super¬
intendent of the province of Wellington, the several powers vested in
the Governor by the second, fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth, and tenth
Sections of the said Act, subject to being rescinded as in the said Act
is provided, and subject to the regulations issued by the Governor in
Council on the ist day of October, 1861, and to any other regulations to
be, from time to time, duly made.
Now therefore, I, the said Isaac Earl Featherston, by virtue of the
powers vested in me in this behalf, do hereby proclaim and declare—
first, that after the date hereof the several colonies of Australia, that
is to say, the colony of Victoria, the colony of New South Wales, the
colony of Queensland, the colony of South Australia, and the colony of
Western Australia, as well as the colony of Tasmania, and the colony
of Cape of Good Hope, and the islands of Great Britain and Ireland
shall be deemed to be infected districts within the meaning and for the
purposes of the above mentioned Act, and that no cattle after the date
hereof until further notice shall be imported into the province of
Wellington from such districts; provided, however, that the Super¬
intendent of the province may allow any cattle to be landed from
vessels from the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, subject to such
conditions and restrictions as he may deem expedient and the circum¬
stances of any case may require; and I do also proclaim and declare,
that after the date hereof, the province of Otago and the province of
Southland, in the colony of New Zealand, shall be deemed to be in¬
fected districts within the meaning of the said Act, and that no cattle
shall be imported into the province of Wellington from either of the
said provinces.
Given under my hand, and issued under the Public Seal of the Pro¬
vince of Wellington, at Wellington, this 19th day of November, 1862.

GENERAL NURSING INSTITUTE, 5, Hen¬
rietta-street, Covent-garden, W.C. Under medical direction.
Lady Superintendent—Mrs. NIKEL.
Secretary—T. Hamilton, Esq.
The object of this Institute is to present to the public, under medical
supervision, a class of nurse fit for every emergency connected with the
sick room, both medically and surgically.
To bring together highly respectable nurses for the lying-in chamber
to facilitate the acquisition of wet nurses of good constitution, and
those who are adapted for the bringing up of infants who may be de¬
prived of maternal care.
The next department will consist of fever nurses (separated from
others), who will undertake the management of all contagious diseases,
and further to provide respectable persons to wait upon chronic in¬
valids, those addicted to habits of intemperance, or suffering from any
temporary or sudden aberration of intellect; and lastly, it is intended
to carry out a communication between nurses arriving from India and
the Colonies (natives and others), and thus to provide familics with
proper attendants for distant voyages.
Skilled nurses will be forwarded to all parts of England upon the par¬
ticulars of the case being supplied to the Secretary or the Superin¬
tendent.

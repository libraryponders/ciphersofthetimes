POLOGY.—We very much regret that we should
 been the means of printing statements in a pamphlet
wratten and circulated by Mr. Henry Taylor, "Honorary Conductor of
the Marylebone Penny Readings," from the Harrow-road-hall, Pad¬
dington, dated July, 1869, concerning alleged misconduct of Mr. M. S.
Myers, the Editor of the Bayswater Chronicle, which he complains of
as defamatory. We did so merely in our capacity of printers, and
without any knowledge as to the truth or falsehood of the statements;
and if we have been the means of injuring him we much regret it, and
we have already supplied him with the name and address of the author
of what he deems a calumnious statement.—Dated this 6th day of
August, 1869.

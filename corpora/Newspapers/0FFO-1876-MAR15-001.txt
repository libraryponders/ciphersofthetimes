MESSRS. S. ALLSOPP, and SONS feel it incum¬
bent on them to publish for the satisfaction of thekr customers,
the following letter, which they have received from Dr. Hassall, in cor¬
rection of an error in his recent book on Food:—12, Pall-mall, S.W.,
London, 9th March, 1876.—Gentlemen, I am very much annoyed in¬
deed to find, that, through some madvertence on my part, a most un¬
fortanate errer has been made in my book, which has just been pub¬
listed, entitied "Food: its Adulterations, and the Methods for their
Detection, relative to the water used by you in the brewing of your
justly celebrated ales. It appears, that in quoting at page 681, the
analysis malle by Dr. Henry Bottinger, of the water used in your
brewery, it is stated that it contams 7.65 grains of sulphate of zinc, iny
stead, as it should be, 7'65 grains of sulphate of potash, and that this
has led th some very unfortunate comments on the purity of your ales,
in "Nature" of last week. It is. of course, hardly necessary for me to
state that there is ne trace of any such defetéricus ingredient as sul¬



potash, which is one of its natusa l in e e i n
is eierie t ly harmless in
every way. No one can regret this mistake more than 1 do; but, ar
some mitigation of it, and to show that it was not an intent
a o nn,

to refer you to page 692 of the same book, in whick
state dis¬
tinctly, that having subjested to a most care e,
to o lees than
40 samples of your bitter beer I found them "to consist o

dnd
of malt and hops, and the constituents of pure spring water, no
tohe e redient of any kind being discovered, etther
or e ie o in¬


at the above 40 samples " were procure d uaeiter eire,
m¬
teances wehich precluded the possibilt
o error, fallacy, o on

tion for the sefection." 1 will-st once write to the E.
ort"

and ask him to be good enough to insert a copy of this letter, which

astory to you, in his next unmber, and you are of


to u rther use of it that you may think

ttemen, Yeurs truly, Arthur H. Hassall.—Messrs.

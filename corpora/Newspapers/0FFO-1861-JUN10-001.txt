their 3½ and 6 guinea Malvern landscape glasses. "Alp-climbers,
yachters, naturalists, riflemen, pedestrians, summer tourists of all
kinds have an interest in the art of making field-glasses. We have
recently tried, on the hill side and at the butts, a landscape-glass made
by Messrs. Burrow, of Great Malvern, and, though the price is mode¬
rate, we can speak well of its powers. It is small in the pocket, light in
the hand, easily adjusted, and renders the form and colour of the object
more than a mile off with distinetness. At the sea-side, at a review, or
among the moors, such a companion as the Malvern landscape glass
must be valuable to many men. It is also available at the Opera."

monial:—"Admiralty, Somerset-house, 3d Nov., 1863.—Gentlemen,—

scope I bought of you in June, I can say that it is far superior to any
glass of the same price which I have yet met with. I used it for a
fortnight while practising at a rifle range on the sea-beach, and found
that if I had chosen to do so I could have dispensed with the services
of a marker. Nothing is more disturbing than the mirage arising from
the action of a midsummer sun on wet sands; still I found that I

scope, I went on one occasion at the end of my moming's practice to
the head of the pier, 2; miles distant as the crow fies, and counted the

was so much mist that a well known seamark at a distance of seven
miles was invisible. At other times the glass afforded me much amuse¬
ment; looking from my window. I could recognize those who were far
off in rowing or sailing boats, and my scan of the horizon would often
reveal a sail totally invisible to the naked eye. In conclusion, I have
only to observe that, in my opinion, of all the telescopes exhibited this
year at the Wimbledon meeting of the National Rifle Association, there
was not one to be compared to yours for great power with great cheap¬
ness.—Your obedient servant, SAML. S. LEWES,

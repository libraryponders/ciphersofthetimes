RETTS v. MENZIES.—Notice to Capsule Con¬
sumers.—Opinions of Counsel.—"Considering that the Court of
Exchequer Chamber was divided on the question of the validity of
Mr. Betts' Patent, and that the Vice-Chancellor Sir Wm. Page Wood
has on more than one occasion expressed opinions on the validity of
the patent in conformity with the views of the minority of the Judges
in the Court of Exchequer Chamber, we think Mr. Betts should not
rest satisfied with the judgment of the Court of Exchequer Chamber,
but should appeal to the House of Lords. If Mr. Betts should suc¬
ceed in his appeal to the House of Lords, all persons who may in the
mean time, and pending his appeal, have infringed his patent, by
making, using, or selling articles, made according to the specification
of his patent, will be liable to a suit in Chancery for an account of the
profits he may have made, and for an injunction to restrain any fur¬
ther infringement of the patent.

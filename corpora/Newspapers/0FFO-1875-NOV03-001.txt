For the better protection of our well-known Trade Tities

fraudulent imitations, we hereby give notice, that it is our intention
to register such titles under the superintendence of the Commissioners
of Patents, with such alterations and auditions as may be deemed
necessary. Full particulars of sucu registration will be duly an¬
nounced. In the meantime the public are requested to see that our
name is upon the label of every cask and bottle. This CAUTION is
the more necessary as many firms are adopting the word "Nourishing"
upon labels similar in form and colour to our own, calculated to de¬
ceive. Furthermore, every label of the genuine Nourishing Stout
has the words "Analysed and reported on by Dr. Hassall."—

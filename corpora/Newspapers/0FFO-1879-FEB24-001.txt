FREE TRAD's in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tain perfeet FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (lj un¬
just, secing that no other sumlar trane is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual dimnution of the trade; (3) subveraive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy, (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of cpinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east. London.

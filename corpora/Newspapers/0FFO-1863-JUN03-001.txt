Rhenish wine, imported from Rotterdam, containing bottles bearing

in the Tribunal Correctionel of Havre, a parcel of 250 cases, containing
3,000 bottles of wine bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels and
corks, seized by the French Customs authorities (the said spurious wines
having been sent from Germany to Havre to be thence shipped to Eng¬
land, and thus, through the colourable importation from a French
port, to avoid detaction on arrival here), were adjudged to be confis¬
cated: All persons are hereby cautioned against dealing with spurious
Champagnes bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels and corks.

Dear Sir.—We, the third class passengers, on board the ship Agin¬
court, feel it our duty on approaching the termination of our voyage
to tender our grateful ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS for the many kind¬

Your gentlemanly conduct and strict attention to our slightest wants,
calls forth praise that words are inadequate to express; and, although
the voyage has been long and tedious (occasioned by events over which
you had no control), yet the kindness which we experienced from you
and all your officers, has been so bountifully diffused and warmly
appreciated, that it has been more like a pleasure trip than a length¬
ened voyage at sea, and, in parting with you, we leave behind those

Your abilities as a commander we cannot doubt; a thorough know¬
ledge of the duties, imposed with a proper amount of discretion, for
the safety of all those under your care, when any difficulty presents
itself, seem to be pecullarly your own: and we fondly hope that, by
the blessing of Providence, you may be long spared to receive that
approbation which your valuable services justly merit.
Wishing you every happiness and prosperity,
We remain yours most respectfully
(Signed by all the Third-class Passengers).

CHAPTER I.
THE HOME OF LEONORA. ALDI.
READER, were you ever at Tenby ? I dare say
not. It is more probable that you have visited
Brighton, Weymouth, Eastbourne, Hastings, Tor-
quay, Boulogne, Dieppe, Havre, Ostend, Hon-
fleur, or any other bathing-place, than that you
have been at Tenby! And yet that lovely town
lies barely two hundred and fifty miles from
London, and offers all that would seem to be
irresistible attractions, both to sick and hale, in
the multitude of its pleasant excursions, the long
stretch of its level sands, and the magnificent
views which surround it. Pembroke Castle, famous
in history, is in the immediate neighbourhood;

and a letter to Oliver Cromwell from one of his
generals, in June 1648, is said to be extant,
which thus records the valour of the Tenbyites:
“We have more trouble,” says the irate soldier,
“with these Welshmen than we looked to have ;
and the seaport town of Tenby holdeth out, as
though she thought herself to be Pembroke
Castle.” Before a month was out, both Castle
and town were taken.
A still quainter memory of Tenby is preserved
in the history of two bishops, whose residences
were in sight of each other, and who, being both
celebrated gourmands, employed the ingenuity
of their leisure—at a time when “telegrams”
were unknown—in contriving a set of signals
stating what each had planned in the way of a
good dinner for that day. Both bishops continued
telegraphing, à qui mieuw miewa!, until one be-
came so thoroughly convinced of the superior
Ude and Soyer inspirations of the other, that
the flag of his episcopal castle was hauled down
in token of cheerful surrender, and of the inten-
tion of the vanquished to dine with his right
reverend brother. The record, however, closes
somewhat gloomily; for this diverting rivalry of

culinary enjoyment was suddenly interrupted by
one of the bishops, Bishop Barlow, coming
“under the law” for disposing of the leaden
gutter pipes and ornaments of his residence;
whether to defray the excess of expenditure in
copper stewpans, or, as history apologetically as-
sures us, to provide portions for his five daughters,
cannot now be known. But we have every reason
to believe that good Bishop Barlow's stripping
the palace of St. David's and Castle Llewhaden
of their leaden roofs did not appear a heinous
sin in the eyes of his clerical contemporaries, for
we read that the five daughters were comfortably
married to five other bishops, namely, the Bishops
of Hereford, Lichfield, Coventry, and York; and
Day and Wickham, successively Bishops of Win-
chester. “Autre temps, autre maurs.”
These, however, are anecdotes belonging to
bygone days; and Tenby lies now among the
scattered ruins that speak of quaint histories and
warlike times, clad in a cheerful smile. The sun-
shine gleaming on her slate-roofed houses lights
up a hundred lovely nooks in Caermarthen Bay;
in every nook a home, where, if the luxury of
the gastronomic bishops be not attainable, there

is content, and elegance, and much merriment.
Laughter sounds through the honeysuckle hedges
that trail down the high banks to the very sands
of the sea; and peeps of pretty gardens, with
more variety of flowers than it would seem pos-
sible could be crammed into the small space,
delight the passer-by with bursts of bloom and
fragrance, as he roams along his shoreward path.
In one of these homes—the most hidden of
all in its surrounding hedges of honeysuckle,
sweetbriar, and travellers' joy; the most wonder-
ful of all for the proportion of flowers to the size
of its garden (which even boasted a succession of
green terraces sloping to the sea, and some grace-
ful copies of antique statues)—lived, at the time
of which I am writing, a retired army captain, a
widower, with his two daughters.
All the population of Tenby knew and respected
Captain Brooke; and all knew his history, which,
though simple, was, in the opinion of the female
portion of that little society, “extremely ro-
mantic.” For when Captain Brooke was a smart
young officer, serving with the allied armies, his
comrade and bosom friend was killed by his side;
and, while he lay bleeding to death, he confided


## p. 5 (#21) ###############################################

LOST AND SAVED. 5
to Captain Brooke that he was married to a Pied-
montese of noble birth, against the will of her
family, and that she and her little girl would be
left friendless and forlorn in this world of trouble.
“The bitterness of death to me,” he said, “is
leaving my Leonora without a home !”
Those were the last words of the slain; and
Captain Brooke could only hope that his expiring
comrade heard his attempt at consolation, by
the sweet sad smile which rose amid the shadows
of death already darkening over his handsome
face, and sealed his brow with that unutterable
expression of calm which death alone can show.
“While I have a home, Leonora Aldi shall
never want one.” That was Captain Brooke's
anSWGr.
He kept his promise. Though it really seemed
in after days a perplexing one. When the horror
and grief of war-time passed away; when the
beautiful young widow and her child were quietly,
and even cheerfully, dwelling in England; when
Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena, and Captain
Brooke himself had to return home; when, in
short, circumstances so altered round them that a
certain awkwardness sprung up, —Captain Brooke

had to consider how he could best fulfill his pledge;
and being a man without female relatives or
family ties, the bright idea occurred to him to
make one vow more, to rivet the exact and per-
manent performance of the first. He proposed
for the pretty widow, and was accepted; and he
took the little villa near Tenby, and called it
“The Home of Leonora Aldi.” But the simple
inhabitants of that Welsh seaport, being as much
puzzled as the inhabitants of some Irish village,
who, when a gentleman called his house “Il bel
Retiro,” transformed the name to “Balrattery,”
were completely posed by the title given to the
Tenby cottage; and, after struggling with various
misnomers, the place grew to be called simply
“The HOME :” and as such was known to all the
little world of Tenby. And a Home it was, to
all intents and purposes. Whatever of sacred
and tender may lie in the spell of that dear word
which foreign languages cannot translate, was to
be found there, in tranquil perfection.
The Italian widow had not long survived her
second marriage; but she died thanking Captain
Brooke for all his kindness, and she lived long
enough to leave him two children, in addition to

the little orphan he had gathered to his bosom
with that friendless wife. He loved that pale
gentle girl for her mother's sake and her own:
loved her as well as his own Beatrice, the merry
maid of sixteen, wild as a fawn and beautiful as a
picture: loved her as well as his dark-eyed and
daring Owen, who, cradled within sound of the
dashing waves, was already a midshipman in the
royal navy. They were a very happy family;
sought and respected by their equals, sought and
beloved by the poor. Familiar to the toiling fisher-
man, the distressed sailor, the wayworn woman
and her babe,—was the steep path that led to The
Home. Charity and tenderness dwelt there; hope
and help. As to more ambitious hospitalities,
they were rare and unfrequent. Captain Brooke
never gave “a dinner party” in his life; but
now and then one friend, or even two friends,
dined at The Home. Some stray geologist, or
some remarkable and pleasant tourist, was invited
to partake their meal; and on these occasions
Mariana, the elder sister, and Beatrice, the
younger, set out their table with flowers, and the
captain himself decanted his best wine, and in
the evening the girls sang to the guitar or

listened to grave conversation, and they all went
smiling to bed, with a gay “good night,” and a
tender “God bless you,” to meet in the morning
with the same joy and in the same peace. So
happy, in their obscure corner at Tenby, were all
the inmates of that lovely cottage, pointed out to
strangers as “The Home.”
So happy! up to a certain time, at which our
story commences, when the cloud and the breeze,
which were to grow into murky tempest, came
on, one fresh summer's day, and brought change,
and darkness, and shipwreck, tears and sorrow,
into the pleasant garden and the sunny chambers,
and the hearts of the dwellers by the lone sea-
shore.

CHAPTER II.
A BIRTHDAY FíTE.
WELL, there was no sorrow yet. On the contrary,
the party from The Home were out on the shore
celebrating, by a simple festival of their own,
the birthday of the handsome sailor-boy Owen.
They were to drink tea on the sands. Why they
should drink tea on the sands, instead of in the
comfortable sunny drawing-room of the cottage, let
the lovers of picnic meals determine; it must have
been pleasanter, or they would not have done it.
Captain Brooke was there, smiling and ani-
mated, chatting gaily with his midshipman son.
Mariana, the elder of the girls, sat in the deep
recess of the little sandy cove, making a parade of
her tea and cake, unpacking them out of a rustic
basket, and setting in the midst of all a glass vase
full of the beautiful white moss roses, for which

Captain Brooke's garden was so celebrated. Bea-
trice, the younger girl, scarcely yet weaned from
childish play, had hung her beautiful brown hair
with seaweed, whose delicate strips of various
colours drooped over her cheeks and neck. Á
“mermaid toilette ” she called it, “in honour of
the birthday of a sailor brother;” and surely no
ornament that ever was worn could be more beau-
tiful than those fairy wreaths of crimson and green,
and tawny yellow—damp, pliant, and pendent–
mixing with the brown curls that floated in rich
profusion on her shoulders. A large Newfound-
land dog barked and scratched among the lazy star-
fish that moved on the shore; and a tall, grave-
looking young man, a friend and neighbour,
Maurice Lewellyn, leaned against the rocky steps
that led from the garden of The Home to the sea-
shore. -
Presently Beatrice called to the dog, which
leaped caressingly to her hand, “Come, doggie,”
she said, “Come, Owen,—let us have a race along
the level sands. Let us see who will run a mile
and win. Maurice Lewellyn shall be umpire; he
was made for an umpire, he is so grave; one, two,
three, and away !”

Laughing as they started, the young brother
and sister set off full speed, their white teeth
glittering with that smile peculiar to southern
blood, their soft eager eyes full of sunshine
and mirth. The boy tossed his cap back to
Mariana, sitting tranquil among her little house-
hold preparations, and ran bareheaded by the
side of the smiling Atalanta who had challenged
him. Her white dress fluttered on the breeze, her
strange “mermaid” head-dress,—hair and seaweed
confused and intermingled,—shone in the evening
sun, now burnished brassy brown, now crimson
and green and yellow. The stretch of bright sands
lay before them, skirted on one side by a calm
blue sea specked with snowy sails; and on the
other by broken rocky banks, sweet with the
perfume of honeysuckle and travellers' joy. The
evening light touched every object with glory.
Swiftly they flew over the sands, those two merry
young creatures, and the great heavy handsome
Newfoundland dog. Suddenly Beatrice turned,
and flew back like a white sea-gull to the little
cove where her sister sat.
“I thought I should win!” said she, laughing
and panting, as she dropped on her knees.

Owen stopped, and shouted “Shame!” with a
breathless smile. The dog went careering on,
then halted, looked round, and ran back barking
and bounding to his mistress.
“Your pardon, doggie, for cheating you,” said
the laughing girl, as she patted his forehead. “I
said we would run a mile, and I have run half
a mile out and half a mile back.”
“What does the umpire say?” asked Owen.
“The umpire thinks Beatrice a little unprin-
cipled cheat,” said the young man with a grave
smile. “And now let her rest and take tea :
her cheeks are as flushed as the sky. Let her
rest, and watch that lovely sight opposite.”
They did watch, while a yacht which stood as
close in to the shore as her draught of water would
permit, nearly opposite their place of merry-
making, slackened sail, – and then putting off
its cockle-shell of a boat, landed, within a yard
or two of their stairs, a young gentleman who,
without further ceremony than lifting his hat,
advanced rapidly to the group and accosting
Captain Brooke with easy courtesy, asked if there
was not a short cut to Treherne House some-
where thereabouts.

“Yes,” said Captain Brooke. “Up these steps
and through my garden there is a very short way
to the house you want—not that I have much
acquaintance with the inmates of the house,
though we claim cousinhood.”
“Do you?” said the stranger. “I claim cou-
sinhood too, and have landed to see them. My
name is Treherne—Montagu Treherne.”
“My name is Gaveston Brooke,” said the old
officer smiling. “And now we have gone through
the ceremony of introduction, will you pause a
little on the sands while we take tea, and I will
accompany you myself as guide afterwards. Let
me present my son to you, and my daughters.”
Marian smiled and bowed. Beatrice was ashamed
of her flushed cheeks and her absurd head-dress;
and while she also bowed she made several private
attempts to pull the seaweed out of her hair, and
restore order to her curls;—not from vanity—she
was not thinking of her beauty—but because she
felt ashamed of appearing before a stranger like a
romping untidy child. She soon recovered her
embarrassment, however, and laughed and blushed
when taxed with her disloyal endeavours to alter
the “mermaid head-dress” sacred to the day.

“Not a mermaid, but a syren,” Captain Treherne
said. “The mermaids are ugly creatures like seals,
I have seen several.”
“And the syrens?”
“I have not seen the syrens, but I conjecture
them to be exactly like the young ladies now
drinking tea in this cove on the sea-shore.”
And so with foolish jesting and happy talk the
young party loitered through another hour of the
sweet declining sunset. And Beatrice forgot the
remaining droops of seaweed in her hair, and
shook them back merrily with her curls, and
poured the tea out into large conch-shells, and
bid the party drink out of them to Owen's
health, and made the large dog leap extraordinary
leaps for minute fragments of biscuit, and bor-
rowed her brother's telescope to look at the
yacht as it stood off and on with slack sails
alternately white and pink in the sunset, and
helped her sister to pack up the picnic cups and
saucers and shells and flowers, and clapped her
hands as a signal for the little parlour-maid of
The Home to come down the rugged steps and
take the basket and cloth away.
And all she did, even that which seemed

almost childish, was done with that unspeakable
grace which makes trifles charming. Com-
menting on which, her brother Owen said she
was what an old Scotch ballad termed a
“freakish fay,” and declared that he remem-
bered one of her freaks, riding through the
apple orchards that skirt the way to Wiesbaden;
when she rode on impatiently in front of her
party, and notched a piece out of the cheeks of
countless apples as she went along,-by way of
showing which route she had taken.
And now it was determined that it was getting
late, and the party turned homewards; but first
they loitered along the shore to the spot where
the yacht's boat was lying, that Captain Treherne
might give some orders before he accompanied
Captain Brooke on the way to Treherne House.
And as they neared the boat he said, “I have a
fellow among my crew with a voice like a nightin-
gale, and I will make him sing you a song about
a syren.”
They turned the corner of the rock where the
men were waiting; one of them lying on his broad
chest like a lazy seal. “Now, Ratty,” said
Treherne, as the young sailor started to his feet

and made a not ungraceful salutation to the
ladies, “you are to sing that song for us, which
Lady Eudocia Wollingham heard on board the
yacht at Cowes.”
Ratty looked doubtfully up, then smiled;
and then, without further preface, in a voice that
would have called old Incledon's ghost out of the
tomb, sang as follows:–
It was a captin, bold and gay,
As was loved by many a maiden,
In a merchant ship he sailed away
With gold and good stuff laden;
Until he came to an island fair
Where the syrens were disportin',
And he seed one combing of her hair,
And her he fell a courtin’.
Then he vowed the vow as he always vowed
When to win was his endeavour : –
“A Hadmiral of you might be proud,
And I’ll love you my love for hever!”
But when his sailing time was come
Away this captin started,
And he left the syren in her home,
Alone and broken-hearted.
*
Then she callèd Neptune, king of the sea,
Who rose at her commandin’;
“That captin has deceived me,
* * *
Prewent his ever landin'.

So the stormy wind came on to blow,
With the lightning and the thunder,
And the ship tossed high, and the ship tossed low,
Till she sank the deep waves under!
And when the storm was overpast
And the wind lulled on the billow,-
That captin false he floated past
With a wave for his head pillow!
Now captins gay that sails the seas
To love's delights aspirin',
Deceive what simple maids you please
But don't deceive a syren.
Having sung these stanzas with the gravity of
a judge and the shyness of a school-girl, Ratty
retired a step or two behind his companions, and
waited further orders.
“Don’t you know any serious song, Ratty?”
said the young midshipman —“something more
sentimental? I’m quite shocked at the conduct
of that water-witch. Sing us a real love-song.”
“Well, I do know a little bit of a song, sir,
but there's not much in it beyond the tune. They
call it “Out at Sea.’”
Phoebe dear, your quiet eyes
Shine on me;
With the evening star they rise,
Out at sea!

Rippling o'er my ocean track
Their beauty gleams;
Midnight watches bring them back,
And daylight dreams.
All I hope, and all I fear,
Loved by thee,
Haunts my heart, oh, Phoebe dear!
Out at sea!
There was, as Ratty said, nothing in the words;
and yet the sweet clear manly voice, the utter
simplicity with which it was sung, the hour, the
soft calm sunset, the atmosphere of youth and
happiness around that birthday party, gave some-
thing to the song it had not in itself; and when
Treherne, looking at the furled sails of his own
yacht, murmured the words “Out at Sea,” Beatrice
blushed.
She had no reason for blushing; she was
extremely angry with herself for it—it embar-
rassed her; but she hoped it was not noticeable,
and she looked shyly away from the rest of
the party to her sister's face, as if seeking for calm
there. For calm was the very essence of Mariana's
beauty; and her large reverential eyes were fixed
on the evening star at that moment with a sort
of answering light. And on her eyes, and not on

any other star, were fixed the grave glances of
Maurice Lewellyn.
So they strolled home; and the girls and
Owen went in, and their father and Maurice
undertook to guide Captain Treherne to Tre-
herne House. As the young midshipman threw
himself on the cushions in the bay-window,
where the moon already poured down a silver
light as in a picture, he said, “Well, if ever I
saw a fellow who was like Apollo in the heathen
mythology, Captain Treherne is the man. I
never saw such a handsome fellow ! Did you see,
Beatrice, when the wind took his hair and the
light of the sunset was on his face? he was like
the figure of Phaëton, but grander—like Apollo.
Don’t you think he is like Apollo, Beatrice?”
And Beatrice laughed, and said, “She had
never seen Apollo, and therefore could not judge
of the resemblance;” but Beatrice blushed again,
only she cared less for the fact than before, be-
cause there was no light but the moon, and no
one by to see. -
But she stood at the window so long that at
last the gentle hand of her sister touched her
shoulder, telling her it was time to go to rest.

And Captain Brooke came in, and the “Good

happy little circle again fell like dew on the
closing flowers; and the hush of prayer preceded
the hush of sleep in the happy Home.

LOVE,
I MAY as well inform the reader at once that these
two young people “fell in love with one another at
first sight,” as it is phrased. A method of estab-
lishing a preference which is unintelligible to
some and condemned by others, but which never-
theless from time to time asserts its triumphant
claim to be as good a method as any other, by
some happy union which proves that the in-
stinctive suddenness of the choice was no bar
to constancy, nor evidence of shallowness. Not
always so; not often so; for the most part that
love has wings such as Daedalus and Icarus
perished in trying; wings fastened with wax,
that melt in the heat of the noonday sun; and
such preferences as have that sudden rise have
as sudden a cessation—windfalls of the heart's

budding spring—which show as fair as other fruit
for a little while and then drop and are forgotten,
while the slow sure harvest ripens on.
But Beatrice and Montagu Treherne did, as I
say, “fall in love at first sight,” and anyone but
simple Captain Brooke would have seen that they
did so. He did not see it. His life was passed in
early days in the busy energy of a soldier's career,
and since those days in the narrow home circle we
have described. Worldly calculations and worldly
experiences were entirely out of his line. If
he had been the most acute of chaperons he
would have altered nothing in the easy permission
to Montagu and Beatrice to pass their days to-
gether, nor would it have appeared to Captain
Brooke the least unlikely, or undesirable to the
family of the young man, that he, being heir to
an earldom, should marry the little Welsh girl
Beatrice Brooke. But he never thought at all
about the matter: he found Montagu an agreeable
addition to the family circle, and his calculation
did not go beyond. Everybody was satisfied.
They claimed cousinhood after the manner of the
young Frenchman who said it was a variable
species of relationship—where, if you liked the

lady, you said “ma cousine,” and if you disliked
or were indifferent, “une cousine à moi.”
Montagu was extremely glad to be cousin to
Beatrice Brooke—indeed he insisted more on this,
than the much nearer cousinhood that existed be-
tween him and the beautiful golden-haired brood
of first cousins, daughters of Lady Eudocia Wol-
lingham of Treherne House, whom he had osten-
sibly landed to visit, and between whom and the
Brookes some sort of intimacy had sprung up
since his arrival. As much intimacy as Lady
Eudocia could condescend to, for she was a very
great lady indeed, and held that the egg-shell china
of which she was made should not be set on the
same shelf with the rough pottery of God's
other creatures. Indeed she had been heard in
conversation with a female friend to rebut the
generally received axiom that “all men are
equals in the sight of heaven,” by the single
phrase, “Such nonsense you know, my dear; as if
they could be !” and the five golden-haired
daughters were trained in their mother's creed.
She had no son: five Disappointments, as she
called her girls, had alone blessed her union with
the deceased Mr. Wollingham, and the stately

widow had her own dreams of collateral mother-
hood when she invited Captain Treherne to pay a
visit in his yacht to Tenby, whither she had re-
paired for the sea-bathing of the least robust of
her progeny.
Nothing is so obstinate as the behaviour of
babies in these cases of heirdom of titles. Where
it is of no consequence whatever whether girls or
boys should be born, both sexes carelessly enter
the world, or a series of saucy little males merrily
lay claim to their share of the world's great
scramble; but when, as in the case of the earldom
of Caërlaverock, it is of unspeakable consequence
that “the next should be a boy,”—pertinacious
girls come wailing to their cradles; the cockades
provided by hopeful mother and sanguine nurse
are laid aside; and the cackling of joy is changed
to sighs and murmurs.
Considering the very numerous additions to the
Treherne family, the babies of that race had shown
more than common rebellion. The generation
immediately preceding this, had been composed
of seven sisters. The justly incensed old Earl,
their father, in vain endeavoured to set matters
right by a confused and intricate will, limiting

the descent of the fortune as far as he could, to
any male heir who should marry out of the stock
of female heirs. That celebrated old king of
Britain, Brutus with the Blue Shield, – who,
having thirty daughters to provide for, sent
twenty-nine of them to Silvius, King of Italy, to
be given to the noblest men descended from the
nation of Troy, — was only one degree more
puzzled than the Earl of Caërlaverock in the dis-
posal of his girls.
The seven sisters were all handsome but one.
Tall fine brunettes, with glad glittering eyes and
good complexions; and when in process of time
these ladies became handsome old maids, or
handsome elderly matrons, you could still see
how beautiful they had been, -in eyes whose long
shining had kept the glitter and lost the glad-
mess; and in complexions carefully copied from
the originals once in their possession, which they
(and few other persons of their generation) re-
membered in their first freshness.
Lady Eudocia had been the Beauty, and the
favourite. In all families, as in all congregated
masses, herds of animals, and groups of people,
there is one who is leader—you scarce know why.

It is not always the cleverest—it is rarely the
most amiable—for goodness and generosity have
much yielding in them. A strong will and some
adventitious advantages will often give the posi-
tion which habit confirms, and which no one
thinks of disputing. In families of girls, “the
Beauty” is generally the ruler of the house. Let
those who have small eyes and red hands cast
up accounts, and help in little household drud-
geries. Let those who have snub noses which
redden with cold in winter, fetch the Beauty's
shawl and look out her music for her, but let
Beauty herself serenely enjoy the lovely corporeal
covering given her by heaven, and live that life
among the roses which is fitted for her till she
marries the Prince of the fairy tale.
Lady Eudocia had lived that life. She was
accustomed to consider that the roses were her
share, and the thorns the share of other people.
The only thorn she knew in earlier life was that
her elder sister was mother of the first male
heir in the whole Treherne brood; and there was
no resenting it, for the poor soul died when the
boy was born, leaving that welcome spark of male

life to replace her own insignificant female exist-
ence in the craving family.
The second of the seven sisters was ugly—the
Cinderella of the set. She was christened Diana,
but went by the name of Dumpty, and, being
eight-and-twenty, was considered quite an old
maid. She was short; she was vulgar-looking;
she was, as her mother ceaselessly informed her,
“horribly like her father,” a rich West Indian
proprietor whom the family had condescended to
marry and had long since forgotten. Her eyes
alone redeemed the plainness of her face; some-
thing fond and wistful and intelligent was in
them, as if looking for love and companionship
that she never could find. She it was, who did
all the small nondescript tasks; looked out and
copied songs, sat up with any who were sick, cast
up accounts, embroidered her sisters' names in
the corner of their handkerchiefs, and took the
dogs for a run when it was too cold for the com-
plexions of the rest of the family.
She found both companionship and love, how-

to have utterly disgraced her noble origin! It
so happened that Eudocia fell sick. Beauty had

the small-pox. Anything like the confusion this
created in the family was never seen before. The
handsome sisters were packed off instanter for
fear they should take the disease. The mother
of that generation of “ disappointments ” wrung
her hands with dismay at the chance of the love-
liest of those seven faces being blurred and
marked. Dumpty was set to watch day and
night, besides a professional nurse to wait on the
sufferer. When Beauty recovered Dumpty fell
ill; and having endured extreme fatigue in at-
tendance on her sister, matters went rather hard
with her; but she too recovered, and all went on
as usual.
One day, soon after her convalescence was com-
plete, Dumpty was in the library. She was
sitting, perched up on the library steps, reading
the martyrdom of Christopher Norton in the
“Phoenix Britannicus;” stooping over the strange
old book, extremely chilled, her nose red and
her fingers blue. Presently her mother called
from the drawing-room—“Is that you, my child,
sitting in the cold?” To which Dumpty judi-
ciously, though ungrammatically, replied—“No,
mamma,—it's only me; ” being aware that of

course “my child” meant Beauty. But Mr.
Bertie Lewellyn, the doctor, came smiling through
the open door, and said, “Well, but it is too cold
for “only me;’ “only me’ should not read in the
dusk, because it is bad for the eyes, especially
after such an illness.”
Dumpty looked up, and shut her book, and
smiled, and felt flurried. Oddly enough, she had
just been thinking of Mr. Lewellyn — thinking
how he would have borne the pain of martyrdom,
and thinking how kind and skilful he was: what a
gentle cheerful voice he had; how clever he looked;
and how pleasant it had been during her illness
to seem a “first object” for a while; and Dumpty
gave a little quiet sigh, as she thought of resuming
her habitual position as Nobody. Now, as the
physician spoke to her, she felt, as I have said, a
little flurried, as though she had been surrepti-
tiously thinking of him without his leave; and
though she shut her book, she remained awkwardly
enough sitting on her perch on the library steps,
till Mr. Lewellyn came forward and offered his
hand to help her down, saying with a smile,
“‘Only me’ is in great want of some one to take
as good care of her as she does of other people.”

And when he had said this, a very visible change
came over his countenance, and he spoke so very
much quicker than usual, and what he did say
was so extraordinary, that Dumpty was glad to
drop off her perch into the chair he drew for
her: for she made out with a beating heart that
he was expressing his excessive admiration of her
unselfish character; his conviction that she would
be the blessing of any man's home; and his hope,
though his position was not one that could satisfy
a worldly mind, that he was the identical man
whose home she would condescend to bless |
How her frightened little senses ever took this
meaning in she hardly knew, and what she an-
swered she hardly guessed; but she became
Mrs. Lewellyn that same winter; and though her
mother and site: were all extremely ashamed of
what she had döne, and never could think of it
without vexation and embarrassment, even when in
process of time Mr. Lewellyn became Sir Bertie
Lewellyn, and a very celebrated physician, yet,
in spite of the disapprobation of the family,
Dumpty was as happy as the day was long, and
so was her husband, and so was her son, the very

Tenby with Captain Brooke's daughters, as we
have already seen.
So Eudocia was married to Mr. Wollingham,
and Dumpty to the “doctor,” as her sisters said
with a contemptuous snort; and Lady Jane
had married her cousin, and died, leaving the
male heir of the family in Captain Treherne;
and two other sisters became old maids, for want
of rich partis, or honest men who thought they
might be, like ugly Dumpty, a blessing in any
home;—and the youngest became Marchioness of
Updown.

what was the destiny also of other people,—for

And though her husband was neither wise nor
great, but a fat foolish man, with a meek fidgety
temper—and there are, as we know, no less than
twenty-one marquises in the British peerage—she
somehow contrived to be the greatest lady that

ever was seen out of a fairy tale. Her sisters
called her The Marchioness, as the servants did.
Her husband called her The Marchioness. It
seemed as if there was no other Marchioness
in the world. As there is a Whale among fishes,
so was this Marchioness among her peers, and
among the minnows of less aristocratic society.
That great Leviathan of the deep was not a whit
more remarkable or superior in the water than
our Marchioness on dry land. If there was a
ball, party, or soirée to be given, her absence was
as bitter as that of the hero of the old-fashioned
song “Robin Adair.” If there was a procession,
coronation, or festive ceremony of any kind, the
world stood still on its axis till the Marchioness
had a place assigned to her. She went to Court
not spangled with scattered diamonds, like the
sky on a fine night, but crusted over with them,
like barnacles on a ship's hull. Diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, turquoises, and pearls were spread over
her, as the farmer spreads lumps of fertilising
lime over his land. “And, like the land, she ap-
peared to thrive under them. Every year her
arms were rounder, her bracelets larger, her figure
more corpulent. Every year the sweep of her

full drapery encroached more and more on the
ground occupied by her scantier-skirted neigh-
bours. Every year her step became more flat-
footed and imperious. In England (or rather in
London, the England of the world of fashion)
she shone with the splendour of a perpetual
Catherine's wheel; and abroad she represented,
in the opinion of amazed foreigners, the style
and condition of an English “grande dame.” In
vain were the French ladies better dressed,
Poles more graceful, Spaniards more beautiful,
Austrians better born, Germans more accom-
plished, Russians more splendid—even in her
own line of jewellery. No matter—The Mar-
chioness entered, and “bore away the bell.”
She had no children. Lady Eudocia was glad
of that. That one circumstance supported her
suffering soul against the bursts of envy which
from time to time afflicted it. She had no
children, that motherly-looking Marchioness;
and it was a soothing thought to her tender
relative.
These, and happy Dumpty, alone remained of
the brilliant sisterhood at the time my story
opens—the two maiden Ladies Treherne having

died within a brief period of each other. There
was not much sorrow for the double event: a
little cloud of black and grey vestments over-
shadowed the bodies of the family for a few
weeks, during which they attended no balls, went
surreptitiously to the play, and sighed gravely
when they met or received acquaintances. At the
end of that time all was again couleur de rose,
and no difference perceptible, except that two
pearl necklaces and an amethyst “parure” had
passed to two of the younger nieces of the
glittering-eyed defunct.
The present holder of the earldom of Caér-
laverock completed the surviving family circle.
He had represented England at various foreign
courts, and by preference resided abroad; a
more elegant or accomplished old goose never
sat through his idle afternoons in a brocaded
silk dressing-gown, with a bell-rope round his
waist. He was eighty-six, but beyond a slight
deafness, he showed no signs of infirmity. He
was alert, peevish, and garrulous of anecdotes,
principally respecting Potemkin and the Russian
court. His wife, who had been a celebrated
Russian beauty, attended him with the most

sedulous care. Buoyed up by a natural gaiety
of temper, her harshest criticism on her selfish
old mate never went beyond the fact that “ce
cher milord has his nerfs a little what you call
taquinés, to-day.” Such as he was, he was
from family circumstances chief of the three
guardians nominated for Montagu Treherne; who
by a clause in his grandfather's will, would not
come of age till he was twenty-six, and could not
marry before that time without the consent of all
three guardians.
Oh! that Will !
The wills of most old gentlemen are some-
what willful, and much must be forgiven to
an old earl, who on the eve of parting with his
“animula, blandula, vagula, comesque,” parted
also with the earldom (scarcely less precious in
his opinion), and reflected, that the man in im-
mediate succession had no children at all, and his
brother only seven daughters; and that out of four-
teen lives, only two sparks of male heirdom ex-
isted—the son of the deceased Lady Jane, and
the son of “the Doctor's wife,” Lady Di
Lewellyn, or Lady Di Pillula, as her sisters
wittily called her. But whatever his excuses

may be, the earl made a will that was the
source of most intense anxiety and tribulation
to his family,– and one result of its provisions
was, that the event of Montagu Treherne's mar-
riage seemed to them the pivot on which the
world’s axis ought to turn.

certain rank, and appear to be choosing out of
the sacred pale of that set, a sort of hue and cry
is instantly raised; the “stop thief” of polite
society whose natural prey he is considered to be
from his position. If he remain a bachelor, it is
generally considered the fault of the reigning
beauty of the day. “If it had not been for that
horrid Mrs. This, or that wicked Lady That, he
would certainly have proposed for Florentina, or
” and Florentina
Emily, or Lucy, or Mary Jane;’
and Mary Jane, on their parts, should they continue
single, always protest that they were “very near”
marrying him, but for circumstances they “do
not like further to allude to.”
And all the while, basely or honestly, pru-
dently or rashly, with fickleness or constancy, the
man is “gangin' his ain gait,” and entirely con-
sulting his own inclinations; as Montagu Treherne
did in the present instance, by falling in love
with Beatrice Brooke.
Lady Eudocia Wollingham had always been
the most tranquil of her nephew's disposers, for
though she did not exactly know the provisions
of her grandfather's will, she knew that what
was desired was that he should marry one of his

cousins. Her five girls were all undeniably beau-
tiful; she took it for granted he would be hus-
band to one of them; and till they were old
enough to come out, she smiled complacently
and visited enthusiastically wherever Treherne's
wandering fancy seemed to lead him.
And when that fancy made a prodigious halt at
the shrine of a certain charming Lady Nesdale,
familiarly called “Milly” Nesdale, Lady Eudocia
took to loving Lady Nesdale very much indeed,
and to calling her “Milly,” as her other friends
did;—and asking her to dinner to meet her nephew
whenever he came, for she thought it would “oc-
cupy” him till the first budding Wollingham
came out,-an event which was now imminent.
She gave him a perpetual ticket to her opera box,
and a place in the open carriage to all races and
breakfasts that he had a mind to; for the deceased
and forgotten Wollingham was very wealthy, and
she had a larger fortune than many duchesses.
So Treherne, on the whole, led a gay pleasant
life, and though he had entered diplomacy in
imitation of his grand-uncle, the Earl, he had
been brought into Parliament for the borough
Mr. Wollingham had formerly represented, and

therefore remained in England, attending “to his
duties” tant bien que mal, during the London
season,-and hunting, yachting, or shooting when
that busy period was over.
Montagu Treherne had also great personal
advantages. Ever since Jane Eyre loved Mr.
Rochester, a race of novel-heroes have sprung up
whose chief merit seems to be that, as “Punch"
expresses it, they could “knock down a Mam-
moth or a Megatherium.” Brutal and selfish in
their ways, and rather repulsive in person, they
are, nevertheless, represented as perfectly ador-
able and carrying all before them, like George
Sand's galley-slave. Treherne belonged to a more
old-fashioned race of heroes. He was, like most
of his family, faultlessly handsome; and that had
its weight with Beatrice Brooke. People may
argue against it as they will, but the instinctive
leaning of inexperienced human nature is to
trust in beauty. “Angels are painted fair.” No
one imagines a squat Venus, a lank-haired scraggy
Eve, or a hunchy, beetle-browed Apollo. An
ugly man may be passionately beloved, and so
may an ugly woman; but the superstition of the
heart remains, nevertheless, through all ages the

same, that to find “a fair face and a false heart”
seems an unnatural union, and that beauty is “a
letter of recommendation,”—however it may lie,
as letters of recommendation often do.
Great, then, was the mutual admiration for each
other of Beatrice and Treherne, and never was there
so merry a love-making or so perfect a trust. The
idea of not being beloved never crossed Montagu
Treherne's mind for an instant. He had never in
his life wooed in vain. His golden hair, his sweet
smile, his pleasant gaiety, his gentlemanlike
bearing, had never failed to please. As to
Beatrice, how should she doubt? what could she

fidence, and Beatrice from the security of in-
nocence. But no word of love was spoken. They
would not have been so happy, perhaps, if that
Rubicon had been passed. They lived that life of
undisturbed daily companionship, which lovers who

have enjoyed it may weigh against the heaviest
after-grief, and still find the balance waver. In that
sunny autumn, what a crowding of remembered
days What rambles along the seashore; what
lingerings and gazings from Philip's seat; what
laughing-talk with the quaint boatmen; what sails
over the bay of Carmarthen; what sketching of
the distant coasts of Glamorgan, Devon, and
Somerset !
What a wild scrambling day that was which
they spent at Saundersfoot, watching the coal
vessels load — the dusk figures of the colliers
against the red evening sky not unlike a tranquil
pandemonium! What a merry party that was to
Patter dockyard, to see the launch of one ship and
the models of others, whose ribs looked as if no
storm could ever break them! How amused they
were the morning they went over to the little
bare island of Caldy—no trees, no scenery, no-
thing but a vast rabbit-warren—rabbits peeping
up from their holes and skipping back into them;
rabbits teeming and thriving in spite of continual
massacre, a massacre which consigned so many of
them to death in the war-time, that the owner of
the island is said to have made three hundred

pounds in one year by selling their skins for
soldiers' caps. What a delicious moonlight shone
over their way that day in September, when they
rode back from Pembroke Castle by the village of
Pynally and Giltar, after sitting out on the top of
the ruined castle quoting scraps of history, and
trying to remember dates !
And that picnic to St. Catherine's Isle, could
they ever forget it? or the great storm that
overtook them one Saturday at the ruins of
Lawrenny, when all the umbrellas but one
were blown inside out, and Owen’s round hat
flew as high as a seagull and out of sight?
Or that other day, sultry and calm, when they
visited the great ruined court of Carew Castle
planning how to rebuild and inhabit it, with a
splendour worthy of Queen Elizabeth's day? Or
that pleasant drive to Stackpoole Court, when Lady
Eudocia went to call on the Cawdor family, and
the rest walked about the park? Or, better yet,
the ride along the road called the Ridgeway, with
the bold rocky shore on one side, and the rich
vale of Florence on the other — that day when
Beatrice found her pony so restive, and Tre-
herne got down and resettled the bit, looking

up in her smiling face to see if she were
frightened?
Or (dearest of all !) that day when nothing hap-
pened which anyone would remember but their two
selves—the day they stood looking at the tomb of
John Moore, of Moorhanger, Devon, who died for
love in 1639, having come unsuccessfully a-court-
ing to a second wife; and Owen read the inscription
and laughed, and asked if Treherne believed it
possible a man could die of love; and Treherne
said it was quite possible “if he was not beloved
again; ” and Beatrice felt he was looking at her,
though she dared not look up!
Ah! who has not such days to remember?
When the softness of affection was in the tones that
have since said unimaginable bitternesses, or been
silenced for ever by death: when trifles told us
we were all in all to each other: and every sight or
sound in Nature was one link more in the golden
chain that bound us together;—that strong in-
visible chain, whose breaking strands the anchor
of our life's hope;—and leaves us to drift over
trackless seas.

CHAPTER V.
LADY DIANA LEWELLYN.
IN October the days began to get stormy and
cold, and Captain Brooke was much from home, and
anxious and low-spirited at times. Some specu-
lation in coal-mines and iron-works in which he
had been persuaded to take shares, and through
which he had sanguinely expected to give his
children “very pretty portions,” had gone wrong
through the mismanagement or dishonesty of .
some of the parties concerned, and there was the
usual amount of difficulty in unravelling accounts
and ascertaining the exact condition of affairs.
But though there was less riding and sailing,
from the two combined causes of the war of the
elements and the troubles of fortune, Beatrice
and Treherne were not less together. Sir Bertie
Lewellyn came every year for a stated period to
Tenby, and it was to his skill as a physician,

(though she affected to scorn him as a relation)
that Lady Eudocia trusted for the life of the
pleasantest and loveliest of all her lovely girls,
Helen Wollingham.
Helen was born the very same day as Beatrice
Brooke; and they made out of that, as young
girls will, a plea for a little romance of friendship,
more than existed between the other sisters and
Beatrice, more than would have been suffered to
exist had Lady Eudocia been aware of it. But
it was principally at her “Aunt Dumpty’s” that
Helen saw Beatrice. Lady Diana Lewellyn was
not so addicted to “condescending” as her grander
sister, and she received the Brooke girls with the
frankest pleasure, and not without a tender in-
stinct that in the meek and pious elder girl she
saw the hoped-for bride of her only son. They
all met there – Maurice Lewellyn and Marian,
Beatrice and Helen and Treherne. They sang
and practised and read together, while Sir Bertie
was making professional visits, and Captain
Brooke was taking long rides, or attending
meetings about the unlucky iron-works.
Aunt “Dumpty,” as she was still called, was
very agreeable. It might be said of her, as Rush

formerly said of Jeremy Taylor, that her con-
versation “had all the pleasantness of a comedy
and all the usefulness of a sermon.” Her whole
nature was of the sunniest degree of cheerfulness
and warmth; her welcome seemed to quadruple
the welcome given by usual people. She amused
the young people, too, by odd scraps of quaint
information about Wales and its former history.
She had not lost her love of ancient books, though
she no longer perched on the library steps to read
them. She culled from the old laws of Wales,
strange rules now forgotten. The confused sort
of mercy without a poor-law, which enacted
that a man should stand free from punishment
for theft of meat, if he could prove that he was
a necessitous man and exiled—that he had been
three days and three nights without lodging and
without alms, and had passed three townships
and nine houses in each township unrelieved, and
in the words of Hood, had

the puzzle of dog-stealers, –that there was one
animal whose value might advance from four-
pence to a pound the same day. A buckhound,
should he be owned by a boor in the morning,
his value was fourpence; should he be given to
a baron his value was half a pound; but if the
King owned him before night, his value was a
pound !
She told them how, in the days of Welsh
bards and Welsh harpists, the harp of a chief
musician was of exactly the same value as an oak
...tree; and for the price of two tuning keys to
the harp you might buy a coble boat. And how by
a quaint rule of superiority it was decreed, that if
the KING had a desire for poetry, the chief of song
should sing two songs— one addressed to God,
and the other to the chieftains: but if the QUEEN
desired that amusement in her chamber, the do-
mestic bard was to sing for her “three verses
concerning Camlan in a low voice, lest the
family be disturbed !”
Yet that which in England in our day is ex-
tremely rare, and even among foreigners is only
occasional—the skill of performing instrumental
music—was then reckoned part of the usual educa-

tion of a gentleman; and a young Welshman who
could not play a prelude on the harp, and give
an extempore stanza, would be like a man who in
the present day could not make a bow or dance a
5
quadrille. “Canu can pedwar acceunu,” or to
sing music in four parts properly, was reckoned
one of “the four and twenty games” a well-
educated Gaul should excel in; and most satis-
factory to authors, poets, and composers, is the
account given of the effect of some of these
chaunts. Rhys Meigen, for instance, is stated to
have dropped down dead at hearing a philosophic
ode recited which had been written against him
by the celebrated Dafydd ap Gwilym!
Worse than poor sore-hearted Keats, who died
of reviewers; or even the matron of Rugby, who is
said to have committed suicide from dejection at
believing herself pointed at as the matron in that
most perfect of juvenile fictions “Tom Brown's
School Days.”
She read them the account of the old Lord of
Kemes, a Pembrokeshire worthy, who lived to the
age of one hundred and five, always in health;
and at ninety-nine, his servant making some
mistake in bringing his horse, the impatient non-

agenarian set out and walked twenty miles home.
He is also said to have eaten a handful of nuts,
shells and all, a few years before his death, and
to have carried all his teeth to the grave with
him.
More romantic was the account given of the
Welsh saint, Saint David — a remarkably hand-
some man, and a friend of King Arthur's, who
built twelve monasteries, was Archbishop for
sixty-five years, and lived to a hundred and forty-
seven. And Owen of Kemes says he does not
himself believe, but merely tells it “to recreate
the reader's spirits,” that the reason the nightin-
gale's song is never heard in Pembrokeshire is
that Saint David was so disturbed when saying
his evening prayers by “the sweete tunings of
the nightengall,” and so “letted (or hindered) by
the melodie of that bird,” that he piously en-
treated of heaven that none might sing evermore
within his diocese !
More interesting still to her youthful audience
was that account—by the reading of which Aunt
Dumpty beguiled a rainy day—of “the real story
of Lear and Cordelia.” Beatrice had never been
to the play; but she was well acquainted with


## p. 51 (#67) ##############################################

LOST AND SAVED, 51
Shakspeare, and breathlessly she listened to the
story of her favourite heroine. How Lear (or
Llyr) was son to the celebrated King Bleiddud,
who built the city of Bath, dedicated its healing
waters to Minerva, and was “never at rest from
devising works of ingenuity,” till at last, like
Icarus in fabulous times, and Mr. Cocking in later
days, he imagined he had invented a parachüte
in the form of a pair of wings, and was dashed to
pieces attempting to descend from a high tower
in London.
How the story of the strange adventures of
his son Llyr had been followed by Shakspeare
closely enough in the beginning, but not to the
end; the dramatic unities requiring a more sud-
den catastrophe than in truth took place: for,
in the real history, the King of France gave
such effectual aid to the insulted old King (not
only giving him troops, but sending Cordelia with
them, for fear the French soldiery would not
obey Llyr) that the outraged monarch chased
his two sons-in-law out of the kingdom and
reigned in quiet to the end of his days. But
Cordelia receiving news of her husband's death
in the midst of her father's successes, would not

return to France, and remained with Llyrtill he
died. Then, and not till then, poor Cordelia's
fortunes changed. Conquered by her sister's two
sons, the Princes of Scotland and Cornwall, she
stabbed herself in prison, unable to endure her
reverses; whereby (as the old chronicler, Geoffrey
of Monmouth, says) “she lost her soul!”
And all this happened, adds the chronicler,
before Rome was built, or Isaiah and Hosea
began to prophecy.

EROS AND ANTEROS.
So, in such ridings, singings, and talkings, did
that happy autumn at Tenby pass away ! Does
the enumeration of them seem tedious to the
reader? They seemed anything but tedious to
the parties concerned. And if Ilinger over them,
it is that I cannot bear to carry Beatrice past
those bright days to the future darkening before
her! I cannot bear to hurry her over that calm
time when Montagu Treherne went out with the
Brooke family (at twilight hours appropriated by
the London world of fashion to dining in hot
rooms, curtained with heavy draperies, and steam-
ing with the mingled odours of savoury meats,
perfumed fruits and choice wines) to see the
Welsh harvesters dance in the open air; and
sauntered home again along the shore, watching

over the darkening sea; and even then, instead
of saying “Good evening,” lingered and waited
till instead of “Good evening,” they all said
“Good night.”
I cannot bear to hurry past even the few stormy
and wet days that came rather to vary than to mar
their pleasures. Shut in the pleasant prison of
the enchanting little “Home”— or in the well-
furnished library-room at Lewellyn Lodge; or
going out perhaps in a gleam of storm-sunlight to
see the great fresh waves dash upon the shore,
and the ships bend and dip their sails like sea-
birds' wings in the tyrannous blast;—and then
run up the well-known rocky stair from the
sands beneath, with the rain dripping from the
light waterproof cloaks and round hats of the
girls, and the fresh cool bloom of colour deepen-
ing in their cheeks. Days when poor Beatrice
thought that since the demigods of heathendom
there surely never had been anything like Mon-
tagu seen upon earth; and Montagu, on his part,
considered, that whether in her simple riding-
habit, on her cream-coloured Hanoverian pony, -
or in her little fishing-boots and short linsey-
woolsey petticoat,-or in floating white muslin

dress and simply braided hair, or plain straw-hat,
under the drooping shadow of whose brim her
lovely eyes shone like sunlight from under a
forest bough—he had never seen so enchanting
a creature!
And most people would have been of Treherne's
opinion. Beatrice was not only beautiful—not
only had that nameless grace which goes by the
name of “charm”—not only was she playful and
coaxing (poor English synonymes for the French
terms caressante and folátre), but quick, ardent,
and sensitive; capable of all sacrifice for those
she loved; capable of all energy for that which
she desired to attain; full of eagerness; full of
enthusiasm; pitiful and tender.
Something of a rarer earnestness was in her
than in others, and warmed you while she spoke,
like a flame.
It is in vain to argue the matter: there is as
much difference of sensation in different persons
as there is difference in their physical strength or
intellectual capacities. One can’t draw,-another
can’t sing,-and a third can’t feel. There are
apathetic creatures to whom passionate love, wild
grief, aching compassion, are mysteries as great

as magic. Disturbed; embarrassed; incredulous;
with a strong repugnance to what they call “a
scene,”—they shrink like sea-anemones, and draw
in the cold flabby feelers of their minds at any
evidence of emotion in others.
Beatrice was the reverse of all this. She
enjoyed more, she suffered more, she felt more,
than a great proportion of her fellow-creatures.
Life thrilled through her, as you may see it
thrill, in the delight of sunshine, through a
butterfly's closed wings. And to such as she,
in whom the visible world and the life of sen-
sation predominate, the temptations of this world
are the most powerful. Her heart ached, the
tears rushed into her eyes, at some touching
picture or some mournful song. The breath of
a warm spring day, the scent of flowers, the
purple of the distant hills, the freshness of the
waves dashing in upon the shore, filled her with
vague yearning.
With her gentle sister and loving father
nothing of all this had been controlled; nor,
with her joyous kindly pliant temper, did
it seem to them that anything required con-
trolling. They delighted in her,-as she in

them. She was the pet of The “Home.” She
had lived a shadowless life. Not even an illness
had ever come to bring languor to that eager
brow, or weakness to that alert and graceful form.
Who can wonder with all this that Beatrice was
merry? Merry she was, and witty too. When
she and Aunt Dumpty and Helen Wollingham
and Treherne chatted together at Lewellyn Lodge,
what a joyous party it seemed ! What a laugh
Beatrice had ! How Helen Wollingham loved it
and echoed it; and sometimes paused and sighed,
and wondered if her mother, Lady Eudocia, had
ever been merry like Aunt Dumpty when she was
younger; when she had not merely that undula-
tion of the painted lips, which one of her children
aptly called “mamma's company smile.”
Beatrice was very accomplished too. What-
ever she attempted, she did well. She played
brilliantly; she sang to the little Welsh harp
with the voice of a syren. She wrote excellent
poetry; she composed music to her own words;
she sketched from nature with a degree of skill
many professed artists might have envied. And
with all that, as she laughingly said of herself,
“ of so notable an industry” that the borders of

all the curtains in the little sunny drawing-room
and dining-room of The “Home” were of her
own tapestry work |
Such was Beatrice: and Owen was Beatrice
turned into a boy. The same face, a little prouder
and bolder; the same dark passionate eyes, with
a certain dash of saucy merriment in them which
his sister's had not; the same quick earnest
glances, like the sun coming from under a
suddenly-lifted forest bough; and the same free
kindly temper and warm affections.
And Mariana 2 Mariana, in Maurice Lewellyn's
opinion, was the paragon of that dear home. The
tranquil Mariana, not the brilliant Beatrice. She
too was beautiful, but it was the ideal of the face
of a nun. Pure and quiet; with eyes that had
something in them of the far-off shining of the
stars, seeming while she bent them on you
and listened to your discourse, as though they
spared time from some inward abstract thought,
which had nothing to do with you—nothing to do
with earth. And with the saintly face went the
saintly heart. Religion was the very essence of
her being, the life within her life—not the reli-
gion of ecstasy, but the religion of peace. Per-

haps the dim remembrance of the stormy griefs
that had surrounded her infancy, made her “cleave
unto peace.” It was an instinct with her. Often
had she listened when Captain Brooke was talking
of old campaigns with some companion, and
thought of her poor mother, and the father she
could not remember—wounded and dying! The
fierce bayonets; the trampling cavalry; the burn-
ing villages; the bursting mines; the “diapason of
the cannonade;”—the strife that made orphans
and widows; the victories under whose standards
of gorgeous tints the black crape fell in many a
home that never more put on joy:—these pictures
haunted her as though they had been, as old wives
believe, the inheritance of her mother's thoughts
ere yet she herself saw the light.
With deep tender attachment she loved her
stepfather, and called him father, even as
Beatrice did:
For thou to me hast all the father been

was the grateful thought of her heart. Her life
was spent in those careful charities which a
narrow income does not make impossible where

there is a willing mind. Steady and unceasing
was her personal attendance on the poor: not
flinging tracts and warnings into their cottages,
but coming to them in sickness and sorrow,
gentle, patient, and consoling—“not disdaining,”
in the beautiful words of Dr. Guthrie, “to em-
ploy her feet in offices that have employed angels'
wings.”
Maurice Lewellyn had loved her ever since he
was a boy; but he was awed by her. He had
never yet put into words the dream of his life.
Lately he had thought of it. His career was
fixed; he had been called to the bar; not liking
his father's profession, for which he was originally
intended; and the image of that sweet calm face,
not less holy as a wife and mother than now in its
virgin grace, accompanied him in the hush of
study and the busy outward life. He would ask
her; he meant to ask her this very autumn,
before he returned to London to his rooms in the
\emple.
For partings now were the order of the day!
Lady Eudocia and all the Wollinghams except
Helen, were already gone, and Helen was to
follow with Aunt Dumpty when Sir Bertie went

to the Hague, where he had promised to go at
the earnest request of his only brother, dying
there of a painful complaint. Treherne had also
departed. The lovely yacht in which so many
pleasure-sailings had been made, was sent round
to Plymouth with only her smart crew on board;
and its owner was making a whole tour of autumn
visits in Scotland.
He wrote Beatrice a letter. He wanted a
song she and Mariana had sung together; and
though indeed he might have got the song from
a music-shop, or even from his Wollingham
cousins who also sang it, these expedients
did not seem to have occurred to him : so he
wrote to Beatrice; and she copied the music with
wonderful neatness, and wrote out the words
like print, and fastened the sheets together
With blue Satin ties, and wrote a note with it;
borrowing Owen's seal—a ship with “nihil negli-
gendum” out of compliment to the memory of the
vanished yacht—and sealed it carefully, and sent
it off, feeling it quite an event to have written

he had paid, and narrating how many head of
game he had killed; and he put a P.S. men-
tioning that he thought of taking Tenby “in
his way back to London” —a route, the cir-
cuitousness of which he alluded to merely to
comment on the extreme facility which the system
of railways afforded in reducing distances to
“nothing.”
He did come. He did pay that visit. He
learned that Captain Brooke might possibly be
obliged to come to London in the spring, on
account of the various perplexities which had
arisen in the mining affairs, which were now
alas! in the hands of law agents. He thought
Beatrice more charming than ever, and she
spoke of the certainty of their meeting in London
with eager and unconcealed joy. So they parted;
happy, and conscious of mutual love.
Not so Maurice Lewellyn and Mariana. He
proposed indeed (which Treherne did not do), but
Mariana rejected his suit: if, indeed, the term
“rejection” can be applied to the calm gentleness
of her denial: listening to which, Maurice felt as
if in some sad dream he had been rowed away on
a placid sea from some blessed shore which he

knew he might never see again. She spoke, as a
much older woman might have done, of life and
its duties; of her conviction that Captain Brooke
was suffering from great and acute anxiety; so that,
even had she loved Maurice, she would not have
left her stepfather. But she felt for Maurice
nothing of that love—nothing but the regard of a
friend—a deep and true regard–nothing more.
She did not think she ever would feel a different
sort of love; she did not expect ever to marry.
If she had been a Roman Catholic, as her mother
was, she would have wished to enter some con-
vent. As it was, God, who appointed to all their
paths in life, had shown her where her duty
lay. Her duty as she conceived it, was to remain
with the man who had so tenderly fulfilled the
vow of protection made to her dying father on
the field of battle. To be a comfort to him, even
if she could be no help. She ended by very
earnestly entreating Maurice Lewellyn to take
that decision as final; and not waste youth and
hope in expectation of change in her views (as
he proposed to do), but to look away from the
past into the future, where he also had his
tasks assigned; and strive to fulfil the hopes

his father and mother formed for him, of a
career of usefulness and distinction. She gave
him her hand as she spoke the last sentence; and
for those few seconds they stood, as though they
had been indeed plighting their troth. Plight-
ing troth l ah, bitter moment: moment of sick
shrinking of a heart thrown back on itself
in all its manly earnestness of offering! As
he stood there, pale and thrilled with that
desperate pang, and looked in her calm face,
full of all delicate strength and holy purpose,
but empty—ohl empty of the love he had so
yearned for—he felt that beneath their joined
hands the gulf of a whole world divided their souls.
He went out from her presence, and wandered on
the shore. Long, long he wandered, till the stars
came out—the stars, so like her eyes—so pure,
so cold, so far! He went home and entered softly
into his mother's room. He wound his arms
round her for the good-night embrace, he laid
his cheek against hers, and as he did so he mur-
mured, “Oh! mother, it is not to be l’”
And she said in a tone of soft pity and anxious
love, “Never, my Maurice?”
And he answered, “Never.”

London; with its crowded streets, full of busy
bees and idle drones—swarming, crawling, mov-

dresses, in labouring mechanics’ suits, in dapper
holiday attire, in squalid filthy rags. London,
full of carriages, cabs, waggons, carts, drays, and
loaded omnibuses; with drivers shouting, swear-

feeble, quiet or restive, are to drag their vehicles

babes, hired for the day to stir the sluggish heart
to pity! London, with its real misery, its
real starvation, its back slums, and foetid lodg-
ing-houses, its skeleton children playing by
filthy sewers, or learning their apprenticeship
to prison of experter thieves—its over-laboured
needlewomen, its gaunt and pallid men “out
of work”—its vice, its woe, and its wretched-
ness: its great bridges, spanning the fog-
haunted river on whose disturbed and befouled
waters tiny black steamers shoot hither and
thither like insects of the beetle tribe; and where
the cry of the drowning suicide is lost in the hum
of gathered multitudes restlessly pursuing the
pleasures or the business of life.
London, too, in its cheerier aspect: its handsome
thriving shops, displaying so much of colour and
light in their crystal frontages, that the dazzled eye
feels as though it had been looking through a ka-
leidoscope; its parks and squares, where liveried
equipages whirlwith such wondrous speed that their
painted wheels seem made of lines of coloured
light: its theatres, shows, operas, and picture
exhibitions; its restless effort to amuse itself all

and to make the worst of the night. London,
with its clubs like Italian palaces; its Houses of
Lords and Commons like German churches; its
public offices for Ministers of State, like very
shabby paper manufactories; its Horseguards, with
the huge mounted figures playing at sentries before
the gates; its Whitehall, where a king's head fell

same ground where once miserable lepers crawled
and suffered, ladies now sweep their trains in hurried
curtseys, going to court in feathers and diamonds.
London, with its Buckingham Palace, whose
mean un-regal architecture makes us sigh with
envy, remembering the glorious frontage of the
Tuileries and the Louvre, which in Paris asserts
that claim to royalty which makes it “every inch
a palace,” as Lear was every inch a king. Lon-

In the very heart of this “ tumultuous and
populous city” had Beatrice Brooke been residing
for two months: the months of April and June.
She arrived, blooming with health, bright with
joy, in an ecstasy of eagerness and curiosity:
health, which no degree of fatigue seemed capable
of affecting; curiosity, which no variety of sight-
seeing, or pleasure-seeking, appeared to satiate
or allay. Since then, matters had taken another
turn, and life was beginning to show itself in a
different aspect.
In the first place (for what other feature of her
position could compare in importance with that?)
she did not see as much of Montagu Treherne as
she expected. Very different, indeed, from their
companionship at Tenby was their communion in
London. He spent the Easter in one gay country-
house, and the Whitsuntide at another; he was
constantly engaged to dinners, to balls, to parties;
he attended the debates in the House of Com-
mons; he was fond of play, and a great frequenter
of the Clubs.
And Milly Nesdale was in town |
The importance of which fact was not known
to Beatrice for many a day afterwards, but it

nevertheless, influenced her present destiny. It
is not so easy to get rid of your old love, in
a society where the same people meet every
day, belong to “the same set,” and when your
promotion in your profession and your parlia-
mentary success may be damaged by weakening
such ties.
Montagu Treherne had, indeed, no desireto break
them. True, he was in love with Beatrice Brooke;
but he had still nearly three years to wait before
he could marry without consent of his guardians,
or obtain an increased allowance to marry upon;
and as to marrying “upon nothing,” Montagu
was not the sort of man to contemplate that pos-
sibility. One of Milly's uncles (or rather Lord
Nesdale's uncle, for Milly herself was not highly con-
nected) had great political influence, and Montagu
was in the profession of diplomacy; another
uncle was all powerful in the Yorkshire borough
which the young M.P. represented. It must be
admitted, too, that although Treherne was, as we
have said, “in love” with Beatrice,—though he
passionately admired her beauty, was amused with
her conversation, and the echo of her rich voice,
when she sang, seemed to thrill his whole

being,-yet he experienced in a degree, on
her arrival in town, that strange desillusionme-
ment peculiar to worldly persons, when the habits
and tastes of those who are not “accustomed to
the world” jar with theirs.
Not all Beatrice Brooke's beauty could blind
him to the fact that, somehow or other, her dresses
were neither the right width or length, nor even
of the right material. He was positively annoyed,
one day, at the thickness of her neat little boots,
when walking in Kensington Gardens with the
Wollingham girls. His eye rested on them per-
petually. The existence of those boots gave a
certain acrid turn to his conversation.
He thought her rage for sight-seeing positively
childish and absurd. Still worse was her fondness
for the theatres. Not all the glory of her soft
glad eyes could diminish his discontent when she
said to him, “We are going to the play again to-
night—will you come P” Once, indeed, he re-
belled utterly-instead of coming sauntering in
towards the close of the entertainments, as he
generally did. He had undertaken, at her request,
to remind Lady Eudocia of a promise to get the
Queen's box some night “when nobody else could

go”—some ball night. He asked late, and the
box was already given; a fact he notified to
Beatrice by letter. What was his amazement when
going to call late in the day, he was informed by
Beatrice, with one of her most radiant smiles, that
they were “going to the play all the same.”
“Going?”
“Yes; papa said if I was very much disap-
pointed we might send and take places, and we
did so. There is a ticket for you; we took five.”
Treherne looked at Beatrice; he looked at the
tickets. He gave a sort of discontented laugh, as
he imaged himself escorting to the public boxes a
party of ladies; and, finally, he said bluntly,
“You really can't do these sort of things.”
“What can’t We do?”
“You can’t go to the public boxes.”
“But why?”
“Why—why? Because nobody does. You
must be patient,” added he, with a more good-
humoured smile, as he looked in her face, “and
wait till you can get a box lent you. I wish I
could always “lay one at your feet, as the French
call it; though it would be a sad encouragement
of your taste for playgoing. And if you really

are so disappointed, I will go to Mitchell's and
get these exchanged, and a box taken.”
He did so. He came for half an hour during
the performance, and then he went to the great
ball of the evening; and Beatrice went home
tired, and rather sad, she scarce knew why; but
she felt that she and Treherne were somehow
living in separate worlds.
Three balls had fallen to her share. One, Maurice -
Lewellyn provided. He wrote a kind note from
his chambers in the Temple, saying that he did
not go to balls himself, as he was working hard a
the study of the law; but he hoped Mariana and
Beatrice would go, the lady who gave it being an
old friend of his mother's. One they were asked
too, naturally, by a friend of Captain Brooke; and
it was a pretty ball, in a handsome house, with a
great deal of dancing and an excellent supper, but
all blighted by the fact that Treherne was not
there, as they were not in “that set” whose balls
he frequented. And one ball Treherne himself
had brought to pass—after about twenty battling
notes and conversations, winding up with a threat
on his part to stay away altogether if the Brookes
were not asked.


## p. 73 (#89) ##############################################

That entertainment was indeed important, for
it was the Soirée Dansante of the Marchioness of
Updown!
The great grandiose card was brought, with
“Captain Brooke and one Miss Brooke” written
on it, which Treherne eagerly assured them was
the usual, indeed the inevitable arrangement at
all balls, to prevent a redundancy of young ladies.
The brief consultation was held with Mariana as
to a fitting toilette. And Beatrice made her first
appearance in the world of fashion.
THE MARCHIONESS “received,” in rooms so glo-
riouslylighted, that Beatrice scarcely saw her stand
glittering under the chandelier; spread, and per-
fumed, and gorgeously coloured, like an immense
bouquet on the altar of a Roman Catholic shrine.
She made her pleased curtsey, poor child,
in utter unconsciousness that the fat woman
meant to be rude; though the Marchioness,
(who had promised to ask her, to please
Treherne, but had not promised to be civil)
received simple Captain Brooke and his daughter
with the stern stiffness of a French sergeant
of police who is giving a “permission de cir-

movement of the head, which did duty for a bow,
and a sort of wave with her spangled fan at
Treherne, as much as to say, “There are those
people you desired me to invite; take them on,
out of the way,”—being all the notice given them
during the evening by the lady of the house.
But simple Captain Brooke dreamt of no dis-
courtesy; and indeed was very comfortable, for
he met one or two old Waterloo officers, whom he .
had formerly known, and who were glad to chat
with him; and as to Beatrice, her pleasure knew
no bounds. She danced with Trehernea quadrille,
and a valse, and the cotillon; she danced with
several other gentlemen whom Treherne and Helen
Wollingham presented, and whose names she was
too fluttered to hear, and never cared to remember;
and once her father presented a gentleman to
her; “General Pryce Perry, my dear.” She re-
membered that name, partly because she thought
it an odd one, and partly because, though he had
but one arm, and was quite an old man, she
thought she had never seen anyone so handsome
or distinguished looking.
She watched with fond interest lovely Helen
Wollingham flying through the waltz, dressed

entirely in white, with apple blossoms in her hair;
and then she went into the room adjoining the
ball-room with her father, and gazed on the beauti-
ful Corregios, and Raphaels, and Canalettis, and
Titians, which formed part of the wealth of the
owners of the splendid house: and Treherne came
and joined her there, and said rather uneasily
though fondly,– “You must come and look at all
these things some morning; they are better seen
by daylight.” For he considered there was some-
thing bizarre and unusual in Beatrice walking
about as if she was at an exhibition; and in fine
society no one ever looks at anything but the
people who form the evening crowd.
Beyond this little flaw, however, in her conduct,
he had no fault to find with Beatrice this evening.
Her dress was perfect; she and Helen Wollingham
had chosen it together — and if the rich coral
circlet round her hair, the massy coral chain round
her throat, and the heavy coral bracelets, seemed a
little too matronly as ornaments (they had indeed
been her mother's), they suited well with her Italian
style of beauty, and did not “jar,” even in Tre-
herne's opinion, with the simplicity of her white
dress.

76 LOST AND SAVED.
A new face in the circle of London fashionables
who meet every night at one house or another, is
soon discerned; and Beatrice was much noticed
and admired. “Who is that beautiful girl?” “I
don’t know; oh, a Miss Burke, or Brooke, or
Broome, or something, a sort of cousin of the
Wollinghams, I believe.” This question and
answer were often repeated in the course of the
evening; and as she walked into the supper-room,
leaning on Treherne's arm, he felt proud and
contented, for when those already seated looked up
at them, the whispers of admiration were again
very audible.
As Treherne handed her into the carriage, she
said—
“I am so glad to have seen Helen Wollingham
in her ball dress. How beautiful, how very, very
beautiful she looked !”
“If you could but know how beautiful you
yourself looked, Beatrice,” said Treherne. “Give
me the red rose you wore—the ‘rose of June’—
I will keep it till I die.”
Very passionately the young man spoke, and
quick grew the pulse of the young girl's heart as

she took the rose from the corsage of her dress.
She had her glove on,— but through the glove she
felt, to her heart's core, the light hurried kiss
which thanked the ready little hand; and soft on
the breath of that June night already breaking
into morning, came the waft of his perfumed
hair, as the carriage door closed and they drove
rapidly home.
General Pryce Perry stood on the steps at the
entrance waiting till Lady Eudocia's carriage
should be announced.
“I am doing duty for you, my dear boy, with
your cousins,” said the old soldier with rather a
vexed smile.
“Is she not beautiful?” was all the answer
made.
“Not so beautiful as Helen Wollingham.”
“Yes, more beautifull more lovely than Helen
of Troy! and I shall go home and dream of her,”
said Montagu, gaily; “so good night!”
What happy dreams' Beatrice dreamed that
she was already Treherne's wife, and was herself
giving a great ball on the occasion of Helen
Wollingham's marriage with a Venetian Doge,

but his own necessary to preface his union with
the sweet giver of that rose of June.

SISTERLY SISTERS.
To think that so pleasant an evening should be
the root, cause, and up-bringer of a remarkably
disagreeable morning! But so it was.
Early next day — early, considering how late
they had all been up at the ball, and how late
their habitual hours were,—Lady Eudocia Wolling-
ham arrived at The Marchioness's door, and walked
straight up to The Marchioness's dressing-room.
She did this though she knew it was intolerable
to her sister. She was too angry to think of
what was intolerable, except to herself.
The Marchioness was still resting her luxuriant
and luxurious form among the well-filled downy
cushions of her large purple state-bed, when she
was informed of this irruption into her domains.
Great was the ire that rose in her mind, and

sparkled in her eye; and so loud the tones of her
voice, that the equally angry visitor heard the
bedroom colloquy with the maid.
“Your ladyship's sister, – Lady Eudocia
wished —”
“I don't care what she wished. I forbid you
to let any one enter my dressing-room, sister or no
sister. I like Eudocia's insolence ! I don’t care
if it was an angel from heaven, if I choose them
not to be let in, you're not to let them in.”
“Certainly not, my lady,” said the alarmed
abigail; “I wouldn't on any account. Shall I

And ceasing to guard against the angelic visit-
ants, the barring of whose highly improbable
entrance was to exemplify her power, the Mar-
chioness clothed, or semi-clothed, her corpulent
form in a richly-worked and profusely-flounced
white muslin negligée,—and hurriedly traversing
her stately bedroom, entered the dressing-room

causeuse with all her white flounces floating and
subsiding with her, looking altogether like an
incensed large white owl come to confront an angry
falcon; a bird the more slender dowager very
much resembled.
The two sisters clashed their hard handsome
eyes at each other, but did not immediately
speak; for Lady Eudocia was considering what
to say, and the Marchioness was conscious
of being out of breath with her rapid en-
trance and was also preoccupied with that
vision of Eudocia “poking among her things,”
which she had so elegantly hinted at to her
maid.
O Primavera, Gioventù dell' anno!

O Gioventul—it is the subject of more regrets

How they do this is supposed to be a secret. By
burning sulphur under a garden rose, you can turn
it to a sallow white; and a young Jewess, who last
year complained in a police court of the seizure
of her stock of cosmetics, amazed the magistrate
by declaring she could restore bloom to the most
faded cheek by the application of “drab powder.”
The chemist's shop is the storehouse of the
modern Medea; and we know that part of the
success in these cases depends on the privacy of
method. For when the real Medea undertook to re-
store youth to Jason's tottering old father,—and on
the principle of “ce n'est que le premier pas qui

in a barrel,—we learn that the failure of the expe-
riment arose from no want of skill on her part, but
from the too impatient curiosity which prompted
some doubter to disturb the process; “whereupon
there came out only the form of a little child,
which fled and disappeared,” instead of a stately
man in the prime of life!
Now, of this principle of secrecy, the Mar-
chioness was a staunch upholder. She was not

“fraicheur,” and she was proud of it, and
cherished it, and preserved it; how,— the angels
whose possible intrusion she so protested against,
might know, but we never shall; nor did
she choose that even her sister should; and she
now sent a suspicious glance to the cumbered
toilette-table, with all its manifold treasures of
crystal, and gold, and china. Lady Eudocia's eye
followed the glance, and understood it. “Oh !”
she said, contemptuously, “you needn’t be afraid.
I haven’t been interfering with your pots and
pigments; I’ve too much real anxiety, I can tell
you, for such a waste of time.”
“Your real anxieties don’t seem to have pre-
vented your attending to your own toilette this
morning,” said the Marchioness, with a sneering
and emphasised glance at the roseate bloom on her
sister's cheeks.
“They have at least brought me out earlier in
the day than you seem able to get out of bed; which
habit of yours is what makes you the size you are.”

With a snap of the fat white fingers covered
with turquoise and diamond rings, and a flouncing
shake to all the embroidered frilling of the owlish
feathery dressing-gown, the thoroughly exasperated
marchioness rose, and giving a passionate and
prolonged tingle to the blue Sévres hand-bell

snorting command to her maid to “let Lady
Eudocia's carriage be called,” she flapped into
the purple bedroom again, and slammed the door

was ended.

have done better to have spoken more gently;
perhaps not ; for people who have no habitual
self-government, have very little of what the
French call a “retour sur eux-mêmes,” and
gentle or cross, she had the deepest (and truest)
conviction that it was a matter of indifference to
the prosperous, childless, self-centred marchioness,
what became of any one member of her family,
or any individual of her acquaintance, so long
as she, the Marchioness of Updown, ate her good
dinner off her gold and silver plate, slept un-
molested in her purple silk bed, and drove out
untroubled in her brilliantly liveried carriage.
The marchioness, on the other hand, who felt
in her conscience (if she had a conscience), that
she had never given a thought to Treherne's
reason for wishing Captain Brooke asked – not
even when she saw the handsome girl who merely
realised to her the condescending words, “ONE

difference to everybody's happiness could not
have been transformed to interest, if she had
been ever so much desired as an ally of her
nephew, — was as outraged, as all such martyrs

are, at her sister's injustice. She had a headache,
too, after that angry colloquy, and the sudden
getting out of bed: a headache, which even the
camphor and salvolatile administered by the
trembling Abigail would not take away.
The idea of her having a headache, because
Eudocia had the insolence to come and scold her
in her own dressing-room about things she never
thought of! It was enough to make a breach
between them for life. And as to Helen Wolling-
ham,-though she, poor beautiful child, had done
nothing to offend anyone,—fierce were the secret
determinations of the Marchioness never to invite
her, or help her to any of the little radiant
pleasures of girlhood again.
Almost she had resolved to do, what she had
not the least intended till after that stormy inter-
view,-really to take Beatrice into notice, and
invite her, and prómer her; but this was pre-
vented by untoward circumstances which, the
night of that very ball, were gathering to crush
Captain Brooke, though he knew it not.

LADY EUDOCIA had not begun by being rude or
unkind to Beatrice in London. On the contrary,
her beautiful voice agreeing well with Helen
Wollingham's in all their duets, and her gentle
sprightly amusing talk, having a visible effect on
the spirits of the delicate affectionate girl whose
health had given so much anxiety, she bent her
mind to Sir Bertie Lewellyn's advice to “let the
two young friends be a little together.” To his
advice, as a sort of curative process, rather even
than as a yielding to her daughter's playfully-
worded but earnestly urged petitions.

the house. I am quite sure I change colour, and
become a dull grey, like a chameleon taken off the
green grass and put down upon brown gravel.”
So Helen Wollingham was allowed sometimes
to call for Beatrice in the open carriage; and they
walked together, and sang together, and lunched
together; and three or four times Lady Eudocia
had even taken them together to the opera, when
they were learning of Marras duets which they
could there hear sung in the greatest perfection.
Those operas! Alas! it was one of those very
evenings at the opera that did all the mischief.
Of all the pleasures so eagerly enjoyed by the all-
enjoying spirit that lived in Beatrice Brooke, this
going to the opera was the greatest. It was her
chief delight; and she was to pay for it, as we
often have to do for our chief delights, with
bitter pain.
They were sitting in Lady Eudocia's roomy and
comfortable box; the opera was the “Sonnambula,”
and the divertissement was being danced. An
elderly Miss Wollingham, niece to Lady Eudocia's
husband, had her glass to her eyes.
“There is that dancer that Montagu used to
admire so much,” said she.

“Where?” said Beatrice wonderingly.
“There, with fair hair, lifting the garland over
her head—close to the footlights.”
“And did she fall in love with him ?” asked
Beatrice, fixing her eyes on the dancer.
The elderly girl laughed.
“I really don’t know,” she said. “I suppose,
like most of those young ladies, she cared less
about him than about the gewgaws he gave
her.”
“But I wonder she cared for his presents if
she did not care about him,” said Beatrice, with
the gravest simplicity.
“Well, there sits his present admiration, which
is a step towards better taste,” rejoined Miss Wol-
lingham. This time Beatrice turned quite round
to her companion.
“Who do you mean?” she said.
“Lady Nesdale–Milly Nesdale — there — no,
not quite opposite, but in that box in the bend of
the house, – very prettily dressed, with a strange
and pretty wreath; don’t you see her? She is
talking very eagerly to some gentlemen — to the
French ambassador and some other foreigner.”
“My dear Catherine, I have repeatedly told

you that all these gossipings are in the worst
possible taste,” said Lady Eudocia severely,
“and I do not desire my girls to hear them.”
The morality of the remarks was not in Lady
Eudocia's mind: only the “bad taste,” and the
possible prejudice against Montagu in Helen's
mind, whom she perpetually represented to herself
as the future Countess of Caërlaverock. The
speaker was silenced, and a good deal affronted,
which she showed by putting up her lip with a
sneer. But Lady Eudocia did not observe her.
A gleam of intelligence, as to something else,
occupied that acute mind.
She was watching Beatrice.
As she sat in the shade at the back of the
opera box, she scrutinized—in the full glare of
light—the beautiful changeful face, that needed
not those cold glittering eyes which for fifty
years had looked on the glittering world of
fashion, to read its thoughts,—but could be read
by a child. She saw the restless glances pursuing
that one dancer through all the mazes of the dance;
the anxious absent expression during the singing
of music that had lately been listened to with such
eagerness; the sorrowful tremble of Beatrice's lip

and the moisture of unshed tears in her eyes, when
the “Son geloso’’ was heard,—plaintive and per-
fect both in words and music; and finally she saw
the start when, having entered the box unheard,
Montagu Treherne spoke to Beatrice, and the look
of shy imploring love with which she turned
towards him, as though appealing to him against
the unknown accusation made in his absence.
Lady Eudocia perceived that from that moment
it was not the opera that occupied Beatrice, but
Treherne. She heard the impatient sighs that
came from that innocent heart, when his eyes were
directed either to the stage or to Lady Nesdale.
She saw that when he went to pay his visit to
that other box Beatrice grew positively pale,—
and twice she said to her—
“I fear, my dear, you are not well to-night, or
you are tired, would you like to go?”—- before,
with a rush of crimson to her cheek, Beatrice heard
and answered—answered with more even than her
usual eagerness—
“Oh no, do not let us go! I am not tired; I
was thinking. Pray do not go.”
Finally the wily chaperone saw the unquiet eyes
come back to radiant peace, — when, from Milly

Nesdale's box, crowded as it was with diplomats
and adorers, Montagu Treherne returned to theirs,
and gave his arm to Beatrice down the corridor and
through the round room, leaving his cousin Helen
to the handsome attaché of the Austrian embassy,
and the other two ladies to the chance courtesy of
mutual acquaintance.
Lady Eudocia never took Beatrice to the opera
again.

CHAPTER X.
AMONG THE QUICKSANDS.
THE morning after the ball, which had produced
so stormy an interview between the inimical
sisters, Beatrice went early to her friend Helen
Wollingham. She had walked from the lodgings
in Spring Gardens to their house in Grosvenor
Square. As she untied the strings of her bonnet,
Helen could not help saying with a sigh, “How I
envy you your health, Beatricel I feel ready to
die with the fatigue of last night, though I danced
very few dances, and have only this moment
breakfasted. As to dressing, I put it off till I
dress for dinner. And here are you as bright as a
sunbeam, not the least tired, though you have
walked here.”
“Oh, not the least tired !” said Beatrice, in
the clear glad tone which tells so much of an

inward spring of happiness. She was in that con-
dition of mind described by Emile Souvestre, in
which he says of the heroine of his “Riche et
Pauvre.” “Comme elle se leva fraiche et reposée
de cette nuit sans sommeil!” Joy was in every
fibre of her frame, like the sap of life in a tree in
spring.
“Well, at least you have nothing to do but
to rest,” resumed she, as she sat down by Helen's
sofa; “which is more than can be said for Mariana.
and me — only my dear Mariana does all my
household tasks for me. We have but one
servant besides the lodging-house maid. Now
contrast that with your way of living !” And she
laughed merrily. Helen sighed.
“Do you know, Beatrice, this luxury, which
you admire, is not valued by me, as perhaps in
thankfulness it ought to be. I do not mean that
I should like a busy painstaking life; I am not
fit for it: but I should like a quiet life, a life with
companions, and not with mere “society.’”
“Well, let me be one of the companions !”
said Beatrice gaily; “But indeed your luxury is
beyond what is usual. Now, only count your Ser-
vants! I sometimes wonder what work they can

possibly find to divide among them. Count them.
There is, to begin, the hall porter, whose business
is, I believe, to shut me out, for he was a most
reluctant Cerberus to-day.”
“Well, that is better than the Marchioness of
Updown's porter. Count Freiligrath called on her
the other day; and being a stranger and a foreigner,
I suppose Cerberus thought he must be some one
with a petition; and the Marchioness is like the
‘young courtier’ in the old ballad, who “relieved
the poor with a thump on the back with a stone.’
So the porter scrutinised the visitor from head
to foot; took out his list of who were to be ad-
mitted; read it through, half aloud; and not
finding the name of Freiligrath set down in that
sacred band, folded it and said, ‘No, sir; the
Marchioness is NOT at home.’”
“So much for the hall porter's duty. Then

“And a butler, and his under-butlers and his

white fingers.

our Plate. I should say our Plate and us,—for I
am quite sure all my “golden hair, which you are
so fond of praising, is not to be compared in the
mind of our good old Jarvis with the value of the

things on at his sideboard, which was made in
graduated steps like an altar. Then we hear of
the Duke d'Alba, who didn’t consider himself rich,
but nevertheless had six hundred dozen silver
plates and eight hundred dishes. It is true M.
d’Aulnois laughs a little at these ‘Grands d’Es-
pagne’ (who after all were neither hospitable nor
comfortable), for she says, slily, “So many silver
dishes were unnecessary, only to set on table two
eggs and a roast pigeon l’”
“Ah, Helen l but you are hospitable and
comfortable,” said Beatrice with rather a repining
sigh, as she looked round the fresh and beautiful
room, which certainly in its arrangement did all
credit to the groom of the chambers; “and you
have a hundred more slaves of the lamp in this
Aladdin's palace.”
“Not a hundred, but a great number certainly,”
said Helen thoughtfully. “It is—it must be—to
you, dear Beatrice, with your paucity of attend-
ance, a most curious reflection, the quantity of
persons whose sole occupation is to minister to
the wants and amusements of one family.”

“No, that goes on in all trades, and all over the
world, Helen; but the comfort of luxury is what
strikesme. The three ladies' maids all plaiting and
sleeking that hair (I beg pardon for praising it)—
yours and your pretty sisters—and the footmen
who seem only to go about gaily dressed, jumping
down to knock at doors, and open carriages—and
the train of tidy housemaids and kitchenmaids, and
grooms and coachmen, and the joy and delight of
having only to ring the bell such a day as this
and order the open carriage.”
They were still chatting merrily when Lady
Eudocia entered her daughter's room, fresh from
the battle with the Marchioness. She looked at
Beatrice with ill-concealed irritation.
“I do not think it is good for Helen to see
people to-day,” she said; “she is not strong
enough: she should keep quiet after the ball. The
carriage can take you home, Miss Brooke, before
it puts up. Good-bye.”
Beatrice saw the displeasure; she reproached
herself; she attributed the coldness of Lady Eudo-
cia's manner to real anxiety about Helen's health;
and thought how selfish she had been in coming.
Poor Beatrice!

She was set down at the door of Spring Gar-
dens. As she entered, the very face of the servant
and of the landlady, who peeped out of the par-
lour at the sound of the wild and imperious
double knock given by one of the two tall foot-
men of the Wollingham family coach, told her
that something unusual had occurred. For an
instant she paused; she had almost given way to
the impulse which prompted her to ask, “What
is the matter?” of the landlady,–who curtseyed,
and drew back into the parlour.
Beatrice flew up stairs into the little drawing-

found bending over some book or delicate embroi-
dery, pale and placid. Mariana was not seated at
her book or work; she was standing in the centre
of the small room looking towards the door, and
expecting Beatrice, whose return she had heard.

flood of tears. Mariana !

of reckless men who brought them to this ruin!
He was gone to prison, that gallant old officer,
for other men's misdeeds, and his own imprudence.

the Temple every morning, hurrying through
the crowded Strand, hoping that by dint of
lawyers, “Matters would be set to rights.”

Even to patient watchful Mariana he had said
nothing; once only he had alluded to the situation

that he had taken it to be within easy distance of
“business” in the Strand; and once, with a sigh,
he had recommended rigid economy in their little
household, adding with an anxious smile, “We
never were very rich, and we may be very poor
before long.” That was all; yet Mariana had
foreseen enough to break the blow when it came.
Beatrice had foreseen nothing.

bitter also to Mariana; and bitter the days that

For many days, for more than a fortnight,
in spite of what had passed between them,
Beatrice did not see Montagu Treherne. The
“esclandre” of Captain Brooke's position, and the
breaking up of the bubble company in which he
was a director, was news that flew with the wild-
fire rapidity usual in London. Lady Eudocia
took that opportunity to forbid her girls ever to
see more of the Brookes—“a parcel of adventurers
and adventuresses.” Lady Diana Lewellyn, who
would have been more generous, was at the Hague
with her husband. The Marchioness, having quar-
relled with her sister about Beatrice, now quar-
relled with Treherne for having created the
possibility of people marking who Captain Brooke
was, by saying, “Oh, yes, you know, father of
that extraordinarily handsome girl who came
out at Lady Updown's last ball.” She and

a week's run over to Paris; partly on some racing

eyes; and their wearied wistful look haunted
Treherne incessantly as he walked to and from his
club; sat restlessly through unheard debates in
the Commons; dined at brilliantly lighted tables
on engagements of a month's standing; or drove
to the sunny “breakfasts” given at Richmond or
Wimbledon.
That girl! that Rose of June, fading in her
hot little lodging—he could not forget her.

CHAPTER XI.
SUMMER FRIENDS.
BEATRICE was indeed very miserable, and begin-
ning to feel very ill. A lodging in Spring Gardens
sounds airy enough; but when that lodging is on
the Charing Cross side of Spring Gardens, and
the tiny hot room looks up the Strand across the
whirl of carriages and the inmate seldom gets
out, it is very trying.
Beatrice was “country bred.” Even in her
joyful phase, she had felt the confinement of
London. With all her daily pleasures and walks,
and occasional drives with the Wollinghams, it
had somewhat fevered and oppressed her. Now
she felt stifled. The July days, with their op-
pressive city odours,—the vainly open window that
only brought in dust, and the reeking of hot har-
ness, and the smell of bruised fruit, with the

shrill cries of those who sold it,—the cease-
less sound of passing feet, and whirling wheels,—
all this made her sick. She could not eat; she
could not sleep; her passionate fanciful nature, so
dependent on external things for pleasure, re-
volted as if she had been suddenly shut up in
prison.
And then she thought of her father, and wept;
and her heart ached and burned, as only young
hearts can burn, with vain indignation against
those who had so cheated him: with helpless
wrath against the injustice of those who dared
to blame him. The newspapers were rife with
comments on the bubble scheme. All was com-
fortless |
At first Beatrice did not “realise” her position
with the Wollinghams. On one of the first of those
sultry July afternoons, she rose from her desk,
put on her bonnet, and resolved to walk to
Grosvenor Square.
She felt restless and anxious; she thought
perhaps Helen was ill, or the family unwilling
to disturb Mariana and herself in their first
trouble; they were scarcely intimate enough for
sympathy. She longed to see Helen; to see

all those beautiful golden-haired girls, so elegant,
so perfectly dressed, and so courteous. She
longed to sit in that great, fresh, shaded, cool
drawing-room; redolent of flowers and moss
from the well-filled gilt latticed-baskets in all
the windows. To sit there, if only for half an
hour, instead of sitting in that sultry little room
at Charing Cross.
There was no one to accompany her; they had
no servant now. She walked alone. The porter
said the ladies were “at home,” but as the foot-
man who ushered her up stairs pronounced her
name, Beatrice heard Lady Eudocia repeat in a
tone of the severest astonishment, “Miss Brooke!”
and “Oh! hush, dear mamma,” from Helen, as
if to seal the significance of the exclamation.
She felt embarrassed and confused; already
flushed and wearied with her walk, nothing but a
proud courage prevented her bursting into tears.
The visit was silent and constrained; no one
proposed, as formerly, that she should take off
her bonnet and sing some duets: no one, except
Helen, volunteered to talk. The “waiting for her
to go” was only too evident!
She rose, after a brief stay, to take leave;

and then for the first time Lady Eudocia (who
had been sedulously reading the “Morning
Post”) addressed her.
“How did you come here? I mean, who with ?”
“I came alone: I walked here by myself.”
“You walked alone! Well, I do really think!
Sara! ring the bell.” -
A dead pause ensued: Beatrice did not look
up, till she heard Helen sigh,-and then her lifted
eyes met Helen's sorrowfully fixed on her for a
moment, and tearfully withdrawn.
The footman answered the bell. “Desire John
to see Miss Brooke home; and do recollect that
you are to admit No ONE, without first bringing
me up the cards.”
Scarcely rested in body, -outraged in mind,—
and feeling as if she were being marched home
in custody, with the tall footman behind her,—
Beatrice reached her hot lodgings again. She
strove to bear her depression, and occupy herself.
She thought of Mariana's noble, calm, and en-
during patience: but natures are different; and
Beatrice broke down and wept.
She had a little comfort in the evening, for
Maurice Lewellyn called, and spoke kindly and

cheeringly to her. He did not stay long; he
could not; but before he went, he showed her a
note from Helen Wollingham to himself: it said,
“Now that your mother, my good aunt Dumpty,
is at the Hague, and our town life so restless—
. I do not see much of the very people I wish to
see most of I am very anxious about Beatrice
Brooke; will you spare time now and then to tell
me about her? I send her a nosegay by you.”
The longest explanation could not have told
Beatrice more plainly than these few simple
lines—that she was to see no more of the
Wollinghams, but that Helen would love and
remember her! She kissed the great white roses
in the nosegay Helen sent. They reminded her
of home, and of joyous days.
It was impossible for Treherne to be ignorant
of this state of things. Easy was it to cross-
examine poor Beatrice; he was welcome to every
thought of her heart; and not difficult to cross-
examine Helen Wollingham, who, though she
forbore venturing even implied blame of her
mother, thought that all could be said to help
sympathy from other friends, was fair.
From other friends? Well—from Treherne.

If Helen Wollingham did guess that Beatrice
and Treherne liked each other; that Beatrice
had a warm loving heart, and Treherne a selfish
one; she only guessed what was true.
Montagu's anger against his aunts increased
tenfold; and when day by day Beatrice became
paler and more languid, he openly expressed his
opinion of their unkindness.
If ever there was a time when a few invitations
to be with Eudocia's girls — a few drives in the
open carriage—a few little offerings of grapes and
other fruits — a few of the small courtesies which
would have cost them nothing, would have been
grateful and pleasant, it was now, in this detest-
able July weather.
And Lady Eudocia answered, with one of her
fierce glittering smiles, that she would have been
most happy to have improved her acquaintance
with the Brookes, had the daughter seemed more
discreet, and the father under no awkward impu-
tation as to honesty; but that she could not approve
of young ladies who strolled all over London
without any chaperon, or of men who mixed them-
selves in speculations which brought them within
the power of the law.

She could not cultivate such acquaintances,
for the sake of her girls. She was obliged to be
particular; more particular than the Marchioness.
But of course Treherne could continue to visit
them. Gentlemen could visit anywhere. Ladies
could not.
It is an old proverb that “you may strain
a cord till it break:” and Treherne, who had
readily winced under sneers not one tithe as
bitter, and been tormented by little unworldly-
fisms in Beatrice's dress and ways when she first
came to town, felt his whole soul stung
with rebellious exasperation at this speech. He
was as wilful as the rest of his family, and every
day more “in love” with Beatrice. He there-
fore came to a sudden resolution, even while
pausing in his aunt's drawing-room, smoothing
the nap of his hat, as he rose to go away.
Something of her own mocking smile was in
his handsome young face, as he said, “Very
well; I must see if I can find friends who are
more obliging,” and so departed.

CHAPTER XII.
FRIENDS WHO EXPECT THE QUID PRO QUO.
THE well-appointed cab in which Treherne left
his aunt's door, took a rapid whirling course to a
less fashionable locality, and stopped at a hand-
some house in Russell Square, belonging to a
gentleman of the name of Grey, the solicitor to
Treherne's family. Law business, however, did
not appear to be the young lover's object; for he
desired the groom to ask “if Mrs. Myra Grey
was at home,” and, receiving an answer in the
affirmative, jumped lightly out of the cab, and
very nimbly ascended the stairs which led to that
lady's drawing-room.
“I am come to ask a favour,” he said, before
the servant had shut the door; and the counte-
nance of the lady certainly did not threaten any

refusal, whatever the favour might be. Indeed,
before the expiration of his brief visit (which
lasted less than a quarter of an hour), Treherne
took both the lady's hands in his own with grace-
ful and cordial thanks, and told her with one of
his most winning smiles, that if all that remained
to do was that she should “get Mr. Grey's
consent on his return home,” he looked on the
business as settled.
So did Mrs. Myra Grey: and she lifted her
dark languid eyes with an answering smile, as
though admitting the implied compliment to her
power, and shook hands again with her young
visitor as she accompanied him to the drawing-
room door.
Very dark, very languid eyes they were; and
set, those dark jewels, in what had been a very
beautiful face; in spite of the unmistakable trace
of Indian blood, for Mrs. Myra Grey was the
daughter of one of our Indian magistrates, and her
mother was a Hindoo. Nor was her history alto-
gether uninteresting to Treherne's family. Mar-
ried at a very early age to the Collector of
Customs at Burrumpootra, she attracted the

notice of the Governor of the Presidency, the
Honourable Pierrepoint Treherne, the very same
who was now Earl of Caërlaverock ; and his
notice of her attracted the notice of all who had
an opportunity of witnessing it. She was not
ashamed of that notice; she was proud of it.
She boasted, in her pretty way, that she made
the governor do kindnesses to her “good old .
man,” as she called her husband; and she spoke
of herself as a “foolish child.” She took bribes
from the native litigants under pretence of influ-
encing decisions. Her good old man's health
failed in the very zenith of his favour at Govern-
ment house. He could not tell what ailed him;
he had been a fine robust man, though no longer
in the prime of life. His whole constitution
seemed shaken; his eyes grew very weak; his
digestion failed; a perpetual tremor tormented
him. It was settled he should go into the hill
country for a short time, to recruit.
Sir Bertie Lewellyn, then a very young man,
beginning medical life as resident doctor at Go-
vernment House, came to see the Collector before
he went. He wished him to take some relative
or friend with him besides his “inexperienced

wife.” He pressed this point very much — quite
obstinately; and, while he did so, the watchful
eyes of the Hindoo, who never left her husband
alone during the interview, glanced at him with a
sinister augury.
She was sitting by the couch on which the sick
man was reclining, doing nothing—looking at her
bracelets; and, while the Doctor spoke, she laid
her little dark hand with caressing playfulness on
the invalid's damp bleached forehead.
“You think I cannot nurse my old man, you
unwise Doctor?" she said. “I nurse him better
than your big English nurses. I step more softly
to his bedside.”
And her old man, fondly lifting the little hand
from his brow, said, with a faint laugh—
“My dear sir, I’d rather be poisoned by a
mistake of this little hand than nursed by any
other.”
Then those Hindoo eyes and Lewellyn's met for
a moment, — and it was without surprise, though
With a painful conscious feeling, that Sir Bertie
heard soon afterwards that the residence in the
more bracing mountain air had failed to strengthen
the patient.

The Collector was dead, in that out-of-the-way
place; and the “foolish child” came back a
widow.
Lewellyn saw her on her return. She wore
English mourning—widow's weeds—but the cruel
Hindoo eyes wore a look of satisfaction that ill
accorded with that garb of woe; and there
was a look of sleek, quiet, cat-like defiance in
them, while Lewellyn questioned her respecting
the last symptoms of the deceased, which con-
firmed all the evil impressions with which the
doctor's mind had been haunted.
Soon it became whispered in the Presidency
that the English Governor actually thought of
marrying Myra. She had felt too sure of her
power to conceal with any decent care this great
object of her ambition,-the rather as her elder
sister had actually married an English officer of
distinction,-and it grew into a public report. But
in this hope she was baffled. The Governor, on
the contrary, strenuously advised her to go to her
husband's English friends; who, poor souls, had
written letter after letter offering to befriend
“the devoted little creature who had soothed the
last moments of their dear John.”

He added to the pension she would receive as
a widow, three hundred a year from the muni-
ficence of his private purse, “out of regard to
the memory of a most useful public servant.”
He ordered his aide-de-camp to see that the cabin
of the ship in which she took passage was most
comfortably arranged, and he bade her good-bye
in the tenderest manner compatible with the cir-
cumstances of the case, attended as he was during
that touching adieu by several of his staff. He
furnished her with very exigent instructions to the
family solicitor to take the greatest care of her in-
terests and see to the payment of her income: and
then Myra left India,—carrying with her the child
of her sister who had died in the interim, and
whose father thought he could not do better than
avail himself of this opportunity: and carrying also
with her the burning memory of Dr. Lewellyn's
stern contemplative face, as he stood by the Gover-
nor's side to “see her off.”
For there was, between those two, what exists
between many persons, even in our workaday
prosaic life: – the consciousness of unspoken ac-
cusation; the conviction of undetected crime.
Dr. Lewellyn was of opinion that slow poison

had been administered to the Collector of Bur-
rumpootra; and Myra was convinced that he did
think so, and also that it was he who had pre-
vented her marriage with the Honourable Pierre-
point Treherne.
When that gentleman's solicitor saw the
young and beautiful Hindoo widow, he was
greatly struck with her; and after a brief ac-
quaintance proposed for her. Myra was disposed
to be very scornful at first; but finding her
position in England a very obscure and forlorn
one,—that her deceased husband's relations seemed
disappointed in her,—and that no one except
Mr. Grey seemed at all inclined to waste time
visiting her and her little niece, — she thought
better of it and married her new friend.

alluded to in this story. Indeed, the very name
of “Milly” proceeded from this relationship, for
both aunt and niece being christened Myra, it was
necessary to make some distinction; so little
Myra was called “Milly,” and the original Myra,
in an affected and foreign manner, added her own

name to her husband's, and printed her fragile
glazed cards–
Mrs. Myra Grey.
She kept up a certain acquaintance with all the
Treherne family, and to Montagu was apt to
speak of herself with a little affected sigh, as “a
sort of aunt.” She held a different tone with
Mr. Grey, — who received, he scarcely knew how,
the impression that Pierrepoint Treherne (not
generally benevolent) had exercised the most
grand-fatherly tenderness to the helpless and in-
fantile widow, and had received most important
political aid from information given by the de-
ceased Collector.
The gentlemanlike and loyal-hearted solicitor
did not, however, entirely approve of his wife.
He had the instinct that she was at times insin-
cere; and he had a very bad opinion of her niece
Milly Nesdale. But he took life as he found it:
his life was a busy one, and though his profession
did not lead him to indulgence in human charac-
ter, he was disposed to give his beautiful wife the

“benefit of the doubt,” and to suppose, as history
says of Peter the Czar, that “her merits were her
own, and her faults those of her education and
country.”
As to the relations between the two ladies,—
Myra Grey was at once very subservient to Lady
Nesdale, and very jealous of her position in life;
and as to the Treherne family, Myra's great
object was to humour and please Montagu; for
she had not lost the Indian habit of intriguing
for promotion, —and she thought to herself,
“Here is the future Earl of Caërlaverock; the
present Earl is eighty-six; and there is no reason
why Mr. Grey, after being so long the legal adviser
of the family, should not get some excellent lucra-
tive legal appointment; and then I may hold my
own even against Milly Nesdale.”

CHAPTER XIII.
THE EARL OF CAERLAVEROCK.
WHAT the favour was that Treherne had begged of
Mrs. Grey, was communicated to Beatrice before
the hour was out; the next whirl of the elegant
cab being to Spring Gardens, Charing Cross.
Beatrice was alone; she was unoccupied; at
least she was only putting fresh water to the
fading white roses Helen Wollingham had sent
her.
Treherne threw himself into a chair, though
she was still standing, still attending to the roses
after shaking hands with him.
“Beatrice,” said he, eagerly, “I have come to
speak with you. This life is intolerable—to both
of us! My uncle's lawyer, Mr. Grey, is going to
Venice to arrange with him about some mortgages
on the Lincolnshire property, which seem, in

consequence of my grandfather's will, to be a most
difficult and complicated affair. His wife goes
with him; I have just called on her; I have
arranged with her that, if your father consents,
you shall make this little holiday tour on the
Continent. It will do you good; you are sickening
and pining like a caged bird. I shall go too; I
shall go and see my uncle at Venice. You shall see
him. When he sees you; oh! when he sees you,
Beatrice, he will understand that life is nothing
without you! He will listen to me; and I will
get his consent to our immediate marriage. If
my aunt Eudocia could marry Mr. Wollingham,
surely I may hope for consent to marry you; I
have arranged it all with Mrs. Grey. She is
coming to call upon you; to invite you; she will
be most indulgent — most kind.”
He stopped. Beatrice had dropped her white
roses on the table, and set down the jug of water
which was to be their lure still to a little fresh-
ness. She was seated opposite to him — listening
to him — listening and looking at him; but oh!
so deadly pale !
He rose, and poured someofthewaterintoaglass.
“I beg your pardon for my abruptness,” he said;

“I ought perhaps to beg pardon for such certainty
of consent” (and he smiled a feverish eager smile,
answered by a shy smile of fondness from Beatrice),
“but I am so anxious to put an end to this state
of things, so anxious to see you look like yourself
again. All I ask of you is not to breathe a sylla-
ble to any human being of my intentions with
respect to seeing my uncle, or of our marriage.
You might at once prevent the possibility of hap-
piness; you would not be allowed to go, and I—”
“How can I go?” said Beatrice, at last;
“how can you think I would go, and leave
Mariana and my father?”
“Beatrice,” said Treherne, with increased eager-
ness, “I am certain your father would be thankful
to know you away on an excursion with these
people. You are, at this moment, more of a
burden and anxiety to him than you can yourself
imagine. He knows Grey, and all who know
him trust and respect him. There is no fear of
your father's consent, and in a few months matters
will be settled so that he can again rejoin his
family.”
“But it is not the refusal of his consent that I
fear—it is that I cannot bear-oh! I cannot

bear to leave him—to leave him in prison and
sorrowful—and to go away to enjoy myself.
Oh! no, you must go alone; you must, indeed.
And when you have seen your uncle –”
“Beatrice, it is you that must see my uncle,
or that he must see. I have flurried you; I will
leave you; I will come again to-morrow after-
noon, very late, after Mrs. Myra Grey shall have
called, and you will find it all settled.”
It was all settled ! So far from Captain
Brooke objecting, he sent his “thankful compli-
ments” to Mr. and Mrs. Grey, for taking his poor
Beatrice this pleasant continental trip, out of hot
anxious London: out of the strange, difficult po-
sition of living in lodgings at Charing Cross, with
her father in the Queen’s Bench, and her sister so
much away. And so far from the gentlemanlike
solicitor objecting, he received one of those indirect
impressions from his wife which he never could
exactly account for, that he was not only doing a
kindness to a man who, his professional acumen
told him, had been cruelly cheated, instead of
cheating, in the speculation he had engaged in-
but also a very pleasing civility to Lady Eudocia
Wollingham; the Brookes being related to her on

the husband's side, and, of course, the temporary
cloud under which they were suffering, an annoy-
ance to her !
Mrs. Myra Grey called, just at the time Maurice
Lewellyn was calling, to whom she was introduced,
and on whom her dark eyes rested with infinite
expression as she said slowly that he was “so like
his father, whom she had seen when a child, that
she would have known him anywhere.”
And after she was gone, Maurice Lewellyn said
that he was glad Beatrice was to have this holiday,
but he wished it could have been with other com-
pany; for though Grey was a thorough gentleman,
he did not think, by what he had heard his father
say, that his wife was an estimable person, though
he had never heard any distinct circumstances
about her.
And then Treherne arrived; and his glad spark-
ling eyes made sunshine in the small drawing-
room. And after a few days of preparation, and
a tearful parting with her father and dear good
Mariana, Beatrice Brooke and her portmanteau,
furnished with the neatest of travelling dresses,
and an assortment of pencils and sketch-books to
immortalise the scenes she was to visit, were

carried off by Mrs. Myra Grey and her husband
to the South-Eastern railway, out of hot fevered
London, away to pleasant unknown romantic lands,
– away to Italy, her mother's native country, -
away to realise the blessed dream of obtaining
the good old uncle's consent to make two young
hearts happy!
Treherne did not go with them. That would
have been foolish—impossible; he did not even
go by the same route. But he somehow contrived
to time his journey so well, that he was standing
on the steps of the Albergo Reale, on the Grand
Canal, only the second day after his arrival, as if
he had been waiting there ever since their de-
parture to hand out of the gondola Mrs. Myra
Grey, -and Beatrice, looking most joyous, most
beautiful, and a little sunburnt. -
“I am so glad you are come,” said he, with
agitated eagerness. “I will go and tell my uncle
you are arrived. He desired I would let him
know, that you might all dine with him the day
you came; he has superb apartments in the
Palazzo close by. I told him I had seen Mr.
Grey before I left England, and that I thought it
would be the end of this week before he could be

here. He is a valetudinarian, as you know, Mr.
Grey, but a very pleasant one; very chatty and
amusing. I told him Miss Brooke was travelling
with you,-and was a connection of the Wolling-
hams,—and he trusts to see her with you; he
begged his very kindest remembrances to Mrs.
Myra Grey, and hoped she had not forgotten
him.”
Mrs. Myra glanced towards her husband,
and murmured, “How could she forget him?
How kind he had been to her in those disastrous
days, when she was ‘little more than a child, and
with her old husband, and her still older friend,
felt “almost as if she had two fathers. How
much also he had done for her | She would be a
very ungrateful creature to forget him!” and
Myra sighed. And then, with quite a different
sigh (for she was an adept in every variety of
sighing), she lifted her languid eyes to Treherne,
and said that nevertheless it would be very trying
to her to see her old friend again. “After such
changes — such changes! And after such a time

as they do in London, Treherne had arranged
that after dinner they would go to the opera, and
row in the moonlight on the canals.
And as all was planned, so all was done. When
first Myra entered the stately room in the Palazzo,
where the ex-Governor resided, she was half
inclined to have made a little sentimental scene,
but the possibility was denied her. Time’s “effac-
ing finger” had almost rubbed her out, on the
polished surface of that old man's heart; and she
herself was so amazed at the alteration in his
appearance—so thunderstruck at the bald, slim,
senile elegance of the black thin-legged THING in
an evening dress that advanced to meet her—
, instead of the fine, erect, martial-looking man in
a uniform covered with orders, whom she re-
membered—that she was perforce natural.
She was angry with him too, before the first few
seconds were passed, after her entrance and pre-
sentation. The quick instinct of woman told her,
even while she curtsied to that astute “princi-
pessa,” Madame Gouglokoff Oltakoff, that her
story was known; and that she was looked at with
inspecting and half-contemptuous eyes by that
smiling Russian, who, as she retreated from the

general presentation, murmured behind her fan
to her husband, “Oui; elle a di étre fort
belle.”
Women do that sort of thing very well—even
their praise becomes contemptuous on such occa-
sions. “Yes, she must have been very pretty—
that creature I had a curiosity to see, because she
was once the toy of your fancy.”
Myra tried to comfort herself by the evidence
that at least she was the junior by some years of
the fair powdered grande dame, with light hair
crépédin unimaginably thin curls, who stood in the
position she had once aspired to as Sir Pierrepoint's
wife—but to what purpose was such comfort? or
what did the elegant dinner-giver care? The man
of fifty-five had been most assishly in love with
the slender Hindoo, the wife of the collector of
Burrumpootra; but the man of eighty-six loved his
Gouglokoff, — who was so witty and gossiping,
who knew so well how to “tenir salon,” who was
familiar with the stories of Potemkin and Platoff,
and all the historical intrigues not only of the
court of St. Petersburg, but of every other court
in Europe; and who sat there triumphantly doing
the honours with grace and finesse; granting, to

each of the persons present, the exact degree
of courtesy it was fit she should accord,—but
making Myra somehow feel, by her cold fami-
liarity, as if she were spoken to from the steps of
a throne.
Not that at any time of her life the Gouglokoff
had feared a rival—had such a thing as a rival
ever presented itself, speedily would she have gone
a-mousing after her, and caught her in her claws,
and snapped her up in one mouthful; but she
had a certain vague dislike to the Hindoo ad-
venturess,— and somehow Myra never felt so
strongly that she was married to the family
lawyer, as she did that evening in presence of
Pierrepoint's Russian wife. The angry blood
oozed hotly to her cheek, though it brought no
colour there, at the scrutinising glances bestowed
by the Russian lady on the necklace of uncut
emeralds and pendent pearls which she wore that
night (having, like all Orientals, a passion for
jewellery); and many a look and many a slight,
which were none the less bitter for being unseen
by others, did she receive in silence. -
But this unequal battle between the faded ones
was unnoticed by the elegant old Caérlaverock.

He was occupied entirely with Beatrice. Always
a great admirer of beauty, he had seen the
beautiful women of most of the countries of
Europe; yet he asked himself now if he had ever
seen anything so charming as this young girl—
so gentle and yet so merry; so conversable, and
yet so modest; so earnest, and yet so simple; so
brimful of the spirit of playful retort, and yet with
such perfect taste as to what should be said or left
unsaid. He was enchanted with her. He stood
on his weary thin legs for a whole hour after
dinner, bending over her while she took her
coffee; pointing out to her the pictures on the
walls of the room; displaying curious old snuff-
boxes and antique gems and seals, collected and
presented to him by many a foreign potentate in
his long career.
He took both her hands when she was going away,
and appealed to his Gouglokoff whether she was
not “charmante,” and Gouglokoff bent her crépéd
curls and kissed the straight fine forehead under
its rich plait of burnished brown hair, and smiled
and said, “Mais certainement oui, charmantel”
with an emphasis that did duty for enthusiasm.
And then, blushing, laughing, and looking back to

the last, to answer Lord Caërlaverock's final sen-
tences of jest and praise, and hope to see her again
in a day or two, Beatrice descended the wide mag-
nificent stairs of the Palazzo leaning on Tre-
herne's arm, followed by Myra and Mr. Grey.
And at the bottom of the stairs, on the marble
flagstones, they stood till the nimble gondoliers
pushed the gondola close in under the archway of
the court, and shot out into the splendid moonlight,
down the magnificent canal to the opera house:
coming from the silver silence of that watery road
into the sudden gush of light and sound; into the
dazzle of gay dresses, and throngs of people, and
the sound of rich music, “married” to tender
words in that language made for singing,-the
wooing Italian tongue !
And out again when that scene of melody and
acted passion was over, to the sweeter realities of
life.
Again the silver shining of those moonlit
waters, glassy with stillness; again the glorious
“palaces going by like a dream;”

murmured pleasant sentences from Montagu's
voice in its lowest, fondest undertone—“Oh ! was

uncle welcomed you; you see what an impression

night; again the confident hope in the “to-
morrow;” again the quiet of the happy sleep
and the glory of prophetic dreams.

CHAPTER XIV.
THE DREAM WANISHES.
IT had been understood between Treherne and
Beatrice that she was not to expect to see him
till very late the next day, probably not till the
evening, after his uncle's dinner was over, when
all had been explained, and his consent pleaded
for and obtained. The earlier morning was to be
spent in discussing Lincolnshire mortgages and
legal possibilities with Mr. Grey. A mass of
papers had to be read through, and it would be a
fatiguing day for old Lord Caérlaverock. So
Beatrice, when she woke, and the sunshine that
shimmered through the green blinds and fell with
a trembling ripple on the marble floor, reflecting
the rippling of the water beneath, felt that she
had a day in Venice at her own disposal.
She had hoped that Mrs. Myra Grey would pro-

pose to see something of that strange City of the
Sea in which they found themselves. But the
solicitor's wife was dispirited and discontented,
and in no mood for anything but the most
Indian-looking lounge on the faded yellow sofa
of the lofty room. She told Beatrice they had
“better rest a day after all their journeying.”
But Beatrice needed no rest, and thirsted
to go out. She gazed on the canal and
bridges till her eyes ached with the sun-
shine; and every gondola that glided past, carried
with it her desire to be one of the occupants.
Luckily for the prolonged impatience in
which her day seemed likely to be wasted,
visitors were announced. An old Dr. Bretton
and his wife, and two Miss Brettons, who were
staying in the same hotel, and had seen the
names of the new arrivals in the “Livre des
Voyageurs.” Good honest Tenbyites; whom
Beatrice had known long since, when Dr. Bretton
preached there, and took in three pupils of whom
Maurice Lewellyn had been one. They were re-
ceived very joyously, and almost immediately
began inquiring what Beatrice had seen or had
not seen. She had only arrived the day before.

They had been there a fortnight, but Dr. Bretton
had had a good deal of flying gout, and they
had not “done” much, in consequence. Would
Beatrice like to go with them now and see St.
Mark's, and the Library, and all the glad and glo-
rious sights they could cram into one day? Bea-
trice clapped her hands for joy: and on reference
to Mrs. Myra Grey, that lady professed the ut-
most willingness that Miss Brooke should “spend
the day” with her Tenby acquaintances, dine and
drink tea with them. And leaning back on the
faded sofa with a sigh rather more real than
usual, she composed herself for a day's rest.
Great was the surprise of Beatrice when, her
long day's pleasure being over, and the hour come
(at last) when she thought it likely Treherne
might call, she returned to the apartments in the
Albergo Reale, and found neither Mr. Grey nor his
wife. The candles were not lighted; moonlight
only, came soft and bright into the sitting-room.
She knocked gently at Myra's bed-room door,
but there was no answer, and she feared to disturb
her by repeating it. She went back into the
sitting-room, and rang for lights. It would be
awkward if Treherne came, and Mr. Grey out,

and his wife retired to rest, but still it would be a
happy accident, for they could talk more freely of
what had passed between him and his uncle, than
in whispered sentences on the balcony, or at the
far end of the room.
The waiter who answered the bell apologised.
He did not know the Signorina had remounted
to her apartment. He had seen the Signorina
enter from the gondola with the English Dottore
and his party. He had not observed the Sig-
norina since. He had a letter for the Signorina
from the lady her companion of yesterday even-
ing. The Signora was imperative with him to
give it to the Signorina immediately on her
return. Would the Signorina wish anything
more — any lemonade, or ice? No.
The nimble waiter vanished; and lost in amaze-
ment, Beatrice read the following note from
her travelling companion:-
“MY DEAR MISS BROOKE,
“Circumstances, impossible to detail in a
note which I am obliged to leave at the hotel,
but connected with the important law busi-
mess which brought Mr. Grey here, compel him

instantly to start for Florence. And as he is quite
uncertain how many days the business may occupy
him, or which day he could return, we have ac-
cepted the very kind offer of the Princess Gouglo-
koff to consider you under her charge till we can
look a little further into our plans. I am sorry
the accident of your being out with the Brettons
prevents my wishing you good-bye; but it is so
far satisfactory to me, that you will only have to
go to bed on coming home, and in the morning
early the Princess will send for you. All is
settled at the hotel. Mr. Grey begs his kindest
compliments, and I am
“Always yours very sincerely,
“MYRA GREY.”
What did it mean P What could it mean? It
was perfectly inconceivable! Was it joy? was it
sorrow? Could the Gouglokoff be taking charge
of her as Treherne's betrothed and accepted wife?
Beatrice was still sitting, looking in a sort of
stupor at the often-read note, when she heard the
grating of a gondola against the steps of the
hotel; and in a few minutes more the light rapid
step, so well known, so welcome, the one step in

the world—his step—was heard, and Treherne
made his appearancel
No, it was not joy; it could not be joy; some-
thing had gone wrong—very wrong. His coun-
tenance wore an expression of mingled anger and
vexation, such as she had never seen before. He
looked sharply and defiantly round the room.
“Are those people gone to bed, or are they likely
to interrupt us while I speak with you?”
Beatrice silently put the letter into his hand.
At first he seemed as perplexed as she herself
had been: then he said, with an impatient ex-
clamation and angry compression of his lips—
“I see it all; I understand perfectly what they
mean to do. Not so easily baffled as that, my
friends ! Beatrice, will you wait for me here
for half an hour? never mind its being late, this is
not a moment for ceremony. I will come back
and explain everything to you. Do not be vexed.
Fear nothing, and expect me back again as soon
as I have made out what I wish to know.”
He was gone again, and the bewildered girl
stood at the open window, watching one gondola
after another shoot over the canal, and the lights
come out and die away, and people land on the

steps of the hotel, and the hotel begin to get
extremely quiet, as though most of its inmates
were gone to rest. The notion of this calm made
her restless. Where could Treherne be? Surely
it was much more than half an hour, more than
an hour, since he was gone? Could anything
have happened to him 7 Could he have quarrelled
with anyone on her account? What sudden
stroke of discomfort had overtaken them all?
Just as her heart was beginning to beat hard and
quick, fearing she scarcely knew what, Treherne
reappeared. He was extremely pale; he came
rapidly across the room as she turned from the
window, and took her hand.
“Beatrice,” he said, “will you trust me? will
you rely upon me, instead of upon strangers?
If you cannot act with decision at this moment,
between this and to-morrow morning we shall be
utterly parted. I want you to come down to the
gondola, now, without waiting. You still have
your bonnet and scarf on, get your cloak; it is
rather chill. I cannot talk to you here; come with
me on the canal. Where is your cloak? can I
get it? Which is your room?”
Beatrice trembled—she wondered—but she did

not like to refuse that agitated prayer. She did
not know what to do, or what to think. Certainly
his uncle had not consented to their marriage;
that was her only distinct idea.
“I will get my cloak in a moment,” she said;
“my room is the one within this.”
Treherne took up the light, and looked at the
number of the room. He opened the door on
the stairs, where one of his gondoliers was
waiting. -
“Antonio,” he said, “you will see everything
that remains in these two rooms – 18 and 19 in
the hotel—brought down to the boat: the signora
will not have time to overlook their removal; you
will cord any box, and make packages of any
articles not packed; you will receive two louis
d’ors from me, when you have brought them, and
you will give that ten francs to the waiter. You
understand P.”
“Excellency, yes!”
“Beatrice! Are you ready?”
“I was locking my box and my desk. I have
no maid: Mrs. Grey's maid gave me what little
assistance I required, and I thought I had better
not leave the things so scattered about, if there is

no one in the apartment. To-morrow morning,
she says, the Princess is to send for me. What
can it all mean?”
“Come down; come, dear. We will talk in the
gondola, Beatrice!”
But they did not talk; he sat by her for a few
minutes, shut in, in that strange coffin-like boat, in
utter silence. Then he sighed, and passed his
hand over his forehead; and then buried his face
in both hands, and muttered, “Oh! such a day of
storm, and quarrel, and disappointment, Bea-
trice.” Then he rose and opened the door of the
gondola, and stepped out into the boat, and spoke
impatiently to the gondoliers — apparently to
hurry them, for they increased the already swift
speed at which they were going. Then he re-
turned,—leaving the doors open,—and resumed his
seat; and Beatrice said, gently: “Now let me
know what has happened; do not fear to vex me;
after all, your uncle's refusal can only delay our
marriage. I guess he has refused. Yet it is
surely kind of Princess Gouglokoff to charge
herself with me: what I cannot understand is,
why the Greys could not wait for me.”
“I understand it all perfectly, Beatrice. I

must begin at the beginning, for it is a long story.
But first—”
Again he stepped out of the covered part of
the gondola, and she saw his graceful figure be-
tween her and the moonlight; watching, as it
seemed, for some other gondola to overtake
them. The wind blew fresher, and fewer gon-
dolas were visible; that glassy stillness was
no longer on the water, which now ruffled
brightly beneath them in ripples that as they
still sped on grew almost to waves. She heard
Treherne call eagerly to some one, “Antonio, is .
it you?”
“Excellency, yes.”
“Have you got the things?”
“Excellency, all are here; there was no diffi-
culty.”
“Good. Be quick then; we shall be late;
follow close !”
Once again, and the wind seemed to blow
fresher and fresher, and the water was like the
open sea on a fine night. In a few minutes more,
the gondola glided alongside of a dark floating
mass, which a hissing sound told Beatrice could
only be a steamer. Treherne came back to her in

the covered part of the boat; he clasped her hands
in his. He said, “Trust me, Beatrice; only trust
me.” The poor girl trembled.
“Oh!” she said, “let us do nothing wrong
and rash and passionate; nor brave your guardians
and relations. Let us be patient. My father
would never excuse or countenance—”
Loud calls and confusion of cries on board the
steamer; threats of instant departure from some
one who stooped over the side and shouted to
Treherne. He lifted her from her seat; he kissed
her on the forehead; he said, “It is but six
hours; we are only going to cross to Trieste; we
will be married there; and when it is all irrevo-
cable, we shall find it perfectly easy to calm
matters down. As soon as it is impossible I
should marry the person they intend for me,
there will be no motive for them to stand out.
Antonio has brought all your baggage from the
Albergo. Come!”
Again the shouts from the steamer. Beatrice
was dizzy and faint:
“The person they intend for me,”—He,—her
Treherne,—married to some other bride! The
words rung in her ears; she was conscious of no

other idea; who did they want to marry him to ?
Who P
She was lifted from the boat to the deck of the
steamer, with her eyes still fixed in wild question-
ing on his face. “Who could they want to marry
him to?” There was despair in the very thought.
The two gondolas shot silently from the side of
the steamer, and in a moment were but as two
black lines drawn on the water; the paddles
of the vessel they were in, beat with a slow
hesitating and then rapid movement; the die
was cast—they were off!
“Now, my child, sit down here in the moon-
light, and I will make everything as clear to you
as that cloudless sky. You shall never repent this
step; never, Beatrice, never!”
She had, then, eloped !
She looked around with a wild frightened gaze -
at the sea and sky, and burst into tears.
“Oh! Beatrice,” murmured the young man
passionately, “my life shall be made up of thanks
to you.”

CHAPTER XV.
CUPID AND HYMEN.
THE day had indeed been, as Treherne said, “one
of storm and quarrel.” After the fatiguing busi-
ness of the Lincolnshire mortgages had been got
through, Treherne half meditated a delay in his
announcement to the elegant old guardian who
stood in the enviable position of “Head of the
Family.” But he dreaded lest some accident,-
a letter from Lady Eudocia commenting on the
continental trip undertaken by Miss Brooke,
simultaneously with his own visit to Venice;
or a meeting with The Marchioness, who was also
abroad on some wandering tour or other,—should
forestal and neutralise the effect of his intended
confession.
He therefore brusqué'd his avowal with the
most eager rapidity, during a brief pause in

the running commentary of praise bestowed
by the Earl of Caërlaverock on “that charm-
ing Beatrice;” who was, he said, more beau-
tiful than a Narischkin he had once known,—
more agreeable than his little favourite, Princess
Soltikoff,-more playful than his former “grande
passion,” the daughter of the governor of Tcher-
naya,—and as spirituelle,—no—almost as spirit-
uelle, as his own Gouglokoff! and he laid his
diaphanous and slender hand on the ring-circled
fingers of that fair and faded Russian as he
spoke.
The acquiescing and somewhat artificial smile
on the lips of the Gouglokoff altered to a little
round ‘o’ of the frankest astonishment, changing
to a hearty laugh and “je m'en doutais,”—as
Treherne without farther preface exclaimed,—“I
am so glad you like Miss Brooke, my dear uncle,
—for I intend to make her my wife l’’
Lord Caérlaverock contemplated his nephew
with silent amazement for some moments, and
then replied: “It is very well that you thought
of mentioning so foolish an idea, mon garçon, in
good time to understand from me, that such a
marriage is de toute impossibilité.”

“It is a marriage I have determined on, never-
theless.”
“It is a marriage which we will not permit.”
“If by “we, you mean yourself and my
other guardians, the attempt to prevent it will
prove fruitless; you may delay it till I am legally
of age (and so produce eternal alienation between
me and those who oppose it); but no human
power shall prevent my marrying whom I please.”
“And it is your royal will and pleasure to
espouse your bergère at all hazards? Then, my
young prince, we must read to you some more
documents (though we have had a good dose of
law papers this morning) in order to change that
opinion;” and the old man rung with a trembling
hand the bell on his writing table.
“Luigi, desire Mr. Grey to come here from the
apartment where he is writing, and to bring with
him the papers he brought from England.”
“Now, young prince,” added he, in the tone of
irony he had already adopted towards the excited
young man, “you shall hear read a synopsis of
the will of my excellent brother; and I advise
you to extend your tour afterwards to so many
pleasant places that you shall quite forget this

inamorata; for it is a love-dream that never can
be realised.”
“Reading fifty wills will not alter my determi-
nation.”
“ Ta, ta, ta; that we shall see; here is
Mr. Grey.”
The will was read, or rather the extracts from
it, by which the Earl already gathered to his
ancestors, endeavoured to coerce the conduct and
apportion the fortunes of those who were to
succeed him. Treherne was gradually enlightened
by the information that his choice in wedlock was
bounded to the five daughters of Lady Eudocia
• Wollingham, if he ever desired to inherit the
large estates which did not necessarily go with the
title. That if he remained unmarried——“then
and in that case,”—or if he declined such choice—
“then and in that case,”—or if he had no heir–
“ then and in that case,”—the property was to
accumulate till another generation gave another
chance of a marriage on the same assorted condi-
tions; of cousin with cousin—male and female-
and if it were still the obstinate determina-
tion of destiny to throw difficulties in the
way of the deceased Earl's intentions as to the

property—“then and in that case,”—another
accumulation for another possible marriage in
another generation; only if Montagu died un-
married, without even a female child to succeed
him and render a marriage with some male
baby possible,—“then and in that case,” Maurice
Lewellyn, if making a marriage with one of
Lady Eudocia's daughters, might inherit; and if
there were no such marriage, his son on making
a like marriage in the next generation, &c., &c.;”
—with every entanglement of legal terms and
legal suppositions, till at last the will sounded as
if “then and in that case” no one would ever get
anything at all.
Treherne heard it out, with a flushed cheek and
an angry eye. When Mr. Grey paused, he said:
“I never heard such a farrago of nonsense in all
my life.” -
“Your grandfather's will, a farrago of non-
sense?”
“Certainly. The will of a man in the last
stage of dotage; and I will marry Beatrice, and .
have it set aside by Act of Parliament.”
“You are an insolent young puppy, Monsieur
mon neveu!” said the old peer, with a bitter smile.

Treherne rose. Mdme. Gouglokoff rose too,—
and standing behind the great red velvet chair
in which her irate lord was leaning back, pitting
his weak voice and strong will against the younger
combatant,-she bent over him, and said:—“Do
not let us scold and call names; we know what a
tyrant Mr. Cupid is, and how foolish he makes
people seem, for a minute, who are not really
foolish at all; ” and she smiled and nodded at
Montagu. Unappeased by the smile or the com-
pliment, Treherne took his hat to go. “I have
told you my resolution,” he said, “and I will stand
to it.”
“Not here, young gentleman;—not here, if I
have any influence with the English authorities
in Venice.”
“Here, or elsewhere, it matters not; it con-
cerns no one but myself.”
“It does concern others, insolent boy!” said
the old earl, trembling with wrath at this open
braving; “it does concern others. You imagine,
I presume, that I have inherited the interest of
all this property?”
“No, I know you have not; not all of it;—I
have heard my aunt say so.”

“Do you know what I have inherited; and on
what conditions?”
“No, I do not. I never considered it any
business of mine, and never had any curiosity on
the subject.”
“Very well; then you shall know now, if you
can govern your temper and your manners enough
to be seated for a few minutes longer. Mr. Grey,
I will thank you to read the clauses affecting
guardianship.”
Again Treherne listened to renewed sentences
of perplexity: appointing the deceased Wolling-
ham, the Honourable Pierrepoint Treherne, and
John Claverhouse Grey, Esq., of Lincoln's Inn,
guardians; and providing that in the event of
Pierrepoint's succeeding to the title, he should
inherit twelve thousand a year (as ample “for a
man without family”), and John Claverhouse
Grey six hundred a year; but if “from any
indulgence of the wayward fancies of youth,” any
attempt should be made to pervert the intentions
of the testator by consenting to any marriage,
other than was indicated by the will; and if, by
any carelessness,—by want of due precaution, ex- .
ercise of authority, or means of prevention,—such

a marriage were accomplished without consent of
guardians, “then and in that case” a sort of penal
forfeiture was imposed: the Honourable Pierre-
point's earldom was left to support itself on five
thousand a year, and the solicitor's handsome
bequest of income was completely annulled!
Intolerable to Treherne was the angry trembling
sneer with which old Lord Caérlaverock—point-
ing to the paper as Mr. Grey folded it up again—-
wound up the measure of his endurance, by saying,
“There, young gentleman, that is my brother's
will; and though you are pleased to speak of it
as a farrago of nonsense,—yet as I do not believe
any power in England could set it aside; and as, if
it were possible to prove he had no power to dis-
pose of the estates, they would then revert to the
family of my mother, to whom they originally
belonged; and as I do not wish to pay twelve
thousand a year to see you married to Miss
Brooke, with my consent, or seven thousand a year
to know you married without my consent, for
want of as much care to prevent it as I can take,
I warn you that I shall resist to the very utmost,
all such plans of marriage on your part.”
“Mr. Grey,”—said Treherne.

The gentlemanlike solicitor started. “I hope,
my dear sir, you do not think of appealing to me.
I can only confirm your uncle's judgment in this
matter; I cannot perceive a shadow of doubt as
to the course we are bound to pursue; irrespective
of any interests of our own—of any interests but
yours. You are young to make a choice—and—”
“And,” said the Gouglokoff, with her Russian
smile, “you may some day wish to make another

not to stand——which shall not stand. If, however,
I have seemed discourteously impatient in the pre-
sence of a lady, I apologise for that, most readily.”
And with a haughty bow which, beginning at
Gouglokoff’s eyes,—was somehow made to in-
clude the trio,-taking in, in its semi-circular
sweep, the velvet chair with its angry occupant
—the silent lawyer,-and the table on which lay
the obnoxious will,—rebellious Montagu rapidly
descended that marble stair where the evening
before Beatrice's arm had rested in his; and
throwing himself into the gondola, went straight
to the Albergo Reale.
But Beatrice was out, as we have seen,
“pleasuring” with the Brettons; and Mrs.
Myra Grey, whom he desired in his perplexity
to speak with, was, as her maid expressed it,
“in a most heavenly slumber;” so Montagu
went down again to his boat, and fevered him-
self more and more with impossible plans, until
at last the time came when the Brettons had
returned, and he knew he should find Beatrice
in the Greys' apartment.
No sooner had he left Lord Caërlaverock than

that irate and experienced envoy turned angrily
round upon Mr. Grey: “What is the meaning of
this girl coming here with you, at the same time
as Montagu, if this is the state of things between
them?” *
Grey's thoughts reverted to his wife and to
the false impressions she had given him; and the
irritation communicating itself to each of the
perplexed party in succession, fixed itself in his
case on Mrs. Myra, as the contriver of his present
embarrassment.
It was agreed, on consultation between Lord
Caërlaverock and his solicitor, that the Greys
should immediately leave Venice; and transfer
their charge of Captain Brooke's daughter to
Princess Gouglokoff, who would “communicate
with her friends.” Mr. Grey then returned home.
He had little respect for Myra's “heavenly slum-
ber.”
He woke her hurriedly and angrily: he
said, “What intrigue or folly made you persuade
me to bring with me a young lady who it seems
has planned to marry Treherne? You have seen
these people; I have not; it was he who asked
you to allow her to accompany us; you must
have known how the case stood.”

“Known,-known,”—said Mrs. Myra, sleepily
and peevishly. “If I knew that Montagu
Treherne admired the girl, I could not know he
meant to be fool enough to marry her.”
The solicitor's grave and sensible face wore so
dark an expression of questioning at this speech,
that his wife felt positively alarmed. “Dear me,”
she said, “whatever I have done to please and
humour Mr. Treherne, has always been done in
your interest—for your future! He will be earl.
Suppose he did marry—then, in that future—”
“Let my future alone, woman; and let me
forward my own fortunes as an honest man should,
and as I hope I always have done. You will
severely injure me, as it happens, and deprive your
own children of the income left to me. I never
spoke to you of the old lord's will—why should I?
but by its provisions this future earl of yours will
be a beggar, or very nearly so, and I shall lose six
hundred a year through your folly. Now get up
and dress—and pack—we leave this place in
an hour.”
A flash shot out of Myra's Hindoo eyes, but
they relapsed into sullen languor. “I will be
ready,” was all she said. She felt instinctively

that it would not be prudent to say more. She
had occasionally seen Mr. Grey in the imperative
mood, and she had no desire to be a wave beating
against a rock.

CHAPTER XVI.
FOREIGN TRAVEL.
“Do you not understand, my Beatrice,” said
Treherne, when he had narrated as much of the
foregoing recital, as personally concerned him,
“that if you had remained with the Greys, it
would have been almost impossible to prevent our
seeing each other. Grey would never have dared,
Mrs. Myra would never have dared, to refuse me
admittance: but the Princess Gouglokoff, in my
grand-uncle's house, would certainly have kept you
as a sort of state prisoner. She never would have
permitted you to be absent from her; and, after
what had passed, she would have forbidden my
visits till you were gone. Till you were gone,

great a misery was near, and that now we are
together for ever. But you must be weary: I

will go and see if there is a good cabin, and
you shall go below and lie down, till we come
into port.”
Treherne did not return for some minutes; and
Beatrice, who had risen, and restlessly walked to
and fro on the deck, looking with anxious sor-
rowful perplexed eyes at the cloudless heavens,
the silvery waves, and the dark cordage and
black chimney of the steamer–stopped in her
walk, for she heard his voice in tones of unmis-
takeable and excessive anger; an altercation
carried on in an Austrian patois, of which she
could make out little or nothing.
He rejoined her, took a turn or two with her on
deck, and then said abruptly —
“Beatrice, I solemnly swear to you — no, I will
not mock you by swearing, for I am sure you will
believe me.”
“Of course I would believe you; what vexes
you?”
“The strangest thing has occurred; the hurry,
the agitation, the confusion which those con-
founded fellows, the gondoliers, make of names
and places: in short, when I left you after read-
ing Mrs. Grey's letter, I resolved on this: I

mean I resolved on trying to persuade you to
leave Venice.”
“You did not give me much choice,—Mon-
tagu,” said Beatrice half tenderly, half reproach-
fully, with a wistful sort of smile.
“No: dear, there was not time for considera-
tion. I went home and arranged for my own
departure; and I sent Jacopo (would I had sent
Antonio instead of that dolt!) to ascertain what
steamers there were for Trieste to-night, and take
a cabin for you, - but I find —” .
“Is that all? that there is no cabin P oh!
believe me, I want no rest; I am happier, less
nervous, on deck talking to you.”
“No, no: would to heaven that were all! It
is not that, -but these fellows have made some
desperate mistake. I really hardly know how to
tell you, after promising you but six hours of sea;
but they have not put us on board the steamer
for Trieste.”
“No! good heavens !”
“They have put us on board a merchant
steamer going from Trieste to Alexandria,
touching at Venice. I thought it seemed smaller
and less well appointed than the Trieste boats,

and going below to see the cabin, I found the
whole thing was a mistake.”
Beatrice trembled from head to foot; she did
not speak for some seconds. Then she clasped
her hands, and murmured —
“My father; my dear father !”
“Dear, if you will take courage,” urged Tre-
herne, “I assure you I have thought of every-
thing. We will be married at the English
consulate at Alexandria, and take passage in the
returning steamer. I will write to Mrs. Myra
Grey to await us; she dare not return to Eng-
land without you ! Our marriage need not be
declared till we get home. In short, dear, if you
will but trust me, I will answer for your seeing
your father before he hears or knows anything of
what has occurred. These people had no right to
leave you in the way they did. Keep a cheerful
heart and trust me. We are not the first couple
who have eloped to get married and been very
happy afterwards; and we shall not be the last.
Do not fear, my Beatrice.”
Do not fear ! How often in this world of
terror and trouble has that phrase been spoken,
how often will it yet be spoken—in vain.

Beatrice's fear and despondency gained the
mastery for a time, even over Montagu's power of
soothing her.
Yet there was nothing for it but patience; and
the alarm and agitation with which she had first
received the intelligence that they were not
following in the track of her wily and selfish
chaperon, but putting a still greater distance be-
tween her and her father, subsided at last under
, the influence of Treherne's words of love and
comfort. Nothing was a real misfortune that left
her with him nothing could darken the radiant
certainty that she was soon to be his wife.
Soon, too, the weather, which had been so
lovely, changed to the wildest of those autumn
storms that ruffle the Adriatic. Foreign sailors
and foreign captains have somehow a more noisy
and less orderly way of doing their work than the
English. The shouting,—hurrying to and fro,-
creaking,-trailing of cordage, -shifting of bal-
last,-and groaning of the labouring and heavily-
laden little vessel; the asthmatic puffing of the
steam-funnel, the slow beat of the overstrained
wheels, the sudden crashing dash of some wave,
giving a sort of trembling shake to the whole

framework of the steamer, or rising, with a wild
leap, beyond the ship's side, and deluging the
decks with water,—all struck terror and bewilder-
ment into the poor girl's agitated heart.
She was no coward, she could have died bravely;
without a shriek, with a hopeful prayer; it was
not danger, it was not death, the thought of which
perpetually made her clasp her hands in anguish.
It was the thought of “the home news.” The
thought of her father and good pious Mariana
receiving the wondrous intelligence that she and
Montagu had perished together,—having eloped
from all natural friends and ties, –and no voice
there to justify them; no voice to comfort that
gallant old officer already bowed in undeserved
disgrace.
Remorse, for having in that bewildered last
hour in Venice, failed in the strength to stand by
her own sentence: “Let us do nothing wrong
or passionate; nor brave your guardians and re-
lations;” remorse, for having in that hour, thought
more of the chance of his marrying another, than
of all the steady words of denial she might still
have spoken; remorse, for not having resolutely
kept her seat in the gondola and insisted on

returning to the Albergo Reale; there to await
the painful morning, the uncertain future, the
alien care; all throbbed in hot miserable thoughts,
coursing each other with wild monotony round
and round her brain – till at last, repeated faint-
ing-fits, and the torment of sea-sickness, made
even thought itself impossible, and Beatrice re-
mained too ill to care for surrounding things!
There were other women on board; ladies,
though not quite of her own class; merchants’
wives, the captain's sister, all kind helpful and
compassionate as far as the illness of all mutually
permitted, and all more experienced in voyages
than Beatrice. She did not lack aid and sooth-
ing words, though they came from strangers.
And at last, the trying voyage came to an end.
The joyful news that they were soon to leave that
tossing prison for the firm land was communicated
to her by the captain; and the gale which had
blown during the voyage from Venice, subsided
to a calm as they neared the port of Alexandria.
The sun shone out there with a fierce and glowing
heat, and the sea seemed a moving mass of
diamonds, as the small steamer paddled slowly
through the crowded bay. Merchant vessels of

every nation lay at anchor, flags of every hue of
brilliancy fluttered in the breeze, and barges
passed and repassed, manned by dark Egyptian
crews naked to the waist, who pulled at their oars
with a monotonous song.
Trembling and giddy—with that peculiar gid-
diness which results from a sea-voyage and sea-
sickness—Beatrice leaned heavily on her lover's
arm as she landed. A dreadful smell of dead
fish, dirt, bruised eatables, hot beasts of burden,
and filthy human beings, assailed her senses; and
she saw,-rather as if it were in a dream than in the
vivid reality, -the motley crowds wearing costumes
such as she had only seen in books and pictures;
piles of eastern merchandise, guarded by brown
melancholy-looking men in white turbans, with
bright dark eyes like burning coals; long strings
of patient camels, irresistibly reminding her of
Bible-lessons and childish days; and the strange
haven donkeys with carpet saddles, tended by
wild ragged boys—the Ishmaels of the world-
desert of poverty.
Treherme spoke to her from time to time;
pointing out, as they landed, the various objects
which excite a stranger's curiosity. But in spite of

the effort made by her dizzy mind to comprehend,
—in spite of the faint smile of attention with
which she welcomed the sentences from that dear
voice,—she felt as if she only half existed. Little
she cared for the palace of Cleopatra, or the
palace of Caesar, or anything but the necessity of
getting somewhere to rest with a real silent rest,
if possible,—after the tossing of the sea, and the
creaking, shouting, and bustling which had so
exhausted her. Her soft eyes looked sleepily out
on the eager little vagabond who obeyed Mon-
tagu's sign for the hire of his donkey, -and,
lifted on that oddly-accoutred monture, a dream
seemed to lead her on through the narrow and
filthy lanes where the Arab poor congregate in
wretched hovels,—past mounds of indescribable
rubbish,-on into the heart of that city which is
half glory and half gloom,-half mud-coloured
walls, and half mosques and minarets and terraced
roofs, – into the Grand Square of the Frank
quarter.
There the houses were English-looking and
handsome. All the consuls lived there; their
dwellings distinguished by the floating over each
of its national flag; joining many a fleeting gleam

of diversified colour to the glittering kaleidoscope
of tints below.
There Beatrice saw, sweltering in the sun, ca-
mels kneeling with jet black slaves in crimson caps
arranging their burdens; women shrouded like
ghosts in long white veils, moving heavily along;
Turks sitting smoking, grave and silent; grooms
in petticoat trousers, leading horses with crimson
velvet saddles richly embroidered; while,—mov-
ing to some wild alien music such as she had
never heard before,—a detachment of odd-looking
soldiers, dressed in white cotton uniforms, marched
past her as she sat on the donkey led by her
ragged little guide; anxiously watched by Tre-
herne who saw that she was scarcely able to
support herself.
He saw her safe at length to the hotel, where
two of her fellow-passengers were also to take up
their abode; and whispering, as he pressed her
hand, “I must go to the English Consul’s, and
see about all arrangements, – sleep till I return,

SLEEP till I return. That, Beatrice was unable to
do. Wide and wakeful her eyes fixed themselves on
the new objects around her, and a strained sense
of listening which she would have given the
world to overcome, beat in her wearied ears.
But still it was rest—real rest at last—lying
there so still and shaded on soft cushions, with a
consciousness of safety after the wild sea-storm; of
a fresher air after the insupportable mingling of
evil odours on board the steamer; of quiet after the
dash of the insulting spray, that had made even
the change from the cabin to the deck comfort-
less; of satisfaction and peace in the thought that
Montagu was gone to arrange for their marriage, –
after the dreadful visionary anxiety that had
haunted her; the image of her father and Mariana
getting other dreary news!

In the midst of all the complicated sounds of
movement in the busy hotel, she distinguished the
youthfully rapid step of her companion ascending
the staircase. “Well, dear Montagu ?” she said
with a smile, as he entered hurriedly and sat down
by her.
“It is not well, it is not well, my own Beatrice:
indeed it is all like a bad dream,” exclaimed
Treherne with a vexed laugh, biting his lips,
and looking anxiously in her startled face. “The
very first person I saw at the English Consul’s
was the courier Brascodemi, who accompanied
my aunt, the Marchioness, abroad; she and Lord
Updown are here! And though she cares about
gothing but herself and her own interests in this
teeming world, yet her lord may choose to interfere
“for the sake of the family, and, at all events,
make such a scandal and struggle of our attempt to
get the ceremony performed, that I would rather, if
possible, avoid him. The courier told me that they
were going up the Nile, and after that they return
to winter at Cairo. If you were not utterly fatigued,
Beatrice, we might yet manage to elude them
altogether! If we could get away from hence till
they had started for their trip up the Nile, then

return here and sail for England by Marseilles,
they being at Cairo,—we should never meet;
there would be no row or difficulty. We must
be married as privately as possible, and trust
to all being hereafter made smooth. As to my
grandfather's will, it is simply absurd; and as to
his clauses of forfeiture, my guardians may comfort
themselves by the prospect of easy evasion, for
they have neither given consent, nor avoided taking
every precaution in their power against our mar-
riage—including the memorable plan of giving
you over as a sort of state prisoner to the Princess
Gouglokoff. I am sure I will give them a cer-
tificate of their strenuous opposition, and the tor-
ment they have inflicted on me.”
Treherne spoke with a sort of feverish rapidity,
and affectation of gaiety, but he watched Beatrice's
face with an anxious glance. She turned very pale,
and sighed, but she made no answer to his
harangue.
“My Beatrice, there is no going back: take
courage. The time that seems so long to you, be-
cause it has been crowded with unexpected events,
what is it in reality? A week, a fortnight, three
weeks, more or less. Why, you know that your

father expected you to remain away between two
and three months; and even told you that he
Knew the difficulty of writing regularly, or long
letters; and that if you kept a careful journal it
would satisfy him quite as well when you returned
to read it to him.”
The tears rose in Beatrice's eyes: the picture
of the sort of journal her father expected; the
little harmless pleasures; the account of new
places, scenery, pictures; the careless joys; the
safe return; the glad meeting; all that Mariana
and he were counting upon for her,—“the Pet of
the Home,”—contrasted with all the real heavy
perplexity of the time, smote her to the heart. But
there was, as Treherne said, “no going back;” and
there was, under all perplexities or fatigues of
body and mind, the one blissful certainty that
they were together; that they were to be to-
gether, sunshine or shade, all their lives, “till
death do us part,” and that his eyes were shining
down upon her at that very moment with unutter-
able love.
“I am tired, but not too tired to go on, if you
think it necessary. Where? How far? How long
should we be?”

“If you would, we might occupy the interval
in going to Suez; you would see something of
desert scenery; it would rest us; we would see
Cairo as we returned.”
“I feel as if we were pursued by the angel
with the flaming sword, Montagu ! There is
something ominous and dreary in the very acci-
dents against us.” Beatrice spoke with mournful
earnestness. With vehement passion Treherne
answered her.
“No accident that earth or heaven can send,
shall rob me of you, and for the rest I care not.
We are entering Paradise; we are not driven from
it. Beatrice, Beatrice! if you loved me but half
as well as I love you, you would rest quiet in the
one thought that now we cannot be parted!”
“You have no father, no sister, Montagu. But
as to not loving you—— l’ And Beatrice's eyes—
bright, weary, and tearful, all at once-spoke
the answer to his reproach.
Treherne's heart beat quick and fast; his one
absorbing thought was, as he had already ex-
pressed it, “No accident that earth or heaven
can send, shall rob me of you!”
And with that wilful and blaspheming thought

of earthly passion for his heart's one guide, he set
forth again with his companion. More tediously,
by canal and steamer, than the traveller of the
present day; but flying, as if indeed driven by a
flaming sword, past that sight on which the
traveller loves to linger-the beauteous city of
Haroun Alraschid springing from out its dark sea
of olives and acacia trees. The marvels of the
pyramids—the citadel of Saladin—the mosques
and tombs,—all these they were to see “on their
return.”
Beatrice began to feel ill and weary again;
but she did not like to complain; and she went
through the first bewildering portion of sandy
desert tract well enough. That strange journey,
as it used to be made,—with clumsy carriages
drawn by wild little Arab horses and steady mules,
driven by swarthy Nubians dressed in blue blouses
and white caps, shouting, yelling, cracking their
whips, flying from the city to the arid solitudes
beyond; the air sultry to suffocation; and the
wild rapidity of the overdriven cattle, — was
nevertheless very trying to the nerves of one
already so exhausted.
Sometimes a band of wandering Bedouins

passed like a swift picture; sometimes the
vehicles whirled past a long string of camels,
laden and patiently labouring on. Sometimes
the corpses only, of those meek burden-bearers —-
the “Ships of the Desert” as they are called,—met
Beatrice's startled eyes. Dead camels; skeleton
camels; camels in every stage of decomposition,-
with the great glutted and gorged vultures sitting
by and upon them, as if ruminating on their
past feast. Her companions were mostly persons
going to India—some sad—some hopeful; few
absorbed in that strange scene, even by its
strangeness—all anxious “to get on.”
And Treherne also was anxious to get on; but
when they reached the chief station in their flying
journey, the central station in the desert, Beatrice
could no longer resist confessing to him that she felt
too ill to proceed! A strange weariness and sense
of confusion—a weight in the head and oppression
at the heart—an indescribable sense of panic and
distress—took possession of her. In spite of the
sultry heat, she was seized with cold shiverings, and
a giddiness, more painful than all she had endured
on board the steamer, disturbed her aching brain.
At the station were beds, and couches, and
WOL. I. N

refreshment rooms—square whitewashed stone-
floored rooms, but not without comfort. Treherne
laid her on a divan in one of these, and determined
to remain the night; he had hurried her too much;
he reproached himself for want of care. He ordered
a bed to be prepared in as quiet a room as they
could obtain in that ungainly mass of building; he
asked for a female attendant, and a gentle Nubian
girl wh9 spoke a few words of broken English,
undertook to wait on the lady. He saw Beatrice
safely to the room provided for her, and returned
an hour or two afterwards, when the bustle of
departure of those who had continued their
journey was over, and the yelling cries of the
drivers of horses and mules, and the shrill scoldings
of those who were lading the camels, and all the
calling, ordering, explaining, and paying of the
cavalcade, had at length subsided into silence.
He hoped to find Beatrice better, but she
seemed to suffer much; great restlessness tor-
mented her; great pain at the heart; and her
eyes—her beautiful eyes had the strangest ex-
pression in the world! a mixture of muddiness
and lustre, such as may be seen in forest pools
full of dead brown leaves, when the autumn sun

shines down on them through the thin branches of
fading trees. The young Nubian watched her,
silent and motionless as a bronze statue, except
from time to time when some cooling drink was
offered to the parched and fevered lips of the
suffering girl.
It was an anxious night.
In the morning when Treherne again visited
her, she seemed better; but as the day ad-
vanced, her feverishness evidently increased, and
towards evening she was much worse, wandering
and inclined to stupor. Certainly she could not
proceed on her journey the next day.
No, nor the next—though she seemed for an
hour or two to be almost herself again, and spoke
of her departure, and of her vexation at the
delay, and thanked Treherne for all his care. Late
in the day, a change to greater fever than she
had yet suffered from, alarmed him by its
symptoms; later still, Beatrice was evidently
delirious !

THE FEWER.
TREMERNE was startled and confounded, almost
as much as he was grieved. Not only had he
eloped with Captain Brooke's daughter, but here
she lay sick, perhaps dying, without familiar
female attendance, without the possibility of
usual care. The people at the station did what
they could, but what could they do? There was
no medical man; no experienced matron; and a
very general fear that the young English lady
thus struck down by illness in the midst of her
journey, had the plague-fever, kept all at an
awe-struck distance from her room.
What was Treherne to do? He that had
vowed no accident that earth or heaven could
send, should rob him of Beatrice? What if that
great sunderer of human hearts, DEATH, were

suddenly to part them? The thought sent a cold
thrill into his veins as he looked at her; he
leaned, staggering and sick with the new fear,
against the wall of the room.
Did the fear smite his heart to repentance for
all the rashness that had brought them there?
No. He still thought more of his own pain, and
his own loss, than any other. Not of her distant
friends, but of his own immediate, unbearable, de-
spairing loneliness. Tempted men do not trans-
late their thoughts into clear language. He did
not say to himself, “Better that Beatrice Brooke
should run her chance of dying, nay, that she
should die, and the news reach her father and
sister with what confusion of circumstance it may,
—after I have seen her buried here, apart from all
friends, than that, — supposing she lives, –1
should have to bear the pang of losing the object
of the strongest passion I have ever experienced.”
He did not say this, even to his own perturbed
soul, but he felt it.
From time to time too, hope rose, buoyant and
light, to cheer him. When Beatrice seemed
herself; when he contemplated that rich and
vigorous beauty, the very ideal of some forest-

nymph of old, and nursed himself into the belief
that it was scarcely possible death could so freeze
with a touch, all that warmth and colour and
brightness, and alert energy of movement, he was
comforted. But as another day wore on into the
delirious night, and yet a new day only saw
intervals of stupefaction relieve intervals of
delirium, Treherne's perplexity and anxiety
increased to a degree he could no longer control.
He sent one summons after another to Cairo for
medical aid. Beatrice had almost ceased to
recognise him; that of itself was dreadful. It is
always dreadful, even to accustomed watchers of
the sick, when “the mind wanders,” when the
soul goes on some wild journey of its own, away
from direct human associations: fighting with
imaginary dangers, yearning for impossible de-
lights, living among flickering shadows, distorted
and amazing pictures that have their origin in
some faint magic-lantern reflection of past or
present life. The eyes that look at you, and do
not know you; is there any human sensation
of fear that equals the heart-throb that beats
under those glances?
Treherne had never watched by any sick-bed

before, except once. Except once! he remem-
bered that occasion; a college companion, a
young profligate lad who used to dawdle his
time away in the Viennese Chancellerie, when
Treherne was abroad; smoking and laughing and
recounting his conquests. He remembered that
lad's death; his raving—insane, indecent, pitiful
to hear. Snatches of wild drinking songs, jests
belonging to hours of mad debauchery; and in
the midst of all, his mother's name plaintively
moaned out, and his sister's. Treherne remem-
bered the great ecstatic terror of death that young
sinner showed, when he became temporarily
conscious, and aware of his danger; the nervous
despairing appeals to Treherne not to leave him
to die amongst strangers, not to forsake him;
and the wild delirious singing and shouting that
crossed and mingled with this despair. He re-
membered the dreadful death, the convulsive
battle of youth and strength with the final hour
of doom; the mother and sister coming—too late;
and his thinking, even while the gush of their
weeping was in his ears, that it was lucky they had
come too late to hear what he had heard; and only
saw the silent face, marble and cold and peaceful.

He remembered the look of the streaming eyes
and the faded face, when the widow thanked
him “for all his Christian care and goodness” to
that wayward and beloved Absalom of a lonely
home; and how suddenly and vividly those past
scenes of distress had been recalled to him years
afterwards by some fool's jest, telling him that
the girl whose brother had thus died, preserved
Treherne's visiting card in a little silk case in
her desk, with a lock of her brother's hair, as
something precious and infinitely sacred.
And now he was once more to watch and to
listen by a fever-bed. To wonder and to wait, doubt-
ing if youth or death would be strongest. Beyond
the horror of such doubting, there was no horror
here: poor Beatrice's wandering was the wander-
ing of an innocent soul, but of an innocent soul
in its first remorse. The one predominant im-
pression among her wrecked ideas was that she
was dying disgraced, dying without being married,
and without being able to explain to her father
how death had come so swiftly that he had over-

but full of agonised appeal. “Father, dear
father, forgive me!” was her piteous cry.
Fervent were her assurances of all Treherne's
goodness; but the thrill of pain was in all she
said. Sometimes she fancied herself again on
the tossing sea; sometimes wandering in the
cracks and crannies of a burning cave; sometimes
travelling over miles of arid, monotonous desert;
never finding that dear guide, Treherne; dying
alone on the sands, wasted and worn and feeble; vul-
tures and hungry birds of prey wheeling around her,
waiting for her death. With horror she waved her
arms above her head to scare away those visionary
torturers!
Then memory brought some shattered pic-
ture of other and calmer days. She thought
of Tenby. “Oh! if I could lean my cheek against
the cool white roses in the garden at ‘The Home,’
I should get well. I should get well. Send for
Mariana ! In that garden there are only English
birds; sweet birds, glad birds, small singing birds.
Carry me away and lay me there, among the cool
wet roses, the white moss roses, the roses in the
morning dew that we gathered for my father
before he was dressed ! Father, dear father, I was

married before I died; and they left me, -the
people who took me abroad; they left me; I did
not leave them. I went away with Montagu, it is
true, but they left me first. I was to have been
married, but I strayed away from Montagu in the
desert,-the dreadful Eastern desert,-nothing but
thorny plants with no sap in their leaves, nothing
but sand, the hot red sky, the burning sky and the
vultures, oh! the vultures.” Then, yet more
wildly, she exclaimed, “I see the skeletons of the
horses, and the men, and the camels, all white and
dry; there is nothing with any flesh left on it, but
me, in all this sandy plain, and the vultures are
coming to pick out my eyes.”
As in a dream, the real pain mingles with
the fancied suffering, her arms once more wildly
tossing, caught her long dishevelled hair on
Treherne's sleeve-buttons and tangled it there
as he bent over her. With a piercing shriek
she pushed him from her. “You are a vulture,”
she said: “you are a man-vulture, and you want
to eat my heart and my eyes.” Then, as even in
the fever-madness some faint memory of love and
peace crossed her brain, she muttered with a
wild painful smile; “No; you are a friend. Tell my

father I was to be married to-day, this very day,
but I died too soon.” She sank back exhausted;
and when she looked again at Treherme, it seemed
to him that death really was in her face. Sud-
denly she spoke more rationally though with great
excitement.
“Montagu,” she said, “dear Montagu, if we
could be married, it would spare my father half
his sorrow for me. Get a clergyman. Send back
to Cairo. Let him read the marriage service first,
and the burial service afterwards. Listen,” added
she, with a strange smile, as she half rose and
clung with both hands to his arm; “don’t let the
clergyman stop, even if I seem to die. You know
I may seem to die, I am so very weak; but don't
let him stop for that: let me die married. Oh!
Montagu, won’t you send for a clergyman? Go—
go! I do not fear being left; I do not fear any-
thing but my father getting the news that I died—
with you—and not married ! Will you not go, my
dearest ?”
The tone of anguished supplication went
through him like a knife. Her eyes seemed
lit by strange unearthly lamps; the scarlet in
her cheeks deepened as though the blood would

burst through the transparent skin. Montagu
rose, and went to ask if any medical man had
arrived from Cairo, in answer to his summons.
No; no one had yet come; but an English
family had just arrived,—a great noble family,
who had a doctor of their own travelling with
them. That was a mercy! Were there ladies in
the travelling group 2 Yes, there were ladies,
three; at least, two ladies and a lady's-maid—
a lady, her companion, and her lady's-maid.
Treherne went to the lady. He entered hurriedly,
with a brief apology, and beheld—The Marchio-
ness! She was sitting, fat and languid, on
cushions and shawls; her humble companion
was fanning her; her maid was unpacking the
thousand and one “little comforts,” without
which she could not travel. Her doctor, who
greatly desired to bid farewell to a young brother
on his way to join his regiment in India, had per-
suaded her that somehow it would be more for
her health and convenience to extend her tour
to the borders of the Red Sea at this especial
juncture, than later in the season; leaving part of
her suite with the courier to prepare the house in
Cairo where they were to winter.

She looked apathetically up at Treherne.
“Brascodemi told me he had seen you, at Alex-
andria; are you touring here?”
Treherne was too pre-occupied to notice theques-
tion. “I am come,” he said abruptly, “to ask a very
strange favour; can you spare one of your attend-
ants for a lady who has been taken very ill here?”
“Ill? Spare one of my attendants? What
do you mean? What a very strange request !
If she is a lady, I suppose she has her own at-
tendants; what does she want with mine? And
pray what is the matter with the lady? Is it
anything catching? I hope you have not had
the abominable selfishness to come here to me—
whom you know to be so careful and so afraid of
infection,—if you have been with anyone who
has anything catching? I really never could or
would forgive it—it would be too bad—thinking
so entirely of somebody else, and never consider-
ing me in the least ! Has she anything catching,
Montagu ? and if she has, why upon earth have
you gone near her? And why, above all, do you
come near me? Do answer, boy; and don’t
stand looking at me and Miss Parkes as if we
were beasts in the Zoological Gardens.”

Treherne did indeed stand looking first to-
wards one and then the other. Desperate
thoughts flitted through his mind; thoughts of
proposing to the humble companion to leave his
aunt, then and there—with a promise of three
times her present salary, and the bonus of kind
and civil words all the year round; fierce anger
against “that selfish Porpoise,” as he inwardly
called his irate aunt; sinking fears lest Beatrice,
meanwhile, might be growing worse. And with
all this, a certain desire to temporise and con-
ciliate, for the sick girl's sake.
The Marchioness broke silence. “Will you
answer, once for all, who is the lady; and is it
catching, Montagu?”
This time Treherne answered to the point, with
scarcely repressed impatience. “The lady's health
is all that requires the interference of strangers.
I don’t know whether the fever she has is catch-
ing or not. I fear she may be dying—she seems
so ill. I want a maid—one of your maids—only
for this one night, till assistance comes; and
want a doctor!”
The humble companion, who was chafing her
lady's fat ankles during the colloquy, looked up

doubtfully. Sorrow and pain—neglect and lonely
sickness—were part of her own life's experience.
Pity was in her drawn features. “I’m sure,” said
she, “if my lady pleases—.” She got no further:
the eyes of the Marchioness positively glared.
“Who gave you leave to speak? I’m sure you
are not so very quick and alert that you need look
to disposing of your leisure time ! Who, pray, is
to wait on me, while you dance attendance on
other people? You have my portable bath to get
out, my tea to make, and the dog to attend to.
And as to my maid, Montagu, you really are
much mistaken if you think—”
“La! milady, I shouldn’t goon no account to de-
mean myself, waiting upon—creatures !” said the
woman, with an angry flounce; and she looked with
defiant sauciness at Treherne. He tried (a task most
rare with him) to command himself. Beatrice was
perhaps dying: assistance must be had. He was
about to renew his petition at least for the
doctor's attendance, when, with a burst of anger,
the Marchioness stood up:
Erect the goddess rose !
like Diana in Horne's “Orion,” only not with the
same claims to chastity.

“Grant me patience: Montagu,” said she, “do
you persist in standing there, bringing, by your
carelessness, infection and disease among us all?

And with a running murmur of discontent,
like a brawling brook over stones, the Mar-
chioness resettled herself among her shawls and
cushions; and dismissing from her mind the im-
pertinent interruption of the dying girl's case
of danger, ruminated entirely on her own chances
of infection. -
Meanwhile Dr. Foljambe was even less atten-
tive than before; for Treherne, meeting that
gentleman, and finding a more compassionate
auditor in him than in the Marchioness, entered
into an eager discussion of Beatrice Brooke's
symptoms; and saw, with horror, while he
detailed them, the increasing gravity of counte-
nance of the young medical man. The reality
of his own vague half expectation that DEATH
might ensue, smote him as if the idea occurred
for the first time.
“Good God! you seem to think she really will
die,” said he.
“I do not say she will; but these cases are so
uncertain! Meanwhile let her be soothed and
encouraged; there is so much morbid dejection in
these attacks, re-acting on the patient's state.”
Treherne hesitated; muttered something; hesi-

circumstances attending their flight from Venice.

BEATRICE IS MARRIED.
“ARE you sleeping, Beatrice?” said Treherne, in
a low voice, as he entered the room after the
doctor's prescription had been given to her.
“No,-I am dying ! I hear you, but the words
seem all faded and distant. I see you, but every-
thing is confused. I remember, as if all my life
were so long ago—so long ago! Oh Montagu !”
resumed she, with a burst of renewed passion,
“what will become of me? My father my
father! If I could only say “husband” once, and
you could tell him I died your wife. Montagu !”
—and her look was one of such wild appeal, that
Treherne first shrank, and then with a burst of
passion, folded her in his arms;—“Would it be a
great sin to call me by that dear name to him,

hands before I die? He has suffered so much—
my poor father: He is so proud, so honourable.
Oh! God, have pity on me ! Thou, who knowest
all hearts, THOU knowest I meant no wrong.”
And this time, the appealing eyes looked, not
to Treherne, but with a desolate wildness upwards.
Upwards! beyond the blank ceiling that hid the
sky — beyond the world that hid God from her
thoughts. Then a faint stupor dulled all her
being, and she lay with her eyes wide open, and
that expression in them which thrilled Treherne's
heart with such inexpressible terror; that muddy
lustre, like the sunshine on pools full of dead
autumn leaves.
When she was again conscious, Treherne spoke
to her; he was standing by her bedside with
another gentleman, with some one in a dark
dress—with a clergyman. Beatrice gave a wild
cry of joy.
“Here is the chaplain of one of our consulates,
Beatrice, who has been good enough to consent to
a little delay in his journey, to make you my
wife; do you hear, darling?”
Beatrice's eyes moved quickly from side to side,
but she answered nothing.

“Oh, love of my heart! Oh, Beatrice! here is
help. Don’t die!”
Something like a smile quivered over the hot
dry lips of the poor girl. “No,” she said, “no,
Montagu. I won’t die, if I can live!”
“Do you think you will understand what this
gentleman—what the chaplain will read?”
“Yes. I am to be your wife; let him make
me your wife. I will not die till then.” She
folded her hands with anxious earnestness, and
immediately afterwards unlocked them; they
fell by her side.
“God help us both, and make me a pleasant
memory to Montagu, when I am gone!” she said:
and then turning to the chaplain, she added
faintly—“I think death must be very near, I feel
so much less confused. Marry us quickly: and be
sure that it is not such grief as it seems. I would
rather be his wife, though only to die in his arms,
than live for any destiny that could part us!”
The eyes of the English chaplain were bent on her
with the deepest compassion. His voice trembled,
the words faltered from his lips, as he read with
earnest gravity the brief ceremony appointed by
our Church, for that solemn union which death

only should have power to unlink! A deep sigh
of relief from Beatrice at the conclusion, was
echoed by both her companions.
Then she turned deadly faint; she caught
nervously at Treherne's sleeve. “Oh! Montagu,”
she said, “is this death? Is this indeed farewell?
Farewell, my darling! Farewell love, and fare-
well life ! Don't forget me!”
“And so saying, a deadly swoon seized her, and
she lay with her head on Treherne's arm, like a
lovely statue of marble.
He never moved his arm. He scarcely stirred
his bowed head from its bending as she sank to
that swooning sleep. He wrung the chaplain's
hand, as he noiselessly retreated from the apart-
ment; and sat and watched his dying love for
hours.
But when next Beatrice moved and woke, he
knew, and she felt, that somehow the plague-fever
was past; and that though she might die of weak-
ness, she would not die of the disease which had
smitten her down in the bloom of her youth so
suddenly.
Her eyes turned on him—sane, quiet, with a
sort of serene weakness in them. Her hand

pressed his feebly. She smiled, with a feeble
but conscious smile: “Husband,” at length she
whispered, “call me once ‘wife;’” and Treherne,
as he pressed his lips on the little hand that lay
within his own, said in a soft fond voice, “My
wife, my wife, my poor Beatrice, my very wife!”
And the great stars came out in their intense
southern lustre on the warm depths of that
eastern sky,–shining over the land of Egypt!
Over the desert tracks, and over the city walls;
over Christian churches and Turkish mosques;
over those scenes with all their blessed traditions
where the holiest of footsteps passed among the
olives of the garden, and climbed the hill of
Crucifixion; over the groups of travellers scat-
tered here and there, with weary camels and
merchant burdens; and over the strange rest
of that bridal night, where the shadow of death
was fellow-watcher till morning, with that young
enamoured man!

apartment might have brought her some feverish
infection. Every half-hour her weary humble
companion, her maid, and the scattered servants,
were roused into a group of half-sleepy half-
provoked slaves, with her exclamations and
a SSUlranceS.
“I am sure I have the plague! I feel that I
have got the plague ! Go and fetch Dr. Foljambe.
I am certain he either denies it out of folly, to
re-assure me, or else he don’t know the symptoms.
Give me the proper remedies for the plague ! I
suppose even if I haven’t it, they won't do me any
harm. Let my nephew, Mr. Treherne, be told,
if he attempts to come near me again, the Mar-
quis shall resent it. Burn some aromatic gum !

I’m too cold! That’s one of the symptoms; I

it, I will find a way to show my displeasure.
Give me remedies for the plague.”

hospitals,—at last Dr. Foljambe administered a
remedy for the plague the Marchioness herself
was becoming to the hot, weary, overworked
group of her various dependants,—by mixing
and presenting with a courteous bow, a tolerably
strong soporific draught.
And the stars, which were impartially lighting
all the emptiness and all the fulness of earth,
looked down on the building, in one of whose
most cushioned corners the empty head, cold
heart, and corpulent figure of that luxurious
aristocrat lay,–and found her buried in a pro-
found slumber.

CHAPTER XX.
A CALM AFTER THE STORM.
ON the fifth day Beatrice was out of danger,
though very weak; and the evasion of the only
member of Treherne's family then on the same
track, being rendered doubly easy by the Mar-
chioness's fear of such an encounter, and her
utter ignorance of who Treherne's companion
might be,—their journey back to Alexandria in
time for the very first steamer that afforded the
opportunity of getting to Marseilles, was accom-
plished without hindrance or event of any kind.
Beatrice, naturally healthy, lifted almost in-
stantly from the attack of fever that had pros-
trated her. Her gaiety and eagerness returned,
with the joyful consciousness that Treherne and
she were now united beyond the power of man to
divide them; and she was able to laugh (for the

wild weed merriment grew strong in her heart)
at his description of the Marchioness and her
terrors, when abiding under the same roof with
her, during that dreadful time.
As to the difficulties that surrounded their re-
turn, Treherne made very light of them. Before
leaving Venice, and when he imagined his voyage
with Beatrice would only extend to Trieste, he
had written a letter to Mrs. Myra Grey, com-
pounded of almost equal parts of entreaties,
reproaches, and promises; protesting against her
apparent renunciation of her charge, as calculated
to do Miss Brooke serious injury,—by forcing
disagreeable explanations with her father, as to
what had occurred abroad. And resolutely de-
claring that feeling responsible for the arrange-
ments he had made for her with Captain Brooke,
he would utterly refuse and protest against her
being delivered over to the Princess Gouglo-
koff; that he should, on the contrary, see her
safely placed with the Brettons, who had gone to
Trieste; feeling sure Dr. Bretton, from his con-
nection with the Lewellyns, would not demur a
moment to the arrangement. That he would
afterwards expect Mr. and Mrs. Grey to follow

the original plan agreed upon, and escort Miss
Brooke back to England.
That as to the idea of his marriage, they would
“talk of it two years hence,” when he became
legally of age; but that certainly, after the scene
which had taken place on the subject between him
and his uncle, it could not be very pleasant for
Miss Brooke to be detained as a sort of hostage
for his conduct, in a house where her presence
must be so unwelcome. That Miss Brooke herself
would not consent to it.
That, after seeing her to Trieste, he would
probably proceed to Vienna, to visit his old col-
leagues and friends; and, finally, that if the Greys
declined to accede to his wishes, he would hold no
further communication with them as long as he
lived. They might address their answer to the
poste restante at Trieste to be forwarded to
Vienna up to a certain time, after which he
should return by way of Trieste to Venice.
Fortune so far favoured Treherne in his rash
elopement, that it remained unknown. The Greys
wrote, - remonstrating, reasoning, appealing, and
quoting his uncle as supreme authority for what
had been done or proposed to be done; hoping that

when he “took time to consider,” he would see the
wisdom and decency of the arrangement; and as-
suring him that “real business connected with the
sale of lands” took Mr. Grey meanwhile from
Florence to Rome, where one of his principal clients
had appointed to meet him, glad of the oppor-
tunity of consultation afforded by his visit to the
continent.
Receiving no answer to these epistles (as how
should they, when Treherne was gone to Alexan-
dria), the Greys took for granted that the young
man's wrath was too great to allow of his dis-
cussing the matter in any other light than as he
chose it to be settled.
Manyperplexed consultations then took place be-
tween them how best to keep a “calm sough"
with all parties. The advantage which might
have accrued from the tranquil shifting of Bea-
trice from one chaperon to another, was no longer
possible. The threat of cutting the solicitor and
his wife for ever, made by this wilful scion of a
wilful stock, was a menace which he was quite
capable of carrying into execution; and after all
he was “the heir.”
They might, by refusing his request to re-escort

Beatrice to her friends, merely precipitate the
dreaded marriage which he expressed himself
willing to “talk of two years hence.” Much
might happen in two years. Meanwhile a great
deal of scandal and struggle would be avoided, if
they could reconvey this young lady to her friends,
and so wash their hands of her.
A copy of Treherne's valedictory epistle to Mrs.
Myra Grey was forwarded to Lord Caérlaverock,
who was relieved at finding the young rebel ap-
parently so much more reasonable than he had
feared when first that startling intelligence “la
colombe s'est envolée’’ was communicated by the
Gouglokoff. And at length, changing their tactics
with the change of circumstances,—it was decided
that the solicitor and his wife should agree to
resume their charge of Miss Brooke for the return
journey to England, Mr. Grey undertaking to
meet her on her return to Venice,—at the landing
of the steamer, on the one condition, that “after
the scene of family anxiety of which Mr. Treherne's
interest in this young lady had been the unhappy
cause,” he should by no means attempt to see her
or even to write to her while under their care.
Treherne got all the letters at one and the

same time, on his arrival at Trieste; he glanced im-
patiently over the remonstrances and reasonings of
an earlier date, read carefully through the “letter
of capitulation,” as he called the last, and tossed
it down with a scornful and satisfied smile.
“My own beautiful Beatrice, I shall accept
their one condition; you shall go back, as you
came, without any attempt at escort on my part |
I will be in London before you, waiting your ar-
rival. You will send a note to me at the Travellers
Club the moment you can do so without observa-
tion. We must be prudent, to avoid vexation and
discovery. After Mrs. Myra Grey's cool throwing
you over that evening at Venice, I do not suppose
that you will be on very intimate and conversable
terms. It is unnecessary to say, let nothing wring
our secret from you—a secret on which so much
depends.”
“With these people—impossible, dear Montagu.
But to my father, I trust the very day after we shall
meet in London you will accompany me to him,
and let him know what has occurred. It shall be a
secret from all the world except from my father
and Mariana.”
Treherne sighed restlessly; looking, not at

Beatrice, but at the heap of opened letters on the
table. He rose, and kissed her tenderly on the
forehead. “My own, we must think well, and
settle what to do when we meet. My future is
so tangled by that will; your father is so unlikely
to bear a marriage that is not to be owned; there
is so much that is perplexing and unfortunate;
oh! Beatrice, forgive me, and promise me to wait
till we mutually decide how this shall be told ;
there is something I wish to confide to you, be-
fore any of these explanations can take place—
something I dread, and yet long to say ——”
He paused; looked wistfully and absently again
at the letters; sighed; took a turn or two up and
down the room; sat down, and buried his face in
his hands.
Beatrice moved gently towards him. She bent
and pressed her lips fondly on the shining curls
of that bowed head. “Do you think I mean to
be a rebel wife so soon ?” she said, with a smile.
“Believe me, your will shall be my will; what
you decide shall satisfy me. I love you; I trust
you; I anchor every hope on earth in your heart
and its affection for me. I swear to wait what
you shall think our best time.”

He looked up; he folded her in his arms.
“My gentle fervent Beatrice” he said, “if ever
man loved woman, I love you. If I thought the
day could come when you would speak to me in
coldness, or anger, or alienation, I would shoot
myself this hour ! But I am a fool to talk so.
Here we are once more with the flaming sword of
“hurry’ driving us,”—and he laughed with a forced
vexed laugh,-“We are but just arrived, and for
the sake of every chance of future comfort we
must close with the offer of the Greys; get you
back to them to-morrow, and look to our meeting
in London.”
“And no more partings then, Montagu ! so
you need not speak so sadly.”
“‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”
Am I not parting with you now?”
“You will tell me I only half love you,-as you
did once before,—if I say to you that I can part

and the sunshine above promising the late autumn
calm that should tinge with golden glory the lions
of St. Mark,-did the look with which he answered
her farewell gaze of fondness, fade to such an ex-
pression of pain perplexity and gloomy thought?
Is love so small a thing in comparison of money,
Montagu Treherne, that the “tangling of the
future” of an old man's foolish will (a will that you
professed yourself so sure to be able to set aside)
could darken so fair a honeymoon with a cloud
from beneath which there can be no lifting?
Some such cloud there certainly was on the
young man's spirits; something beyond the dejec-
tion of parting temporarily with Beatrice—beau-

tiful and affectionate as she was, and enamoured
of her beauty, and anxious for her love, as he
professed himself to be. He saw her lovely eyes
—“haunting eyes”—all night long, while tra-
velling alone in the railway; between him
and the dark clear sky as he restlessly lifted
or lowered the heavy window of the carriage;
between him and the pages of the new sprightly
French novel on which he vainly endeavoured
to fix his attention; between him and the burly
Austrian general asleep in the opposite seat;
between him and all other objects, even till
the first streaks of daylight breaking in that
foreign sky, brought him the relief at last of
slumber !
And not once, in all the long night, did the pain
and perplexity under which he was suffering leave
his heart: but, steadily as the shadow marks the
waning time on a sundial, they crept ever onwards
through the bounded circle of his thoughts.
We know this feeling,-such of us as have
even a brief experience of life and its troubles,—
in the sense of some great anxiety, which fills us
with a wish to halt and to decide,—a vain longing
for some solemn pause which would help us with

a neutral hour; and the dark shadow will not
wait, but passes round.
We know the feeling,- some of us,— in the
sense of a great remorse; when the dial seems only
to reckon the time that has past since we might
have halted and did not; when we might have
decided for the better, but rashly took the worse.
And while the black shadow steals round on
our saddened hearts, the ominous words “Irrevo-
cable, irreparable – irreparable, irrevocable !”
seem to beat to and fro with a dull muffled sound
from the pendulum of the great clock of Time.

CHAPTER XXI.
A SECRET MARRIAGE.
To “keep a secret” among strangers and in-
different persons, who have no claim on our
confidence, or sympathy with our feelings, is the
easiest thing in the world. But to keep a secret,
however important to our own destiny or to
the destiny of others, from those with whom we
dwell in love, intimacy, and the bond of near and
dear connection, is the most restless of human
trials.
It is not the telling or withholding of a
certain piece of intelligence; still less is it the
asserting or denying that which remains unques-
tioned; a fact hidden in the recesses of our own
hearts. It is the perpetual snapping of the
thread of thought and speech; the trembling on a
sort of precipice of memory, where there used to be

a pleasant easy sunny path from our mind to the
minds of our loved ones.
Like the sudden land-slips that transform
some smiling hill-side into a rugged mass of
rocks, tearing asunder the calm homesteads,
each with its garden-plot and meadow ground,—
creating strange chasms of distance, where
there had been dear neighbourhood,—a sense
of danger, where there had been the careless
safety of custom,-and an abiding silence where
voice had so readily answered voice,—so does the
“keeping of our secret” mournfully disunite and
lay desolate the ground of fellowship on which we
formerly met.
Even where there is agreement among the
members of a united and loving family, “never
to mention” some particular subject; some
painful event; some error, perhaps, of one of its
members, exiled by sin; some unutterable wrong
which we would fain forgive; some wound whose
healing depends on the thin cicatrice never being
touched,—even so, how difficult it is to keep for
ever clear of that tabooed and dreaded topic |
How the minds of all seem to be continually
veering to it, as the mimic swans of the child's

toy veer helplessly to the magnet; until by some
uncomfortable spell we are driven or attracted
towards saying precisely what we should not,—
Striking th' electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound,
and sending pain from our own hearts to the
hearts nearest and dearest to us!
But if it is difficult to avoid certain topics, even
where there is agreement to avoid them, how much
more difficult must it be where there is, apparently,
free exchange of thought for thought; where
those who listen in smiling love, think they hear
all; and those who speak, have for ever to “fence
in” the consciousness of some past event or future
plan,—some outlaw's den of wild projects,—some
Rosamond's bower of disallowed delights,—or
some grey ruin haunted by dead hopes !
To these hiding-places of the soul, our own
words may at any moment yield up the infallible
clue: to these we may lead the footsteps we most
desire or are most bound to bar out. Let the
heart watch, – sad sentinel, weary of its post ||
forbidden to speak save to those who have the
answering watchword; forbidden to slumber lest
its sleep should betray; forbidden henceforth the

joys of unchallenged companionship, or the free-
dom of a spirit at peace with itself and all the
world.
Heavy is the weight of the armour worn in
such a service | Heaviest to hearts like Beatrice
Brooke's; to the frank, the impassioned, and the
young.
Of course, there are those to whom reserve
is natural and habitual; those who from their
earliest youth “stand on their guard,” as it were,
with their most intimate and closest ties. And
there are those who acquire that reserve in later
years; whose souls have cased themselves in a sort
of petrified covering from the chill droppings in
the cave of that stern Egeria, Worldly wisdom;
those whose veriest acmé of boast it is, that words
cannot startle them, nor fondness bewray them
into confiding that which they think it prudent not
to communicate, but that under all circumstances
of alarm, distress, or temptation, they can “keep
their countenance,” and “keep their secret.”
The secret Beatrice had to keep, was one which
was daily and hourly on the point of betrayal,
after her return to England and to the com-
panionship of her father and sister.

Vain was the satisfaction of Treherne in a
number of small circumstances that favoured
its concealment. That the Greys had not the
remotest notion that Beatrice had been to
Alexandria; imagining that time past at Trieste
with the Brettons, who were strangers to them,
and were still abroad. That the Marchioness was
equally ignorant of that great fact; her fear for
Self and Co. having prevented even the risk
(which in his despairing fear of Beatrice's death
he was willing to run) of her maid recognising
the beautiful girl on the improbable chance of
her having seen Miss Brooke on that single occa-
sion of the “soirée dansante.”
Vain was the comfort that Lord Caërlaverock
was not only unconscious of the act of overt rebel-
lion that had followed the “great scena,” as the
Gouglokoff termed it; but on the contrary, firmly
believed that Treherne had “thought better of
it,” and hesitated to sacrifice his future to a wild
fancy, —though he had insisted on the Greys
standing to their engagement and escorting his
“Bergére” home again: impressed with which
belief, the old diplomat rather chuckled over
his own temporising shrewdness, and wrote a

letter to Treherne, saying he accepted the chal-
lenge to “talk of his marriage two years hence,
when he was legally of age,” and he hoped the
conversation would be more gay than their Vene-
tian Council of Four.
Vain was the apparent certainty that unless, as
children say, they “told of themselves,” there was
time for deliberation, and power to keep their
marriage secret as long as they pleased; till he
was of age; till he had ascertained what he could do
with that absurd will of his grandfather's. Every
sentence Beatrice spoke was a nervous trouble to
her. Every look she gave to her father's kindly face
seemed to invite a reproach.
Every now and then she was seized with
unaccountable agitations. Her heart quailed,
her voice trembled, her cheek crimsoned, or
her eyes filled with sudden tears, from some
cause which was utterly inexplicable to her home-
friends. In talking eagerly to those who
were eager to hear, she was continually on
the eve of betraying herself by speaking of
Alexandria, of the desert, of that dreadful storm
in the Adriatic gulf; and describing things she
was not known ever to have seen. In speaking

of Treherne, her very wish to avoid the impres-
sion of too great an intimacy, led her into the
opposite extreme; and even simple Captain
Brooke and calm Mariana would fix their eyes on
her with a vexed and puzzled expression, which
redoubled her agitation; wondering what had
occurred between these two of doubt or quarrel,—
though but a lover's quarrel,—since at Tenby, and
up to the time when Beatrice left England, they
were such a light-hearted merry pair of friends!
A dawn of anxiety rose in simple Captain
Brooke's mind, lest the handsome young Welshman
should be “trifling with his girl's affections;” and
a sore struggling sensation choked at his heart,
when he thought that perhaps “what had hap-
pened lately” to himself might stand in his
child's way, by making Treherne's proud relations
unkind about her. He redoubled his tenderness
to Beatrice. Who could tell? Perhaps the poor
child had her vexations, and would not reveal
them for fear of fretting him. Something cer-
tainly was wrong; and she was not well, his
darling, his bright love, his pet of The Home.
He even ventured on a little gentle hint to
Mariana, to ascertain whether Beatrice was

“sorry about anything,” or had not been kindly
treated by the Greys, whom she scarcely ever
mentioned. He did not think her tour had done
her good: on the contrary, she seemed less well
than when she went.
But Mariana's gentle inquisition sped but ill.
Her innocent cross-questionings were productive
of startled looks, crimson blushes, and anxious
sighs, but of no satisfactory information as to
Beatrice's state of mind. Mariana came to nearly
the same conclusion as her father—that Beatrice
was in love with Treherne, and that either his
pride or the pride of his family caused some
hitch, some delay (for she could not think it
more) in the avowal of his intentions.
Beatrice's position meanwhile with her hus-
band was daily torture to her, though he
seemed more and more enamoured every time
they met. To have to meet him as if he were
only an acquaintance; to walk with him now
and then, as if she had no right to walk with
him,—making arrangements and appointments for
that purpose; to steal, at rare intervals, to his
house, in guilty secresy; to receive him as a mere
visitor at her own home; to know the major part

of his days and evenings spent with other people;
to sit reflecting on all this, while he was keeping
engagements as a bachelor in the society he was
accustomed to, fevered and saddened her.
She was comforted when she saw him : the
things that seemed so wild, aching, and dismal to
bear in his absence, took a more tranquil and rose-
coloured aspect in the sunshine of his presence; she
could smile at his gathering of instances of histori-
cal secret marriages and romances, and his assur-
ances, between kisses and smiles, that she was far
better off than deserted Arabella Seymour, and only
one degree worse off than Anne, Duchess of York,
Lord Clarendon's daughter, whose marriage was
suspected only by the increased respect with
which her own mother served her at dinner.
She could smile — while he was there to evoke
the smile; but when alone, she thought, “How
shall I ever bear this for two years, which it seems
so impossible to continue to bear even through
a few weeks?”
Once she spent an unendurable evening at the
opera, to which her father had pressed her to go
with the same friend whose ball she and Mariana
had once attended: a friend not in Treherne's

set. She sent a note to the Travellers, and to his
lodgings in Stratton Street, to give the number
of the box and apprise him that she was going.
It was her first “gaiety” since she returned to
England; and nothing but her father's sorrowful
and puzzled countenance, repeating over and over
again, “You, my love, who used to be so fond of
the opera; I thought it would do you good,”
would have induced her to accept the offer.
She went; and found herself in the tier above
the grand tier, almost immediately over the box
Lady Eudocia used to occupy, and, nearly opposite
the French Ambassador's, where, as on a former
occasion, Milly Nesdale was conversing with some
diplomatic notabilities. Treherne also was there
during part of the evening. It is true he did not
stay very long: he did not seem very gay or
conversable; he did not look much at the stage or
much round the house; but sat awhile playing
with Lady Nesdale's fan, and tapping it to the
music on the edge of the box. Beatrice watched
him: she felt hot and angry, though she guessed
he had not got her note, and did not know she was
there. . Presently Treherne looked round the
house with his opera-glass: but he saw nothing

apparently to interest him. He laid the glass
down, leaned back, half yawned, and resumed the
fan. Lady Nesdale took it from him with a
rather pettish impatience; indeed she almost
snatched it from his hand, and spoke to him
apparently with some ill-humour. He answered
crossly: that Beatrice was sure of; she knew the
expressions of his countenance. Then he sat in
silence, looking vaguely round the house. Lady
Nesdale again spoke to him—something a little
sneering, Beatrice thought, for he looked angry,
and rose almost immediately, tossing back his
hair, as he did when he was “saucy and scornful,”
as his cousins termed it, and holding out his hand
as if to wish Lady Nesdale good night. She did
not take his hand. How dare she refuse it?
How dare she take it? She only shrugged her
slender shoulders, and bit the top of her fan, and
looked half round as he left the box. Then she
talked and laughed with two gentlemen who
remained: then for a while whenever the door
opened she looked round, as though she expected
some one—expected him to return, Beatrice
thought: then at last she ceased to look
round; and over that otherwise attractive face

there came so evil an expression, that Beatrice
dropped her glass as if she had seen a bad
vision: something in it reminded her of Mrs.
Myra Grey—but worse.
For ten minutes or more after Treherme had
quitted that box, Beatrice's heart beat quick, for
she thought perhaps he had seen her, and was
coming round; but the evening past, and he did
not reappear.
Scarcely could she speak of it next day without
tears, when they met. That vision of being
nothing to him—she that was his wife—vowed to
him for ever!
Treherne was a little sombre and impatient.
“It is precisely because I was thinking so much
of you, Beatrice, that I did not see you! if I had
been making that staring tour of inspection
through my glass, which used to amuse me before
I saw the face that makes one think all other
beauty imperfect, I should have picked you out
in your eyrie, and come to you fast enough; but
when I cannot see you, it seems to me there is
nothing left to look at anywhere. I did not stay.
The woman in whose box I was, tormented me
with persiflage about my low spirits, and I went
to the club.”

“Yes—Lady Nesdale—she looked wery cross
after you were gone. Do you—do you see her
often now * *
“Who has been talking to you about Lady
Nesdale’” said Treherne, sharply.
“The sister of Mr. Wollingham said some-
thing about her—said that you admired her—
one night when I was in Lady Eudocia's box.”
“She is a gossiping idiot.”
Nothing more was said; and, but for Treherne's
tone and manner, perhaps Beatrice would have
thought little. But the sudden sharpness—the
inquiring look—the “Who has been talking to
you about Lady Nesdale P”—fell on her heart like
the drifting of sleet and snow.

CHAPTER XXII.
THE DREADFUL DAY.
THERE are days in some lives which are so full of
pain, that no term of after-years, no joy or peace
of after-granting, can enable us to think of them
without a shudder, even to the last hour of ex-
istence. Such a day came to Beatrice.
It began brightly—more brightly than usual
days; for midshipman Owen came home from
sea, reported to the Admiralty for most gallant
daring and presence of mind, by which he had
saved the lives of eight seamen. Gladdening
the troubled home with his bounding step and
sunburnt smile and sparkling eyes, and the giv-
ing and receiving of a thousand welcomes,—and
talking as fast and eagerly as if (as indeed was
the fact) he had to compress into a day or two all
he had to communicate, and so be off again on

the tossing waves, his ship having already her
sailing orders. Sitting with his arm round that
dear father's neck who had suffered such anxiety
since he saw him last—with the old joyous laugh,
and the frank daring spirit, and the boyish fer-
vency of love—as on the sands of Tenby when
they were keeping his birthday—when first they
saw Treherne. -
And the Lewellyns were in London for a
couple of days; passing on with Sir Bertie's dying
brother, to get by slow degrees to the south;
but sparing time from those busy days to visit the
Brooke family, to whom in all these past weeks
and months Lady Eudocia had not vouchsafed
further notice.
Sparing time, even at the risk of shorten-
ing the visits Lady Diana had to pay to both
her haughty sisters: to the Marchioness, who
had glittered and paraded through the London
season so covered with “recollections of the Holy
Land” in the form of embroidered scarfs,
amber rosaries, and uncut rubies, that she re-
sembled a richly-loaded stall in a Constantinople
bazaar:—and to the fierce mother of gentle Helen
Wollingham and the four other golden-haired

disappointments, who had sent before daybreak,
the morning after Sir Bertie's arrival, to impress
on him the necessity of visiting Helen. For Helen
had “knocked up" in the middle of her London
season, and now spent her evenings lying on
the sofa, having books read to her (her eyes being
weak and her head easily tired) which task Mr.
Maurice Lewellyn had been kind enough very
often to perform.
She said nothing of Beatrice; and when Sir
Bertie, in pursuance of the summons, visited
the beautiful invalid, he asked if she had seen
much of her Tenby friend. Helen only shook
her head sadly; and Lady Eudocia indulged in
some haughty mutterings about “the extreme
indiscretion” of Beatrice's conduct—walking all
over the town without a servant—and the “alto-
gether discreditable” position of Captain Brooke's
affairs.
Sir Bertie “spoke up,” as the poor people
call it, for his old friend Captain Brooke. He
told Lady Eudocia he did not believe a more
honourable man existed; that as to his affairs,
they were likely to be settled tolerably well;
that he himself had bought the little property

of The Home, and trusted to regain his old
neighbour if only as his tenant. That young
Owen had greatly distinguished himself by his
courageous conduct in the wreck of the ship
“Enterprise”—had saved the lives of eight of
the crew, and shown a gallantry worthy of the
race he came of. That as to Beatrice, he
understood she had been abroad with the Greys;
but thought the Wollinghams might have seen
something of her since her return.
Sir Bertie left the house arm-in-arm with his
son, and spoke to him of Beatrice; but Maurice
did not seem to know much about her. He said
Lady Eudocia's caprice and haughtiness had pre-
vented any further companionship between the
girls; and he thought Beatrice altered for the worse,
both in looks and spirits,—“so that Helen Wol-
lingham had the less loss; ” which appeared the
important point in his eyes.
Lady Diana Lewellyn was waiting luncheon for
them, when they came in, and she looked up with
a more anxious seriousness than generally brooded
on her pleasant countenance.
“Bertie,” she said, “I am just come from
seeing the Brookes. I congratulated them about

and blushed like a harvest-maiden; my heart
yearned to him; the simplicity of a child, and
the bravery and good sense of a grown man was
in all he said. He will be a great credit to them.
But Beatrice” (and she shook her head sorrow-
fully), “I never saw a girl so altered, either in
looks or spirits—so nervous that I thought she
would have fainted when we first met—and so
sallow and languid. Her father is waiting most
anxiously to see you, and see what you think
about her. She persisted she was perfectly well,
but it is no such thing; and I give you my word,
he seemed to care more for his chance of having
your opinion about Beatrice, than about the news
that you were the purchaser of The Home, though
he was a good deal shaken, poor soul, when I told
him that, and that we hoped to meet again this
autumn. So you are to go, you dear Esculapius,
and make everybody well and happy again; and
get just such a hurried scrap of luncheon as I have
often seen you do before you were such a grandee,
and had half forsaken your profession: when
people sent for you every minute of the day and
night, as if you could live without food and with-
out sleep.”

And Dumpty leaned her white matronly hand
on Esculapius's shoulder and kissed his grand in-
tellectual forehead (with astonishing familiarity,
considering the rather severe countenance of that
eminent physician), and helped him to cutlets and
mashed potatoes, and a glass of wine, with a glad
nimbleness that might have done credit to that
serviceable domestic fairy of Scotch tradition, “the
Brownie; ”
after which Esculapius took his hat
and cane and departed to see the Brookes.
It was all joy at first; joy and the triumph of
giving joy; a hearty clinging grasp of the hand
from the old officer,-with his redeemed chances of
life and troubles got over, though at heavy sacrifice;
smiles and blushes from the glad sunburnt young
face which Dumpty’s kind heart had “yearned to;”
the “middy” who stood there so modest in his
burst of boyish fame, perhaps to take rank some
day among England's naval heroes. Joy in the
glistening thankfulness of Mariana's star-like eyes,
as she stretched out both her hands to welcome
the loyal friend, the wise counsellor, the restorer
of home days. -
But Beatrice, bright Beatrice, your share of joy;
why is it so disturbed, so fearful, so shrinking?

Why, when the gay greeting and the earnest
congratulations about Owen, — the giving up of
lease-papers for future explanation,—and the
tender grave talk with Mariana are all ended,
—and Captain Brooke rises to withdraw with
his other children, and says with a nervous smile,
“Now you must see what ails my pet of The
Home, that we may have nothing left to be
anxious about:” – why does she fly after him ex-
claiming so eagerly, “Nothing ails me, father,
nothing—nothing!” and lean panting against the
door he closed, looking wildly at Sir Bertie
Lewellyn, with half-defiance and half-despair in
her lovely startled eyes?
Is the grave physician called upon “to minister
to a mind diseased?” Has he some magic scalpel
which can dissect the human heart, and learn
why it beats so fast with terror among protecting
friends? Is he an adverse counsel come to cross-
examine her and compel her to bear witness even
against herself? -
Alas! for Beatrice.
The questioning is over. The brief, grave,
(increasingly grave) questioning : the hurried,
contradictory, downcast, and vainly-false replies.

There is silence; deep silence; no more words.
You can hear the faint breathing of Beatrice, and
the booming of a bee that has found its way in to
visit the white roses Lady Diana brought an hour
ago. You can hear the tick of the French clock
as it creeps to the stroke of four and strikes
immediately afterwards, with a gush of trivial
merry little bells. And lastly, you can hear —
and it makes Beatrice start as if it were a loud
sentence of condemnation—a sigh, deep and sad,
the sigh of a good man heartily sorry for his"
neighbour's grief,-from Captain Brooke's true
friend, Sir Bertie Lewellyn.
He draws nearer to Beatrice; he speaks in an
undertone; he does not offer her a chair, though
she seems faint and trembles. He only says these
words: “Unhappy girl, have you thought at all
what to do under these miserable circumstances?
What plans have you made?

strangers? Beatrice Brooke, I charge you, by

He stops; he watches that abashed girl. But
Beatrice is not a girl. She is a woman; a wo-
man and a WIFE ; a wife about to become a
MOTHER. She lifts her eyes and answers; her
voice is husky and low, but there is a passionate
authoritativeness in the tone in which she says:
“I charge you not to meddle between my father
and me; not for the sake of my own destiny, but
for those to whom I am bound; those who have my
solemn promise ! There is nothing to tell my
father: nothing to tell anyone. I have no sin to
reproach myself with.”
Silence again. Silence that has a sense of
stifling in it.
Sir Bertie breaks it. “Are you married?
Believe me, whatever be the circumstances—how-
ever unsatisfactory your choice—even if that
choice were beneath you—”
No; he sees it is not that: the proud lip, the
scornful shake of the head, the quivering lashes
over the downcast eyes, they answer him, but not
the voice. Yet he did not ask to whom, but only,
“Are you married?”

How could she tell him she was married ? Tell

she so betray her promises to her child's father?
The physician watches her still; he sees the
change to tenderness in that expressive face — he
hopes; he does not know her thoughts. He
speaks to her again; very gently, very softly.
Mothers, in whose houses he has made his visits,

child. - -
“Beatrice,” the sweet grave voice says, “I have

on them, weeping bitterly. A minute more,
he thinks, and she will own all — this young girl,
this girl of seventeen
But hearts of seventeen are strong when the
master-passion is in them, and the master-passion
of Beatrice's heart was love for Treherne. She
recovered a certain degree of calm. She thanked
Sir Bertie Lewellyn, but said it was impossible for
her, under any circumstances, to leave England
with him and Lady Diana. She protested once
more her innocence, and declared that her daily
trial was the intense desire she had to confide to
her father the circumstances in which she was
involved; but that she could not, “till she
obtained leave.”

“The sooner you obtain that leave the better,
Beatrice,” was the answer of the physician; and
his manner froze again, with something of a
sterner sadness. “I will not see your father now;
I could not Give him this note for me,—and if,
by Heaven's merciful interposition, you should be
led to think differently in this night's coming
hours, send for me, or send for my wife – be it
midnight or day-dawn –– and we will come. Oh,
child ! say your prayers with a careful heart this
night if ever you did so,-and God hear you for
Christ's sake, -for if you step wrong in this dark
hour, you step over a precipice of ruin.”
He was gone ! His note to Captain Brooke only
said that he had prescribed for Beatrice, and
trusted she would be better; that he was
obliged to hurry away, and hoped to see the
Brookes again the next day before starting. If
not, God bless them till they met in Wales.
That was all. Beatrice's secret was still in her
own keeping. For how long?
That very evening saw the vain barrier broken
down, and the fear of the morning sealed in
gloom. Captain Brooke had been sad and rest-
less since he received Sir Stephen's note. It was

not like that kindly physician to go away with-
out one word, however hurried, to comfort an
anxious heart. Was it that he could not comfort
him about Beatrice's health ? Could it be that
she was worse than they had supposed ? Dying,
perhaps, of decline, like her mother; she had grown
so like her mother now she was so pale.
The poor officer watched her with eyes aghastand
full of varying terrors, and the more he watched
her, the more agitated Beatrice became. Then he
tried to change his manner, and appear gay and
satisfied about her health, not to frighten her; and
this tender attempt made Beatrice, already shaken
by weeping, scarcely refrain from tears. Then Mr.
Grey came to read over the lease papers from Sir
Bertie Lewellyn, and Captain Brooke conversed
with him, after that was over, about his stay in
Italy, and the value of land round Florence and
Rome, and the modes of cultivation there.
Mr. Grey mentioned incidentally, that Dr. Bret-
ton had been on the point of making, as he con-
sidered, a very foolish bargain, but that “luckily”
an illness, a very bad fit of the gout, had prevented
his attending to business. His daughters had
been much alarmed about him, as Miss Beatrice

probably had told Captain Brooke, for it was
while she was staying with them that his illness
occurred.
Beatrice felt her ears throb with the hot
dizzy, blood rushing to her head; she said
falteringly—“No, he was pretty well when I saw
them.” She hoped the expression “staying with
them” had escaped her father. But when she
looked up from her work, both her father and Mr.
Grey were looking at her—the one with an ex-
pression of puzzled sorrow, the other with the
keenest scrutiny. She felt faint, and turned ashy
pale. The conversation changed. They spoke
of the railways which even slothful Naples was
beginning to establish; of the ease and rapidity
with which journeys were made in these modern
days; of the wonderful engineering of the Genoese
railroad, and the Semmerung Pass in Austria.
“Yes, the Austrian roads are wonderful,” Mr. Grey
said, “and so are their steamers. The day I was
waiting Miss Brooke's arrival from Trieste, I was
extremely struck by the speed with which Lloyds’
steamer cut her way through the water, and the
excellent steering she received.”
He said it on purpose; Beatrice was sure he

said it on purpose. She looked at him with an
imploring glance: it was worse than vain. He
showed his consciousness of it by a half contemp-
tuous curl of the lip, and instantly added:—“That
was the time I alluded to, when Dr. Bretton was
so ill; when Miss Beatrice was staying at Trieste
with the Brettoms.”
Did she ever love her father with the same
yearning love as when she heard him faintly
answer, “Yes; ” and then clearing his throat, and
looking Mr. Grey timidly in the face, begin to
make some observation about our progress in steam
machinery, -with that vague smile which people
put on, who are suffering from some sharp inward
vexation.
No one was deceived. Beatrice felt that
her father was, with chivalrous tenderness, pro-
tecting her from some attempt to show her up even
to himself. The experienced solicitor saw that
for some cause or other Captain Brooke had been
kept entirely in the dark as to his daughter's visit
to Trieste, and he instantly doubted whether she
had been to the Brettons at all. If not, where?
If not with them, with whom ? It was not a
small thing to the solicitor, what other arrange-

ments Treherne had made if he had not placed
Miss Brooke with these friends. His mind ranged
with natural quickness, and professional skill,
over the minutest circumstances which surrounded
what he felt had been A LIE; and he would, per-
haps, have dug further round that evil plant to
find its very roots, but that Captain Brooke availed
himself of the pause in the conversation cour-
teously to end it, saying, “I am a good deal
fatigued, Mr. Grey, and my girl is not very well,
so, perhaps, you will have some warm wine and
water, and say good-night.”
But after he was gone, Captain Brooke turned
towards his daughter and said, “Something has
happened abroad, my Beatrice, which I am not to
know. Something vexatious to you, which your
old father is not to be told; ” and he looked as if
he thought she would now tell it.
Who could bear it? Who could bear the plain-
tive kindly tone? the frank anxious gaze? the
conviction of the pain that was busy in that
unselfish heart?
The tears trembled in Beatrice's eyes; the
words trembled on her lips; the vision floated
through her mind of falling at his feet and owning

all; and them the vision of bringing Montagu
there, to tell him all,—to-morrow.
To-morrow !
Slowly and with effort Captain Brooke withdrew
the pitiful asking glance from his young daughter's
face. Again the horrid thought passed through his
mind that perhaps she had been very ill; perhaps
she had broken a blood-vessel, like her mother,
and did not wish him to know it. She did look
so very unwell, and somehow less carefully and
prettily dressed, less upright and active. He
covered his face with his hands.
“Never mind, love,” he said; “I’m sorry the
conversation troubled you. Reach me a gazetteer,
I want to see what sort of distance those Austrian
fellows would have to cut through for their
Semmerung Pass.”
Beatrice looked up at the shelf where the
dictionaries and gazetteers were placed—it was
a little beyond her reach; she put a footstool in
front of the book-case, and stretched her arm
upwards, hesitating which was the volume. Owen
looked up and rose to help her: he laughed.
“Ah! Beatrice,” he said, “you would not beat
me at a race now; you that were once so nimble!

You are grown fat, and pale, and lazy, and quite
an old lady.”
While he was yet speaking, Beatrice felt a
great dizziness; her arm dropped by her side; her
eyes swam; but in all the dizziness and swimming,
she was somehow conscious, as in a dreadful
dream, of the expression of her father's face, who
had also risen and stood as it were trans-
fixed, gazing at her; he stretched his tremb-
ling hand; he was pointing at her l—turning to
Mariana and pointing. As he did so, a cry es-
caped him. There is a cry given by those who
are suddenly stabbed: neither a shriek nor a
groan, but a combination of shriek and groan
stifled and stopped. That was the cry that Bea-
trice heard—the cry from a man's heart, stabbed
by a terrible conviction. She dropped from
where she stood, like a shot bird; she fell crouch-
ing at his feet; she flung her arms wildly round
his knees, and she gasped out—“I am married,
father. I am married, but it was not to be
owned !”
He thrust her from him; his beautiful Beatrice;
his Pet of The Home. He thrust her from him ;
and stood there, stern and staring, (he whom they

had never seen stern ) while Mariana's large
serene eyes dilated with pitying wonder, and the
startled boy vainly flung himself across his father's
breast and called the dear name loudly, as if to
call him back to the real, from some fearful unreal
world he was contemplating with that fixed
dreadful gaze.
“Father, father, what do you think you see?”
The father saw the spectre that can blight the
happiest hearth: the dark shadow—SHAME.

“A CHILD of mine married, and not owned ”
These were the first words he spoke; and they
were glad he spoke, though they were uttered so
fiercely, with set teeth, and clenched hands.
“Married—but not owned. WHO IS THE MAN ?”
He struck that question out as though he had
struck it on an anvil. And his children saw then
that miracle we sometimes behold, of youth
brightening over an old and faded face; when, as
by some strange gleam, we perceive what that
face was, and must have been, in its glory! The
brave open brow flushed through the full tingling
veins; the cheek kindled; the eye flashed fire;
for a moment you saw what he had been: you

comrade's helpless hour, amid the roar of the
battle, and the hail of red-hot shot.
Who is the man? Where is this enemy of
peace? give up his name to the Avenger!
It was but for a moment. The glory faded, like
the stormlight off a hill. The strength and
brightness vanished, you knew not where, and a
pale, powerless, broken-hearted old man stood
before them, who, stretching his arms vaguely
towards Mariana, sank down in his seat again
with a querulous burst of tears. “Oh God!
more shame –worse shame!” he said.
Beatrice crept towards him: the sweet welcome
voice he loved so—where was it? Was it hers,
that hoarse whisper from the feverish lips that
came so near his cheek, yet dared not kiss him?
“Be patient with me, father; I will be no
shame to you; I will be no grief to you. I am
married. I love him. He loves me. All will be
right, dear father, if you will but take patience with
me!
To-morrow, he shall come and explain why,
even to you, and sore against my will, and only
for a time, our marriage was to be kept secret.”
“For what time, Beatrice?”
“Two years; scarcely two years; less, now.”

“Who is your husband? I guess. I know
who has done this.”
“Father, give me till to-morrow,-only till
to-morrow !”
“Beatrice, if all is true, and you regret to
have hidden (alas! how skillfully) from a father
who so dearly loved his child, the most im-
portant step of your life,—hear me now. If
your husband comes here and claims you openly
to-morrow; and gives me any shadow of reason,
which, backed by youth and rashness, may seem
to excuse what has occurred, I will strive to
forgive what I never can forget, in his theft of
you! When, or how, he stole the daughter of an
imprisoned man, I have yet to learn,—and you
will tell me nothing.”
“He will; he will, dear father,- only wait
till to-morrow. I promised him so solemnly.
Give me only till to-morrow.”
“If, on the other hand, he does not make that
poor amends,—I hold you bound, until the time
expires which you say is to end this disgraceful
position, not to see him. You must live with us
in seclusion and widowhood, till he chooses
honourably to own you as his wife.”

“Oh, Beatrice, yes! with us — with us – safe
with us,” murmured Mariana, as she drew her
closer to her bosom. “Safe with us, as in the old
quiet days: safe in The Home, and wait there.”
The quiet days! Alas! could they return?
Can the river roll back to its source?
Could the peace of girlhood come again? Even
mow, while they spoke, she yearned for it; yearned
to be out of her trouble, in her father's kindly arms;
yearned to see once more on Mariana's face, that
sweet and placid smile,—the smile of an approving
angel, of a canonised saint,-instead of that look of
distress and wonder. But the child's heart was at
war with the woman's. Give her only till to-morrow!
Reader, have you ever loved,—untowardly,

scolding, or imploring, of some flow of sentences
from human lips, addressed to you; intended to
sway you, and alter the course and current of that
love; and have you, through all that louder
sounding of syllables, heard as it were an under-
tone (like the chorded accompaniment in music)
of some dearer voice; felt the warm flickering

over your soul of a smile for whose sake you
would die; seen, as in a vision, the light on the
beloved forehead, the love-look from the welcome
eyes, and felt the pressure of that hand which is
the link between you and happiness—which to
surrender, never to clasp again, would be simply
the blank and bitterness of death?
Have you listened so, and heard nothing,-
though you knew you ought to hear; though you
strove to bow your heart and calm your thoughts, and
strain your wandering mind, from the oppressive
knowledge that those who were speaking thus, did
it from deep conviction,— did it “for your good,”
—had perhaps some holy undeniable right to be
heard, and a claim to your reverential attention?
And have you, so knowing, so thinking, and so
striving, nevertheless felt, -with a sort of pas-
sionate despair, –that, stronger than all reasoning,
reverence, or conviction, was the spell that
bound you to—

wooing words, and the “ach seine kuss” of earthly
passion, overbore her, even while reproaching
herself for the feeling, and admitting the right to
reproach her or warn her. Often such inter-
ference is mere tyranny, or mere worldly schem-
ing; but oftener far, it is the rescue of watch-
ful affection, to those we perceive drifting to
the whirlpool. We would save them. And
oh ! the wonderful power to aid or prevent, that
seems to lie at such times in the narrow compass
of one human heart. Seems, for it is not so.
Very rarely so; God has given to no human
being full power to pilot another through the
storms of life. “By your own deeds ye shall
stand or fall.” Vain is intimate acquaintance,
deep love, accustomed authority, superiority of
intellect, wisdom of age. Something of rebellion
lurks in the heart of the most submissive, some-
thing of mystery in the hearts of the most prosaic.
“The heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a
stranger intermeddleth not with its joy.” And
until the sentence shall be reversed, which says —
Not even the tenderest heart, and next our own,
Knows half the reasons why we smile or sigh,
So it must ever be.

Beatrice listened with tearful reverence to
her father's words at this evil time. She
knew that all was true, or would be true in
other cases, which he proceeded to say so mourn-
fully,–of the unfair and disgraceful position which
such a marriage entailed; of the selfish rashness
of the man who thus seized love as a greedy prey,
instead of waiting for a betrothed bride: of the
inexcusable duplicity which was imposed on her
by the unholy promise she had given him. She
knew it was true, or would be true in other cases,
that the bond of wedlock was one to be more
piously and patiently considered, if they were to
expect God's blessing upon it. But in this one
especial case? If her father knew all,—when he
should know all? Give her only till to-morrow !
The voice of her father in blame of him she
loved with such a blind, infatuated passion — the
voice of Mariana, from time to time, in brief
sweet sentences of comfort or petition — these
went on ; and her slender fingers were twined in
her sister's, and her weary head leaned on her
sister's shoulder, while through all came vivid
recollections of the moonlight at Venice, the ill-
ness at that desert station, the strange tangling

will, the jesting of Treherne about the stories of
unhappy Arabella Stuart and the Duchess of
York, the excuses – his excuses, and her own,
and the hope that “to-morrow" would satisfy
her father.
But above all, and through all, and over all,
the dread of being parted from Treherne; the
dread of leaving this idol, for the life pictured
to her of widowhood and seclusion, for two
lonely years.
To leave him to be utterly away from him—
she that fevered over the annoyance of not
living in the same house with him; of not seeing
him every spare hour of the day; of not
having the full measure and joy of home do-
mestic life under her new domestic bond Not
to see him at all / to leave him to his London
life of business and temptation; to leave him to
Milly Nesdale ! to her smeers at his low spirits! to
her comforting if he should be sad.
HER comforting !
Beatrice gave such a start as this thought
crossed her, her soft eyes looked so wildly from
her father to her sister, that the latter said,
tenderly; “Oh ! my dear, are you in pain?”

And her father abruptly added, “Rest—rest, my
dear; she needs rest. We all need rest. God
send it!” and left the apartment.
He said no more: he never turned his head as
he left the room; there was no “good-night”
among them. It was the first time in all those
hitherto loving happy lives, they had parted so.
“My Beatrice! my Beatrice my dear dear
sister!” broke from the young midshipman, as he
threw his arms round her, and mingled his sobs
with hers. The fearless heart that dared the storm,
and whose courage had saved eight lives, melted,
as such hearts always do; and the three young
creatures grieved together; and then spoke eager
words of loving comfort, and built up at last,
mid smiles and tears, a castle in the air, whose
topmost tower was bright even to dazzling, in the
sunshine of To-MORROW. -

To-MoRRow ! But Beatrice could not wait for the
to-morrow. Weary and beat and ill as she was,
that child of impulse and passion no sooner found
herself in the tranquillity of her own room, than
the hours that intervened between her and the
decision of her fate seemed to stretch to an
etermity.
She opened the window and leaned against
it; but the withering mignonette brought no
freshness, and the racket of all the night
whirlings and wheelings of London beat on her
brain like an echo of the turmoil of thought
already there. She turned from the window and
sank on her knees in prayer — in earnest prayer,

for direction, for forgiveness, for grace. But calm
was lost; action, action only, could tranquillise
that restless mind. There are moods in which
such natures feel that to be passive would send
them mad! The night – those ten or twelve lazy
careless hours — what was it to wait one night?
Yet to her it seemed a year – a lifetime, — to
wait till morning. Treherne might be out before
he got any note she sent; he might not know of
what importance it was that he should come; for
how could she explain why she sent for him? She
must see him Now. If she could see him, if only
for ten minutes,—then she could rest, —perhaps
sleep; and she passed her hand feverishly over
her aching brow. She must see him.
She stole softly to her brother's room: “Are
you in bed, Owen ?”
“Oh no, my dearest; I am not even undressed.
I was sitting still thinking of you!”
“Owen, if you ever loved me, do not reason
with me at all about the favour I am going to ask
you. I want to go out. It is not really very late;
not very late for London; not more than eleven;
not later than half the people are setting out for
balls. Do not disturb my father. You must guess

who it is I want to see. Dear, I am too miserable
to wait my opportunity of seeing him to-morrow,
after what has passed to-night with my father. The
servant is in bed; go softly down and get a cab
round to the door, and sit up for me in the dining-
room. No one will see, no one will know; and
to-morrow he will come here, and all the distress,
please God, will be over.”
The young midshipman sighed, but departed on
his commission without answering a word. He
handed Beatrice into the cab, and held her hand
for one detaining moment: “May I not even
accompany you? Oh, Beatrice' are you going
alone 2 ”
“To-morrow, Owen, you will be both brothers
acknowledged: to-morrow !”
She tried to smile, and the boy stood wistfully
looking after her; he heard her tell the driver to
go to “Stratton Street,” and went in to wait.
Beatrice also had to wait. She had reached the
number in the street where Treherne had apart-
ments before she recollected that she would have
to knock and ring like any other visitor to obtain
admittance. She had always been accompanied
by Treherne himself when she went there. The

sleepy maid-servant who answered the ring, asked
who she desired to see, and told her Mr. Treherne
was not yet returned from dining out. “Could I
—could I wait in the drawing-room?”
“Certainly, Miss.”
It was near two o'clock when Beatrice at last
heard Treherne come in. He had his latch-key,
and passed up-stairs without giving time for the
servant to have announced her. Beatrice's agita-
tion was redoubled by hearing some second person,
some gentleman, also entering with Treherne. She
heard him say, “Shall I give you a cigar?” She
moved rapidly across the room, thinking to escape
into the inner apartment; but the young men
were more rapid still, and as the door opened she
stood face to face with Treherne and Maurice
Lewellyn ! The amazement of the latter was so
great that he did not attempt to speak. Beatrice
also trembled; she was without her bonnet, which
she had taken off on first coming in, in the vain
hope to cool her aching head. Treherne was ex-
cessively discomposed, but he instantly addressed
her: “Is your father—is Captain Brooke ill, or in
danger? Has any misfortune happened? What

can I do for you? I am sorry I was not here
earlier.”
But this assumption of being merely “a family
friend,” however gracefully executed, failed to
restore composure to either of his companions.
Beatrice only answered faintly, “Yes, something
has occurred—I wished to consult you—my
father is not exactly ill —;” she stopped, looking
helplessly at Treherne's face; and Maurice
Lewellyn, in an agitated voice, said, “I will wish
you good-night, Montagu.” He seemed to make
an effort to say something also to Beatrice, but
failed, and abruptly departed.
“Oh, my Beatrice, how mad! how foolish !
and how ill you look! What in the name of
Heaven ails you? What has happened?”
She told him all. All-–and that she had
undertaken for him that he would declare their
marriage and his reasons for concealing it, to her
father the next day.
“Beatrice! you have ruined us both; if you had
had patience for the future yet but a little while !
What you ask is impossible."
“I tell you, Montagu, I have suffered such
torture, concealing this from my father, that

dreadful as to-day has been, it is a relief to me to
have told him Even now I have not named you;
but he cannot doubt whose name I bear. You
cannot tell (my own dear heart, you were an
orphan so soon ) you cannot tell what it is to have
concealments from these dear and near ties.”
“There was LOVE in Eden before there were
other ties,” said Treherne, wildly; “and if you
loved me, under all our difficulties, you would
think of nothing but that love! It should suffice
you though all others failed you upon earth. It
should suffice you though no tie but that love held
us together. As to parting us—but you will not
leave me—you cannot leave me.”
“Does my father wish us parted? Does he ask
so hard a thing? Only that you should come to
him; explain to him; he will forgive; he will
keep our secret.”
“He asks—what is impossible!”
Beatrice rose from her seat; she trembled from
head to foot; she leaned one hand on the back of
her chair as if to steady her from falling as she
made one step towards Treherne,—and then she
said passionately, almost fiercely, “I must be owned
—I WILL be owned as your wife—to my father!”

She sank back into the seat she had occupied,
and both looked silently at each other. Then
Beatrice said faintly, with closed eyes and pallid
lips, “Oh ! forgive my way of saying it! I have
passed such a miserable maddening day.”
All that caresses and gentle words could do to
soothe her was done by him to whom she owed that
day of trial; and then he besought her (as she had
besought her father) to “give him till to-morrow”
to consider what to say; he begged her to come
there at midday on the morrow, and to let him
reconduct her now to her own home.
The door of home opened swiftly and softly, as
the cab turned into the street, for the young
brother was waiting—watching and listening till
dawn, as though he kept the night-watch on the
deck of his ship. He saw his pale exhausted
sister assisted down by Montagu Treherne, who
waited till the house door was closed and drove
awayas he had come, and Owen's heart beat with joy
for he felt that now “all would come right.” He
gave Beatrice a glad silent embrace as she stole
into her own room, and he sank into the light sleep
of boyhood, with a happy trust in the morrow.

mystery and vexation, rose to the sweet vision of
reconciliation and home joy. They had all agreed,
Mariana, Owen, and Beatrice, that it was impos-
sible Captain Brooke would not forgive his pet of
The Home, and cherish her husband, when the
excusing circumstances should be made known;
which as yet Beatrice had told to no one, but
which all were to know this sunshiny day.
Still pale with the excessive agitation of the
preceding night, but with this gladness on her
eager half-smiling lips and in her languid eyes,
Beatrice walked swiftly across St. James's Park,
absently dreaming of the return walk she might
perhaps make with HIM, her husband; to see him
and her father at last together as father and son!
He had begun, it is true, by saying that her father
asked an impossibility, but afterwards he had
yielded. He was merely to take the night to con-
sider how to declare his marriage; and now that
Maurice Lewellyn had seen her at his lodgings,
there would be little possibility of concealment.
Her father had gone out to breakfast with Mr.
Grey, and to see people on business afterwards.
She had not seen him since the previous night;
she did not wish to see him till she could stand

in his presence with her husband. That would
be very soon.
So dreaming, she passed through the narrow
gate of the Park at the crossing to Stratton
Street, hustling as she passed against another
absent little Alnaschar, in the shape of an
Italian boy, whose pardon she begged, with a
smile and a sixpence, and received from him in
return a rapid blessing, calling on God and all
the saints and the Santa Madonna, to guard her
to joy. Beatrice thought it a good omen to be
blessed in that dear Italian tongue (her mother's
language), and the stage of the opera house in the
Venetian moonlight was vividly before her, as she
stood on the step of Montagu's door in Stratton
Street, and crossed that threshold of her hope.
She was rather startled at the servant handing
her a note in Trêherne's handwriting. It con-
tained only the words—“There is a letter for
you in the glass Venetian casket in the drawing-
room, of which you have the duplicate key. I
wished you to read it here, quietly, before I see
you.—Yours ever, M.” He did not say when he
would be home.
Beatrice ascended the staircase with a trembling

step; an instinctive dread that all was not to be
as she had pictured it, in the coming day, stole
over her. The servant said, Mr. Treherne had
desired, if the lady called, that she should be
shown into the drawing-room, and that she would
find pen, ink, and paper there, if she wished to
write before he returned.
She locked the door, sat down, and drew the
bright Venetian casket towards her. For some
seconds she remained staring wistfully at it; at
its delicate spiral-threaded workmanship, and
faint purple and crimson stripes, through which,
like white clouds, the contents might be seen—
trifles which she and Montagu had placed there;
one or two gems in intaglio; some dried flowers
from the scanty store in the Botanical Garden at
Venice; a chaplet of olive seeds with silver beads
between, which the meek little Nubian servant
had timidly pressed on her acceptance when the
nursing of her illness was over and the plenteous
unexpected reward for her service bestowed;
scented charms and engraved talismans; and the
miniature pages of a tiny missal. You might
have thought some idle connoisseur was gazing at
that casket.

But the letter also was there. The letter!
Some letter he wished her to read before they
met. Some difficulty—something painful; she
felt sure of that. Well, whatever it was, she must
read it. It was there, lying among the other
papered and unpapered trifles that made the dim
cloud, sheltered by that delicate glass covering.
She unlocked the casket, and took the letter; it
lay on the surface of the other packets. The
address, “To Beatrice,” was in Treherne's hand-
writing. So were the contents.
“My dearest Beatrice,—
“If I could better bear the giving you
pain, I should have waited for you; and put into
words what I now put into writing. But I
shrink from the thought of tears from your
lovely eyes,—and from those passionate explana-
tions which distress people without altering the
condition of things discussed. I also cannot help
alluding (though not, believe me, with reproach)
to the gleam of violence in your manner, when
you said to me, “I WILL be owned as your wife.’
I have always had the impression, I scarce know
how, that you could be very violent; and no

one ever dreaded ‘scenes’ of any kind more than
I do.
“I might have reminded you when you took this
tone with me, how contrary it was to your own
vowed promise of submission at Trieste, where
you solemnly declared that my will should be
your will; but I pass that by, because I have also
reproaches to make to myself. I pass also the
great annoyance and probable injury to me, of
your meeting Maurice Lewellyn here (who will
of course immediately tell his father, and the
Wollinghams, and so publish it to my family),
because I would not be so unjust as to reproach
you with an accident you could not foresee, when
you adopted the unfortunate resolution of coming
without notice to Stratton Street. I come at
once to the heavy reproach I have to make myself,
and which, Heaven knows, entitles you to every
indulgence, even if I did not love you as passion-
ately as I do.

me, except that love | The trying moment

mination to compel my visit to your father, is

in my regret for the position we really stand in
towards each other,—which is simply this, Beatrice,
that we are not, as you suppose, man and wife!
You are not married to me. The reading of the
marriage ceremony, at the time of your deplorable
illness, was the result of a frenzied anxiety to
Soothe and save you. The person who read it was
not even in holy orders. A medical opinion had
been given that you would most probably die,
unless something could be contrived to alter the
state of excitement and dejection you were in.
There is no doubt that your life was saved by
that deception. You will say, “why continue it?
Why not tell me when I was better?” Think back
on that time yourself, Beatrice. Our first object,
after the delays of that unexpected voyage and
most inopportune illness, was to get back as soon
as possible to Trieste. I confess at first I was
amazed that you were so well satisfied with the sort
of ceremony that had been performed; I expected
that you yourself would request its repetition in
some church. You did not. The only observa-
tion you ever made was, that we had been more
sorrowfully and strangely united than Gretna
Green lovers. I put off telling you the real state

of the case till we should be at Trieste. I was so
happy—(we were so happy, Beatrice!)—that I
dreaded the breaking-up of that joy, till we could
follow the mock marriage with a real one. When
we reached Trieste, you know yourself that Mr.
Grey's letter scarcely left us hours—far less days
—to secure the important object of your return
with him and his wife. I was afraid to tell you
then. Afraid of I scarce knew what; of your
passion and vehemence; of your recklessly deter-
mining on remaining with me till we were mar-
ried, instead of catching at the providential op-
portunity of concealing all that had occurred.
I thought I could infinitely better arrange for
such a marriage after I had returned to London,
and had rejoined you there apparently in the
same position as when you left home. I let you
depart without making the confession; and yet, I
swear to you, it was the narrowest chance in the
world. You may remember how you stood, com-
forting me for our parting—assuring me you could
part cheerfully and gaily, knowing we were to
spend our lives together—and how dejected I was.
“That dejection was not for our parting, but for
the heavy secret at my heart! I was on the point

of telling you. Your very cheerfulness deterred me.
That,-and the brief time we had, to resolve any-
thing. I thought, ‘why break up this sunny calm
into a storm which may wreck us?” The thought
of your countenance (you never looked more
beautiful, Beatrice!) changing to resentment and
tears,—and, above all, as I have already told you,
the fear of your determining to stay,– conquered
my impulse.
“When we met in town, your father's release
from prison, and other circumstances, combined to
put more difficulties in the way of our meeting
than I had foreseen. My aunt Eudocia and
Mr. Grey kept a perpetual inquisition into my
engagements and habits of life. I thought when
they should leave town, and the season be over,
and the swarm of the world's fools dispersed who
make everybody's business their own, we might
then be quietly united. And from time to time
I confess the idea of deferring the more solemn
ceremony till I was of age, and could both marry
you and openly take you home, occurred to my
mind as the most prudent course.
“These are the causes which render it im-
possible for me to declare our marriage to your

father—or, as you expressed it, to own you for my
wife. No ceremony could make you dearer to me
than that melancholy reading by your sick-bed.
I feel for ever bound to you by that; and in spite
of the complications of our affairs in consequence
of your imprudence last night, and of your decla-
ration to your father,-I put my trust in your love,
and look forward to the future. I shall return
from Putney (where I have purposely gone to
spend the day with a friend, that you may have
time to grow calm, and collect yourself) to-night
or to-morrow early; and if you will come to
Stratton Street, I will watch for you, and Heaven
knows with what grateful joy I shall receive you
and consult with you as to possibilities. If you feel
resentment and bitterness,—and cannot at once
forgive what after all has been the result of one
unhappy accident after another,-leave me a note
in the same casket that held this. But do not
condemn me, Beatrice! Already all my destiny
is perilled for your sake; and if you are wounded
by my confession, remember how great is the
anxiety I have to bear!
“Yours ever,

Impossible to write a base selfish letter with
more unconsciousness!
For two hours and more, Beatrice sat immovable
as a statue. She did not faint. She never shed
a tear. She felt as if turned to stone. She might
have remained so through the day, but that the
declining sun came with a ruddy westward light
and smote across her eyes with its uncurtained
glow, from the high handsome window of the
room. Her eyelids quivered; she drew a deep
breath; she was conscious of life,—and a moan
escaped her lips, as though that fading sun had
the power attributed to the rising orb when it
strikes on Memnon's statue in the East.
Even then she did not sink to tears. She rose
and moved away out of that red glow—that glow
so like the sun in a warmer land. She walked to
and fro, over the rich soft carpet, with the looks
of a dethroned princess. She thought she was
able to calculate chances. She calculated how
much was true where so much had been false.
She felt that sudden distrust in all things, which
the perfidy of those we love inspires. The thought
stole through her brain, “What if this is only a
feint, to make it seem impossible to own me

to my father?” Then she strove to remember
who could prove what had occurred—who
ever knew of it, except the parties immediately
concerned.
Suddenly Beatrice stopped that pacing walk
—that walk of a creature in a cage. Treherne's
aunt was there, at that desert station the
Marchioness of Updown: she would know if the
chaplain of one of our Consulates was there the
same day. She, who would expect every English
traveller to be in a sort of attendance upon her;
who was always enquiring for news, and obtaining
service. Beatrice would at least make that dis-
covery. She remembered her visit to the Wol-
linghams which had been so painful, when every
one (except Helen!) had so evidently “wished
her to go away;” but she was reckless as to how
she was received. She would learn whether it
was possible some one in holy orders had read
that solemn service in that trembling compas-
sionate voice. It was impossible that could have
been a deception.
Yes, she would go and see the Marchioness.
And then she would return and leave a letter for
Treherne in the Venetian casket. And then?

then—oh ! blind, black, altered world, what is
the use of looking beyond that hour?
The impulse to know the one fraction of destiny
apparently within her grasp—the delirious avoid-
ance of that passive state to which Treherne's note
consigned her, taking himself off to Putney that
she might “have time to grow calm”—the desire,
whatever her eventful fate might be, to put it to
the test,
- And win or lose it all;
let her satisfy these, and then—then come
what come would !

CHAPTER XXVI.
.THE MARCHIONESS.
WHEN Beatrice reached Park Lane, the most
noble The Marchioness of Updown was at dinner.
She was dining unusually early, for a great ball
was to be given that night by the then Mistress of
the Robes; a ball at which Majesty itself was to
be present—“and all the élite of the nobility.” A
ball to which the Marchioness and all her dia-
monds and turquoises were going: with a glitter-
ing effort to outshine, at least in splendour of
attire, that graceful hostess,—who, if state and
station well became her, had the happiness of
“Cornelia's jewels” to boot, and stood among her
beautiful daughters with a soft dignity of welcome,
like one of Captain Brooke's white moss roses in

full bud, bowing its head in the sunshine of a
July day.
It required an amazing degree of labour to
prepare for such a ball,—especially as all balls
given or attended by Majesty begin a good deal
earlier than more common-place entertainments
of the same kind. There was a certain, though
very unequal, “division of labour.” That of The
Marchioness's attendants consisted in preparing
her elaborate costume and toiling attentively
over her prolonged toilette. The Marchioness
herself undertook the briefer but more important
2
labour of “undoing the work of Time;” unpick-
ing his seams, darning up his ravelling, festooning
his plain hems; and, with regard to his restless
out-door alterations, brightening up the frescoes,
and levelling and covering in, wherever he had
presumed, in Shakspeare's words, to
— dig deep trenches in her beauty's field.
By calculations founded on repeated experience,
it was computed that two hours and a half of this
combined industry of the labouring hands and
the master hand,—the practice of arts that were
purely mechanical, and of those which required in

addition some knowledge of design,-all working
with a good will together,-produced a most satis-
factory return; for it is certain that when the
wheels stopped work and the female labourers
retired to rest for a while (till called at the early
dawn to set wheels in motion again, and undo,
like Penelope, the web of the night), The Mar-
chioness sallied forth looking at the very least
ten years younger than she really was. To the
despair of many struggling contemporaries; the
melancholy tone of whose voices, as they con-
templated her and remarked, “How very beauti-
fully your hair is dressed! Did you get that
brocade from Palmyre?” was oil and balm to
her spirit; for she knew it meant that she was
looking remarkably well, and that they could not
look like her, try all they would.
This time she was resolved to outdo herself.
Two foreign sovereigns and a new ambassador
were to appear at the ball. To appear at the
ball, and consequently to behold The Marchioness.

cook on Dresden china—accompanied by some
excellent claret. -
The ball dress was upstairs, hanging in the
splendid dressing-room. Scarcely hanging either;
for what with its incrustation of jewels, and what

with the richness of the shimmering stuff on
which they were sown, that white and gold brocade
realised the enthusiastic expression applied to such
silks in female parlance, that they almost “stand
alone.” It was “standing alone” in the dressing-
room: and for any great addition of brains or
soul or heart, that it received when The Mar-
chioness entered into it, it might have gone
alone to the ball,—twirled round in the waltz,—
swum about in the quadrille,—swept through the
stately rooms,—descended the superb staircase,—
and so have returned home again, without loss.
Meanwhile it was undeniably a very marvel of
a ball dress! Jewels and agräffes were sown
down the front, and down the back, and round
the ample corsåge, and among the puffed knots
of the lace-trimmed sleeves, and across the skirt
in an angle, and looping up the skirt at the sides
—in short, wherever a jewel could be set, it
was set. Some of the jewels were false—but
nobody was supposed to know that; just as some
portions of The Marchioness herself were false, and
nobody was supposed to know it. The general
result was glittering, magnificent, and triumphant,

great pier glass, waiting for its inhabiting form—
The Marchioness.
Miss Parkes, the humble companion, was
also there; in close proximity to the empty
dress. Leaning her weary head against the great
carved mahogany bed-post shrouded in purple
silk curtains,—looking paler than ever against
that purple silk : very tired in her ancles,
having stood all day superintending the sewing
on of the jewelled barnacles on the white and
gold-embroidered hull. Resting—in a sort of dog's
sleep, half awake, and half in slumber; dream-
ing,-with her weak little grey eyes open, and
her cap awry,–of her girlhood and her mother,
and a county ball at Chippenham, Wilts, where
she had danced with a young lieutenant in the
navy long ago forgotten by everyone but her-
self, who was drowned in the Caspian Sea.
And Mrs. Benson, the lady's maid, was also
there, waiting upon the empty dress; less
fatigued than Miss Parkes, but more flushed
and excited. Very wide awake, having just
fortified herself against the coming hour by a
cup of tea with a little brandy in it, and with
a hearty professional interest in the appearance

The Marchioness was to make that night. For
Benson had a conscience—according to her idea
of conscience—and a thorough lady's maid
has the same noble pride in her lady's appear-
ance, that an officer has in the review of his
regiment. A belt awry, a shambling gait, a
loosely buckled collar, in the soldier, cannot be
more painful to his colonel, than a pin dropped
from its fastening, a tape wandering out to
public view, a crease in the silken folds, or a
drooping flaccid “sit of the petticoat” to the
Abigail of a well-bred house. Benson was “a
very superior person,” and she waited there,
alert and unfatigued—
Her soul in arms, and eager for the fray—
which was to enable her victoriously to declare
to some other Abigail, “Your lady did n’t look
half as well as my lady; nor I don’t think none
of the ladies at her Grace's ball was to compare
with my lady;” a boast Mrs. Benson was very
often enabled to make.
Nor was Mrs. Benson without a conscience of a
kindlier sort, though she reverenced marchionesses,
and was very severe upon “creatures;” for she

supported a very ricketty and rheumatic old
mother out of the wages given her (though they
were not over liberal, considering that she did
the work of two servants and a sentry, what with
toiling at the toilette, and sitting up “waiting”
for her lady): and at this very moment she was
planning, after the fatigue of the dressing was
over, to go to that old mother, and “see how
the dear old soul was a gettin' on.”
And Miss Parkes envied Mrs. Benson her
ricketty old mother, because—to use her own
phrase—“she had not a soul in the wide world
that she could care for, or that cared for her.”
And so with their different degrees of strength
and patience, both these women waited on the
empty dress; besides a brown-eyed rosy-cheeked
assistant, a country niece of Mrs. Benson's, to
whom this chance occasion, in which she was
permitted to labour, wore the mingled aspect
of a festival gala and a fairy tale; and who
found it, consequently, quite difficult to subdue
the radiant smiles of pleasure that parted her
red lips over her white young teeth—though
she felt it was somehow disrespectful to smile,
while so great a lady was about to put on so

grand a gown; besides that it must look “so
very childish’” and “so very countrified.”
Ah, little Mary !—how many of the jewelled
barnacles on the brocaded hull would the full-
sailing Marchioness have given,—if she could have
bought, at any price, those young smiles and that
shy flush of colour, — and have floated victo-
riously into the ball-room after making them
her own |
But The Marchioness was not cruising, but
dining; and when the groom of the chambers
said, towards the close of that meal, “Miss
Beatrice Brooke called about three-quarters of
an hour ago, to see your ladyship, but I told her
your ladyship was at dinner,” she put down
the Sèvres-handled fork with which she was
dividing a preserved nectarine, and exclaimed:
“Called to see ME! well, I never heard of such
a thing in my life.”
Unmoved in his aspect (for a well-trained
groom of the chambers does not participate in
little fleeting family emotions, but merely adds
a shade of gravity to his manner when there
are family deaths), he added, “Miss Beatrice
Brooke stated it to be her intention to call again,

a little later; she said it was of the greatest
importance she should see your ladyship.”
“Nonsense!” ejaculated The Marchioness, as
she pushed her plate away.
“I therefore wished to know,” said the un-
moved Mr. Floris, – after allowing a genteel
pause for The Marchioness to exclaim in,—“whe-
ther Miss Brooke is to be admitted, or whether
she is to be told that your ladyship is dressing?
I thought I had better learn your ladyship's
pleasure now, instead of disturbing your lady-
ship after your ladyship had gone upstairs.”
“Certainly, Floris, you did quite right. See
me!” mused The Marchioness. “What can
the girl want to see me about? I wonder,
now, whether she can want to dispose of that
set of coral 7–magnificent coral. They say
her father has been shockingly embarrassed.
Hum! well,—yes—I think you shall say both,
Floris; you shall say that I am dressing, and
you shall say that if Miss Brooke has anything
very particular to tell me—mind, very particular—
I will see her for a few minutes in my dressing-
room.”
So Beatrice – after sitting in the dying light

on a bench in Hyde Park, vaguely watching the
sunset; whose glory on the sweetest evening
comes to us in London veiled by some odd
cloud of dust and vapour, like a sunset seen
through grey muslin; and after waiting the
full time she thought would suffice for the
luxurious little dinner of the luxurious Mar-
chioness—came once more to the house, and was
ushered from the foot of the great-hall staircase
to the white floss rug at the door of the purple
dressing-room; and there the groom of the
chambers knocked and said, “Miss Brooke is
here, my lady,” and departed. And after she had
waited a few minutes on the white rug, pretty Mary
opened the door, dropped her little quick curtsy,
with her countrified phrase of “Servant, Miss,”
and Beatrice stood in the presence of The
Marchioness.
The room was surcharged with the perfumes
of different essences and the heat of unnumbered
wax lights; and the first sensation of Beatrice,
who had tasted no sort of food since her hurried
eight o'clock breakfast, was a deadly faintness.
She struggled against it. She knew the lack of
sympathy that lived in that room. She had not come

LOST AND SAVED. 285
there for sympathy, but for information—informa-
tion on one especial point—and when she had
obtained it, she would go away.
Her eyes, which for the last hour had rested
on dim crimson and grey clouds in the fading
sky, wandered past the glittering toilette and the
still more glittering empty dress, in search of
living forms—in search of the mature Columbine
of this dazzling pantomime; while countrified
Mary, the corners of her rosy mouth dropped
to an expression of amazed pity, wondered if
it would be too dreadful a liberty to offer a cup
of tea out of Benson's forsaken teapot, by way
of refreshment, to this wild, sick-looking, most
beautiful young lady.
But now The Marchioness turned; and by
turning conveyed to Beatrice's confused vision a
more distinct notion of where she sat amongst all
this glitter and frippery than her weary eyes had
yet been able to obtain. Indeed, had Miss Brooke
been a more accustomed visitor in that purple
carpeted room, she would have known at once
where to look for its occupant; for The Mar-
chioness was merely sitting where she generally
sat when she was not lounging in her magnificent

carriage, or lolling on her magnificent sofa,—that
is, in front of her magnificent looking-glass.
She had sat very still, however, for a few minutes,
for she was holding up a different earring for each
ear, and intently observing the effect; being un-
able at once to decide if she would wear earrings
of diamonds and turquoise, having the necklace
on, belonging to that suite; or of diamonds only,
having diamonds without turquoises in her hair.
And Miss Parkes and Mrs. Benson also stood silent
and spell-bound, also gazing at the two earrings.
Only countrified Mary looked at Beatrice, till The
Marchioness turned.
She turned and looked, not at her visitor's face,
but at her hands (still thinking of the possible
coral), and it was not till she perceived them
utterly empty of any little bandbox or jewel-case,
that she raised her eyes to Beatrice's, and said,
“Well, Miss Brooke, how do you do, and what
are you come about?” After which she resumed
the silent study of the earrings, leaving Beatrice
apparently to address any answer she had to make
to the back of her corpulent white shoulders.
“I wish,” said Beatrice, timidly, “I wish I
might speak to you alone.”

“You want me to send Benson away? Well,
I am sure! What harm can Benson do you?”
And again she scanned Beatrice, as if she thought
the coral might be in her pocket or under her
black silk mantilla. “But however, you may go,
Benson, for a few minutes; and the girl may go.
No, Miss Parkes, you need n’t go; I must have
somebody. You won’t mind Parkes, I suppose ?
Nobody minds Parkes. Parkes can hold the jewel-
cases; I never ask her to do anything menial; I
did n’t engage with her to do anything menial. I
sometimes get her to hold the pincushion when
I’m dressing, but I don’t call pincushions menial.
Now go on with whatever you have got to say, for
the carriage will be round directly, and I must go
the moment it is announced.”
But Beatrice had broken down. While yet The
Marchioness was insisting on the impossibility of
doing without some one attendant, and explaining

scene before her to the recollection of another
ball,—the ball The Marchioness herself had given,
and at which she had been present. The music, the
voices, the sights of that night returned; she no

longer saw the glittering room, the stand-alone
dress, the purple silk hangings. Her eyes
Were with her heart—and that was far away, -
far away with the Treherne of other days; smiling
at her, dancing with her, leading her proudly in
to supper, among the whispered complimentary
observations of friends and acquaintances.
Her enforced calm melted into a gush of
bitter tears; she sobbed aloud. Pale Miss Parkes
trembled, with the unmenial jewel-case in her
hand; the vainly exiled Benson stole to the inter-
vening door, and stood listening with a severe
countenance to a sound so unmeet in the boudoir
of aristocratic life – Miss Brooke crying and
shrieking like a “creature;” and little Mary
turned away and wept for sympathy only with the
sound of other weeping.
The Marchioness was startled; she was out-
raged; she was at once provoked and embarrassed;
like all persons of very cold feelings in the pre-
sence of those who give way to violent emotion. She
coloured visibly, even through her rouge (and was
struck by it as a favourable effect in the mirror).
She laid down the earring on the dressing-table,

and said petulantly, “I beg, whatever you have to
say, Miss Brooke, you won’t sit sobbing and shriek-
ing there. Don’t be so like a distressed governess,
I beg ! There is nothing I hate like this sort of
thing; it is so very—so very vulgar ! Pour
yourself out a glass of water and drink it,
and whatever you have to say, say it like a
lady, and have done with it. I only hope (for
the idea had crossed The Marchioness's mind
that Beatrice might be come to ask aid from the
wealthy for her father)—I only hope you are not
here with any foolish idea that the Marquis or I
could lend any money, or anything of that kind,
because we can’t; and as it is, I have only half an
opera-box this season with Eudocia; and if I
had the power, I can tell you I’d much rather
give the very, very little I have to give, to any-
body that came quietly and decently, than I
would—”
Beatrice interrupted her; The Marchioness was
always garrulous when she became angry, or, as
she expressed it, “flurried,” and it was difficult
to stop her; but Beatrice said with the most icy
composure, “I beg your pardon; it is only fatigue;
I will not detain you a moment. I believe you

were at the central Desert Station on the way to
Suez in the month of September last?”
“Well, I was,” said the puzzled Marchioness;
her recollection of Egypt and its beads coming
back, with another confused glimpse of the coral
she could not help imagining Beatrice was about
to offer for sale. “I was—what then?’
“Did you meet,” faltered Beatrice—“were you
acquainted with—do you know if a clergyman,
the chaplain of an English consulate, halted there
at the same time?”
The Marchioness stared. “No; I am perfectly
certain there was nobody of the kind; perfectly
certain, because I had the greatest difficulty get-
ting sufficient accommodation for our party;
indeed, as it was, Parkes was obliged to sleep in
Benson's room, and I believe the doctor slept in
the Marquis's room. I am quite certain no chap-
lain, no Englishman was there; if there had been,
naturally I should have insisted on having his
room, because that would have given us one room
more, and a man can sleep anywhere. Horrid

whom my nephew Montagu wanted assistance for.
How came you to know—”
Suddenly the Marchioness stopped; she turned
her glittering eyes and her glittering diamonds
full upon Beatrice; she contemplated her as she
sat there, pale, still, and defiant.
“You were the girl that was travelling with
him l” she said.
No answer, no denial; the pale defiant face
looked paler still, the eyes more wildly vague.
Gentle Miss Parkes broke through all proper
bounds of humble companionship, and flying
to Beatrice's side, chafed her hands between
her own little scraggy palms, saying meekly,
“My dear, let me untie your bonnet; let me
help you. My dear, can I not help you in some
way?”
“Miss Parkes, are you mad, or are you in your
Christian senses?” exclaimed the exasperated
Marchioness. “Let this unhappy young woman
go about her business; Isuppose she and my nephew
have had some dispute about what shall be done
for her. I can’t interfere! Most improper! She
don’t even deny that she was travelling with him
as his mistress.”

“I do deny it; I was travelling with him as his

“I never heard such an impudent imposture

is as good as engaged to one of the Wollinghams!

never to put eau-de-mousseline upon anything of

me to do in the matter; all I know is, that I
can't interfere. As you’ve brewed, so you must

was sure to be taken in by some one. Where is
my shawl? Have you lost your senses, Miss
Parkes? Benson Benson, will you come and
help me on with my shawl—if anyone still has
their senses about them 7”
Benson came in, and Beatrice tottered out; she
felt wonderfully ill and bewildered, as if she scarce
knew where she stood; but she was conscious that
poor Miss Parkes had followed her outside the
door, on to the flossy white rug. They made a
moment's halt there.
“Let me call you a cab, my dear,” said the pity-
ing Miss Parkes. “I don’t mind the least; I don’t
even want a bonnet. See, I’ll tie this handker-
chief over my head. If you will wait till the
Marchioness is gone, I’ll go home with you; do
let me.”
But Beatrice shook her head faintly, and
said she was going only a few steps—going to a
friend “close by;” and the imperious voice of
the Marchioness, authoritatively calling her
humble companion back, to do something “not
menial,” put a stop to the colloquy.

The house door was already open. The foot-
men were standing in their state liveries and
gold-headed canes, waiting to usher their lady
into the state carriage, with its state hammer-
cloth and wigged coachman. All was gorgeous
colour flaring under the lamps, and Beatrice passed
between them like a dark shadow, and glided
slowly and wearily back, to leave a letter for
Treherne in the Venetian casket. After which,
the most noble the Marchioness of Updown got
into the state carriage and went to the ball, to
meet her most gracious Majesty and the two
foreign sovereigns, and the new ambassador, and
the other ambassadors, and dukes, and duchesses,
and lords and ladies innumerable, being in fact
the élite of the nobility, as was announced next
day in all the papers.

CHAPTER I.
BROTHER's LOVE.
OUTSIDE that other door—outside Montagu Tre-
herne's threshold-pacing up and down, as pale
as herself, looking up with questioning eyes at
the windows, was Owen Brooke. He saw her; he
came rapidly towards her.
“Oh, Beatrice! come home, come home!” was
all he could say. And Beatrice answered wildly,
“I do not know what my father may decide
about me. Come in here a moment. How did
you know where to look for me?”
“I heard you say last night to the coachman,

Treherne lived there. I could not doubt—but oh!
Beatrice, come home. We have expected you all
day; and when dinner time came and you did not
appear, my father went out. Come home, dear!
If Montagu Treherne will not come to my poor
father, he is a villain.”
“Owen, he cannot; our marriage was not legal,
it seems;” (even then Beatrice could not bear to
admit that Montagu was a villain). “He has
written me a letter of explanation.”
“Has he appointed a day to marry you le-
gally?”
“No,-but he will; I am sure he will.”
“Where is he P’”
“He is gone out of town for a day.”
“Leaving you!—leaving you after that dis-
tressful yesterday ! Where, then, have you
been P”
“I have been with his aunt, Lady Updown.
I thought—it is a long story, and I will tell it
you another time—I thought she would know if
our marriage could be proved.”

“Proved ! I will kill him. I will challenge
him, and shoot him. He thinks, perhaps, because
I am a mere boy, he can laugh at me,—but I can
feel a wrong and fire a pistol, as well as an older
man.”
“You would only disgrace me for ever, Owen,
and kill the man I look upon as my husband. I
am sure he will make me his lawful wife. It is
only my father's anger I am dreading—his anger,
and his sorrow.”
“And why did not Lady Updown bring you
home P”
“She is gone to a great ball at Belvidere
House; it was to begin early. The Queen is to
be there. Besides, I have a letter to leave here.”
“The Queen?”
“Yes; it made Lady Updown impatient about
the hour.”
“Too impatient to think of such a sorrow,
Beatrice l’” said the boy, with a scornful smile.
Beatrice shook her head.
“My dear Owen, before I go home with you (if,

indeed, my father will receive me), I have a letter,
as I tell you, to write here, and to leave here.
It will not take me long, if you like to wait.”
She tried to write without tears, but could not.
Owen rose, and restlessly paced the apartment—
went to the window and muttered, “At the ball,
with the Queen;” – then he went to the writing
table and drew a sheet of paper towards him,
wrote a note, and carefully sealed it. He put it
in his bosom, and spoke to Beatrice.
“My dear, I only interrupt you; I will walk
round the park and come back for you here, and
we will go home together. You promise me
that ?”
“I promise.”
Owen ran down stairs, walked rapidly down the
street, across the Green Park to the very gates of
Buckingham Palace. A great crowd had assem-
bled to see the royal carriage issue out from the
gates. He was in time. The Queen had not yet
set out for the ball.
In time for what? Not for the show. Owen

was in no mood for shows, eager and loyal though
his boyish heart might be. He was * in time" to
act the wild romantic scheme which had shot up
like a sudden flame in his mind after listening to
his sister; while watching her suffocated tears,
and thinking of the fine lady going forth to that
magnificent scene of gaiety, leaving this girl to
moan and strive. -
Treherne's aunt! Was this to be the mode in
which the ladies of that family were to take the
disgrace of Captain Brooke's daughter? Was this
to be the mode in which gentlemen of noble
English blood were to act with impunity?
Beatrice had spoken truly; if he killed Treherne,
he would only publish and seal her disgrace. But
he would make that traitor fulfil his vows to his
sister. He would make him satisfy his father. The
Queen l—she was going to this ball ! This ball,
where the good and the bad of her aristocracy
were to meet on common ground, like the tares
and wheat of Scripture. He would appeal to the

Of women flinging themselves before the horses of
kings and emperors, begging a son's or a husband's
life; of interviews granted, in spite of stiff
court rules, to despairing petitioners, who prayed
to those Anointed Ones as fervently as to Heaven,
finding them with almost as much apparent power

Flitting through his excited brain went many

and Napoleonesque romance; the sweet story of
Elizabeth of Siberia; and a thousand instances
of pardons granted, innocence justified, oppres-
sion put down, and wrongs redressed, by the lifting
of a sceptre, by the speaking of a stern majestic
word. Boyish gatherings; half truth and half
fiction—culled from among the faded traditions
of kings who had reigned as “fathers of their
people.”—not as idols of brass and clay set upon
thrones.

justification; for if she swam, she was reckoned
guilty, and executed; and if she sank, of course
she was drowned. With these have passed also
the days (if they ever existed) when monarchs,
at the last moment, forbade the cutting off of some
particular head, already within hail of the block;
and bestowed the hands of their male and fe-
male subjects with as much peremptory decision
as the King of France in “All's well that
ends well,” when he marries the recalcitrant
Bertram to Doctor Gerard de Narbon’s love-sick
daughter.
But though these things have passed away in
fact, —in the imagination of the ignorant and the
inexperienced they still vaguely exist. The
“sighing of the poor prisoner” in Newgate, still
connects “the Queen's pardon”—not with the
preparation of legal forms and the decision of
legal authorities, but with an actual amnesty from
the throne; and the feebler and worst informed
portion of her Majesty's subjects firmly believe
that among the excellent powers conferred by

“divine right,” is that of righting their wrongs
by her personal interference.
Owen Brooke was not more stupid or ignorant
than other young midshipmen of his age; but he
somehow imagined that an appeal to the Queen
might be followed by her Majesty's compelling
Treherne to do justice to his sister.
Thinking so, he acted on that thought. He
was like Beatrice. Such natures will not await
the coming event; they cannot watch the subtle
alchemy of brooding days, even though the chance,
of a golden hour lie there. They are for ever
wrestling before dawn with the dark angel of Des-
tiny,—reckless if their victory shall send them
lamed and limping from Peniel.
His mother's blood ran in Owen's veins—that
southern blood which, if it have not all the ex-
aggeration of qualities attributed to “the land of
the cypress and myrtle,” has at least a quickness
unknown to calmer souls. Love, with such natures,
is a delirium—so is anger-so is jealousy; even
their pity is a passion. The warm Spanish blood

is full of the spirit of intrigue; but the Italian
has the simplicity of a child in all that touches
the affections, and the rash eagerness of a child
in all plans for their satisfaction.
Owen's hope might be a vain dream, like the
hope of many an older and wiser sufferer; but
the chance of that hope's fulfilment lay in his own
unaided energy; or so he thought.
He took the letter he had written from his
bosom, and he took from his purse a small pebble,
with a green cord run through a hole pierced
in the stone. He twisted the cord round the folded
paper, and waited and watched. He thought
over the words of his letter—whether it was too
long—whether it sufficiently expressed the urgent
necessity of his case—whether it was addressed
properly; being directed, in a round fair hand,
to Her Gracious Majesty the Queen of Great Bri-
tain and Ireland. It was headed, “The petition of
Owen Brooke, Midshipman of H.M.S. ‘Enter-
prise, now resident in Spring Gardens, Charing
Cross”— and was couched in these terms—

A cry from the eager crowd of “The Queen!
the Queen!” roused Owen from reverie to action.
It was a sweet summer night, breathless and
warm. The windows of the carriages were open.
Owen pressed to the front of the crowd, and as
the Royal carriage passed, amid the vociferous
cheers of the delighted multitude, he raised his
arm and flung his letter, fastened and weighted
as it was, right in the direction of the carriage
window !
His aim was too good to have failed of its
intent, but that, at the very instant of projection,
the watchful eye of the police noticed the boy's
gesture. His arm was seized with a grasp of iron;
the pebble fell short, and hit the edge of the
panel instead of entering the window. The sharp
sound of its striking, light as it was, was enough
to alarm the ear. “Seize him !”—“Hold him l’”
—“Some one has fired a shot at the Queen l’”
—“Drag him down!”—“That's the lad!”—“Her
Majesty has been fired at !”—“Monster!”—
“You’ll be hung for this!”—“Stand out of the

way of the horses!”— and a thousand similar con-
tradictory cries rose around him. A moment of
unutterable confusion followed. He was pulled,
pummelled, cuffed, collared, and bruised; and
when, at length, something like order was restored,
when instead of half-a-dozen vigorous arms grap-
pling him at once, he found himself panting in
the grasp of a single sergeant of police, with
another tall sergeant in possession of “the missile
he had flung at the Queen’’ as they termed his
unlucky letter with its pebble weight, —he was
marched off to the station.
It was of no use attempting to explain. No
one would listen to him; no one would believe him;
and if they had believed, they could do nothing; it
was their duty merely to see the charge entered
in the police sheet, and lodge him in a secure
cell for the night.
His wrist was strained, swollen, and bruised.
The police sergeant had, as he expressed it, “little
lads of his own,” and was sorry the boy had been

so roughly handled. He dipped Owen's hand-
kerchief in some vinegar and water, and bound
the hand up. He then looked at him in
silence.
“Well, now, what could put it into the head
of a young gent like you, to do such a thing?
You’d better send to some of your friends, afore
it gets any later.” -
Owen wrote a note to his father, begging him
not to be anxious; that he was in custody on
the mistaken supposition that he had flung a
missile at the Royal carriage; that he could
“rough it” for the night in his cell, with a
very clear conscience as to any want of love or
loyalty to his sovereign; and in the morning he
hoped his father would come and bail him
out.
Fain would he also have sent to Beatrice—but
how could he? Could he direct “to Miss Brooke,”
and send it to Treherne's lodgings? And if he
sent the vague message that “the young gentle-

man who called was unable to rejoin the lady,” it
would infallibly create wonder and inquiry.
Neither did he like Beatrice to know he had been
taken to the station-house. Perhaps by this time
Treherne would have returned from Putney, and
would see her to the door of home, as he did the
night before. Or she might already have gone
home to avoid his return—and that was Owen's
best hopel
The time seemed interminable before the door
of the cell re-opened, and the watch informed
Owen that his note had been delivered, but that
the gentleman he had written to was out, so it
was left; that was all.
“Out? still out—so late l’’
The boy vainly endeavoured to compose himself
to rest. His arm throbbed and thrilled with
pain, and his heart ached thinking of his plan
for helping Beatrice; thinking of his baffled hope;
thinking of the gay ball to which the carriages had
all moved on, leaving him and his luckless letter
in the guard of the police; leaving her to tears;

with him on the sands at Tenby!
And Beatrice sat thinking of him, as he
thought of her; thinking of him; waiting for
him; wondering he did not come.
Her letter, too, had been written' written and
locked away in the Venetian casket. It said:–
“I have your letter, Montagu. If what it
contains had been written of you, instead of by
you, no oaths would have made me believe it.
As it is, I have doubted even what you tell me of
yourself! I have no worse words with which to

“As to my illness, during which this terrible
deception took place—would that I once more

such means from my approaching doom, so that
I died with my trust in you unbroken. Sickness

The sound of your voice, the sound even of your
step on the stair, held all earth's music for me.
I have loved the very shawl I wore when we have

floated from my cheek to yours—the books that
you have touched—the pictures your eyes have
rested on; but I will never see you again—NEVER!

When that was written and locked away, the
restless heart began to beat again: to quake with
new terrors, as the time passed on and the face of
her handsome young brother never shone like a
star of hope among the few passers by on whose
features the lamplight fell, when the sound of
footsteps drew Beatrice starting to the window.

such an hour? Surely yes; for how could she stay
where she now was; and where else could she go?
Her father could only refuse to see her; he could
not thrust her out into the street. And Mariana
would patiently expect her. Mariana, with her
sweet, pale, watchful face, would be waiting now,
whatever else was to happen.
Beatrice would go home, then, directly; it
was of no use expecting Owen any more; and if
she lingered, Treherne might return! She drew
her black silk mantle round her with a shudder;
she felt wonderfully ill; she had had no food all
day. She reached the bell and rang it; and said
faintly to the servant-girl—
“Will you tell Mr. Treherne I have written to
the person he requested me to write to,-and will
you get me a cab P”
She was still standing as she spoke; but before
the maid could obey the order, she tottered
forwards, and sank in a swoon to the ground.
The frightened girl made no attempt to lift

CHAPTER II.
LOVER's LOVE.
ANOTHER morning had dawned. It is already four
o'clock, and the magnificent ball at Belvidere
House is thinning rapidly of its numbers. Car-
riages are no longer cutting in and cutting out,
amidst the energetic protestations of their inmates,
the curses of their coachmen, and the authorita-
tive interference of the police. Sweeping swiftly
up to the noble portico, each receives its freight,
and sweeps as swiftly away; and the glittering
dresses and bare shoulders of the ladies, and smart
diplomatic uniforms and stars of the gentlemen,
look strange in the natural light. The fresh
young faces have heavy lids to their bright young

eyes, and the withered old faces have heavy cheeks,
and a “drookit” look, which no gorgeousness of
apparel can somehow efface.
Treherne comes out of that house. Yes, Tre-
herne. Not that he went there for pleasure, or
would have cared to miss it, even had he not been
anxious and “out of sorts,” but because it was one
of the necessities of his world that he showld be
there; and he had been reminded of it at dinner
at Putney, and urged to go, on account of the new
ambassador, and Viennese colleagues and diplo-
matic interests, and persons he was to be presented
to, and persons who had spoken of him, and who
looked forward to meeting him, and because it
would “ look odd" if he stayed away—all that
group of majesty, foreign and English, and all the
“élite of the nobility” attending. So he dressed at
his club; as indeed he often did, but was more es-
pecially bent on doing that night because he
thought if he went home he might find some re-
proachful letter in the Venetian casket, and it was
time enough to read anything disagreeable, after

he could get an hour or two to himself, and not
just as he was compelled to “make the agreeable”
among eight hundred acquaintances. He hoped
the best; he hoped that Beatrice might have left a
line merely promising to come next morning, and
“talk over possibilities,” for he knew how pas-
sionately she loved him; but he did not feel sure;
not sure enough to do so un-Treherne-ish a thing
as expose himself to the chance of pain which
could be avoided.
His stars, however, were unpropitious that
night; for he had to endure pain, and provocation,
and anger too, even at the ball where he meant
to evade them.
He danced with Helen Wollingham; who could
not get leave to remain at home invalided on so
great an occasion. She looked beautiful, but very
delicate, and was very silent. She asked him as
they stood up for a quadrille, “if he still saw
much of Beatrice Brooke P” He turned sharply
round, and hesitated; then he said rather sulkily,
“Of course;” that he was not going to drop the

Brooke family as Lady Eudocia had done. The
rest of the figure was danced without further
attempt at conversation. Then Helen Wollingham
said in a low tone of voice, “Do you know if
Maurice Lewellyn is coming?” Again, with a
sharp, angry, conscious glance, Treherne turned
and looked at his cousin. She blushed and averted
her eyes. Had Lewellyn already disclosed to the
Wollinghams his awkward meeting with Beatrice?
Helen's delicate cheeks paled again, and she
said quietly, “I only asked because he is not
here; and I know he received a card for this ball
a fortnight ago, and meant to come. I sup-
pose he is gone to see his father and mother
off; they went by the express this afternoon
to Dover with poor Mr. Lewellyn; perhaps he is
fatigued and they mean to sleep there.”
Treherne was relieved; he felt sure Helen, at
least, had heard nothing about him and Beatrice;
and he was excessively glad to find Sir Bertie and
Lady Di Lewellyn were actually gone.
But as he led Helen back to her place by her

mother, fresh disturbance awaited him. Lady
Eudocia's back was turned, she was talking eagerly
to the Marchiones. They were “chattering like
pyets,” and continued chattering; not even re-
marking the approach of the young dancers; their
eyes clashing again and again at each other in
the heat of argument, as if gunflints had been
struck together to produce sparks. The words
“Beatrice Brooke,”—“Montagu,”—“Central
Station,”—“impossible falsehood,” —" forced her
way in, while I was dressing,”—“sobbed like a
âniac”—“all your fault for having her to that
ball last year”—“could do no more than take
the trouble to tell you immediately,” greeted
Treherne's ear, in rapid phrases of suppressed
loudness. “What is all this?” he said, with
something of the hard imperious look that made
him occasionally resemble so closely his aunt
Eudocia. “What is all this?”
“Humph! here he is, Eudocia; and you may ask
him yourself if it is true, for I’m sure I shan’t,’
said the Marchioness, sullenly.

“I will ask him, and that this moment ! You
will at least be good enough to take charge of
Helen, I suppose, while I speak to him. She’s not
to dance the next dance, she’s to rest. Montagu,
I want to ask you a question;” and Lady Eudocia,
crimson with anger and excitement, led the way
out on the balcony, followed by her nephew.
What a calm moonlight night it was! Shining
down on those angry faces, and opposing the in-
effectual freshness of its light breeze to the puffs
of warm vapour, made up of a thousand essences
from a thousand different toilette tables and the
breath of a thousand crowded human beings,
which ever and anon saluted the morning through
those open windows!
“Beatrice Brooke has been to The Marchioness
this evening before she came here, and told her in
the very presence of Parkes, that she was your
wife. Now, I ask you as a gentleman, whether
that is true or not?”
Fierce, abrupt, her hard eyes defyingly fixed on
his eyes, waiting his reply.

She did not wait long; no beacon-fire, flashing
from hill to hill quick rallyings for war, ever
woke a speedier answering flame. Intense anger
thrilled hotly through Treherne's breast. The
sudden picture of Beatrice's “vehemence” taking
a turn he had never dreamed of; braving him
with a vengeful effort at ruin, by denouncing
him to the members of his own family; compel-
ling him to a public avowal of his connection with
her, and doubtless to public amends; a picture of
Beatrice, proud, passionate, strong, and defying;
rushing, perhaps with his very letter in her
hand, to the house of this scornful fine lady,
to claim her “rights” and profess herself the
triumphant obstacle to all their worldly schemes,
and all his worldly prosperity, filled his mind.
Beatrice as a sort of Norma—a maddened
Bianca—a beautiful curse—for whose love he
would have to pay a price such as no woman, were
she Venus and all the Muses combined, could ever
be worth. Beatrice as he had never seen her,-
but as he could vaguely imagine even she might

become, when told that she “was not really mar-
ried,”—such a Beatrice flashed before Treherne's
eyes! Came as all thoughts come—came like
the lightning; and he gave his soul no pause of
heavenward gazing, before he answered, with such
vehement loudness that Helen Wollingham heard
and started,—“She did? Well then, I swear
before God, and on the honour of a gentleman,
that she is not my wife!”
Before God, and on the honour of a gentle-
Iman.
There was a pause. Lady Eudocia broke it
by muttering, rather than saying, “Nevertheless,
your uncle Caërlaverock wrote to me to put me
on my guard against the intrigues of this girl;
and to tell me of some very foolish scene that
took place between him and you; and to advise
me——”
Treherne set his teeth. “Aunt Eudocia, I
forbid you ever to mention this subject to me
again, if you expect me to remain on speaking
terms with you!”

That sentence, also, was spoken with such
reckless exasperation, that it was completely
audible to the Marchioness and Helen; and Lady
Eudocia, confounded by a passion even greater
than her own, and afraid of the next result being -
the attention of “the world” to the very dis-
agreeable scene taking place between such near
relations, hastily re-entered the ball-room and
resumed her seat.
Treherne also passed in from the balcony. For
a moment he paused, opposite the incrusted ball-
dress of the Marchioness, and fixed his haughty
handsome eyes on her face, as if he thought to ask
her some question; but if he had any such inten-
tion, he changed his mind—and making his way
with a sort of fierce patience through the crowd,—
answering a rapid observation here, and submitting
to the delay of an introduction there; assenting to
the too notorious truth that it was “very hot,”
and promising to “be sure and call my carriage”
to ten weary chaperons in succession; pouring out
a tumbler full of champagne, and swallowing it

at a draught, as he passed through the supper-
room; looking out the shawl of the Austrian
ambassadress; stumbling in the cloak-room
upon the already shawled and departing Milly
Nesdale,—to whom he apologised without even
perceiving at first who he was speaking to;
maddening over the determined deafness with
which she then ignored the announcement of
her carriage, and waiting with her till it came
round again and he could put her into it with a
pacifying pressure of the hand;—after thus
running the gauntlet through every stage of
hindrance, he at length stood in the morning air;
free to get away from the mingled sounds of
linkmen hoarsely shouting outside, and the
music of the cotillon playing within—and return
to the silence of his bachelor home.
But Treherne did not go home. The phrase
used by Lady Eudocia in speaking of Beatrice's
declaration—“in the very presence of Parkes”
— festered in his heart. He would see Parkes,
and hear how Beatrice had behaved. He was

not afraid of the Marchioness's return; he knew
that jewel-bearing peeress too well to expect her
home while yet there remained any groups from
the lessening crowd at Belvidere House to be
dazzled by her sumptuosity. And if she did -
return, he cared not. Why had she made such
mischief?
There was no difficulty in obtaining admittance,
even at this hour. The expectant porter left his
great black chair at the sound of wheels—even
before Montagu's groom had given the light
knock that surprised his ears, prepared as they
were only for the magnificent thunder proper
to the returning chariot. The alert Benson
looked over the upper landing of the stairs where
Beatrice had waited on the white floss rug;
and pallid Miss Parkes started up, still attired
in her morning dress, ready to perform all tasks
the Marchioness might demand of her that
were not “menial.” She came meekly down
when she heard Mr. Treherne wished to speak
with her. She answered his interrogatories with

the simplest truth, and in a tone whose com-
passion never broke into emotion. She had
seen too much sorrow, and had to “command
her feelings” among strangers too long, to
trouble him with any evidence in words or
tears of her sympathy with Beatrice. Perhaps
it was this very simplicity that affected Treherne.
His heart smote him as he listened; a pain
came over it, sore as the pain of an un-
healed wound. It was his Beatrice who had
been there; his own poor Beatrice, — not the
frantic Beatrice of his ball-room dream,-what-
ever imprudence might be in the step she had
taken -
He rose with a remorseful sigh; and not
knowing exactly how to express what passed in
his mind to Miss Parkes, he shook that timid
little lady by the hand. And then, and then
only, Parkes burst into tears. -
He drove rapidly to Stratton Street, opened
the street door, took the light from the hall
table, and went quickly into the drawing-room;

stood.
He read Beatrice's letter. He read it over
and over again. Over and over again. Till at
last it condensed itself into the single sentence,
“I will never come again to the house I imagined
was my husband’s.” -
NEVER! His Beatrice — his loving, passionate,
beautiful Beatrice; the very sunshine of whose
eyes was a caress; who but the night before
had bid him farewell, her head leaning on his
shoulder, her eyes lifted to his with such
petitioning sweetness!
“Never again.” Do women keep such vows?
Could she bear the blank days, after months of
love, and joy, and eager meetings? Could he bear
them? Supposing that Beatrice kept her despair-
ing resolution,-could he, himself, bear the coming
blank? Did he ever see her equal before?
Should he ever again see anything to compare
with her? In the ball-room he had just left,

He was so lost in the reverie that he did not
even hear the drawing-room door open. Perhaps
he had left it open, in his haste to see what sort
of letter Beatrice had locked in the casket; at all
events, he did not know anyone had entered, till
his landlady's voice close to his ear—anxiously
repeating his name—roused him with a start of
amazement. -
“Mr. Treherne, oh, sir! I am so thankful you
are come in ; and I do hope and trust you will
think I have done for the best—sending for no
one—and that you will get the young lady back

fit; and I would have sent for a doctor, but she
beseeched me not. She held my arm so tight by
both hands (I’m sure I’d never have thought such
delicate-looking hands could hold so tight as she
held me), and she said, “Send for no one. I
confide in God's mercy, and in yours. On your
life, send for no one!’—just so. “I’m not afraid
of pain, she said; “I’m not afraid of death,
except that I should not like to die here. Nor
she wasn’t afraid of pain; and she prayed—I’m
sure it did one good to hear her pray! and she
spoke very gentle and kind about you, sir, when
she thought she was dying.”
“Dying!”
“Yes—yes, sir; but she arn’t dying—not a bit.

and I’m sure it would have melted a heart of

her, and she kissed him and said, ‘Oh, dear
lamb forgive your father——and me!’ I’m sure,
sir, when you come to think of it, you’ll try and
get her back to her friends. I couldn’t get a
word out of her who she belonged to, nor who
she would have sent for. Nor she wouldn’t have
a doctor on no account. All she said was, ‘Mr.
Treherne will be here to-night or to-morrow—
send for no one;” and once she laid her hand on
mine and said, “Many poor creatures in this
great distress have no friend, nor a shelter over
their heads, yet see how kind and motherly you
—who are a stranger—have been to me.’ And
not a bit of victuals had she remembered to take
all day; she owned as much to me, when I
brought her a little gruel and a bit of toast. Oh,

really can’t, to my thinking), I’m sure I’d take
care of it for nothing—that I would– till it was
fit for schooling.”
She might, if she pleased, have extended her
monologue to even greater length. Treherne
neither stopped her nor answered her. He re-
mained master of but one idea. It was no
longer at his own option to save Beatrice. The
heir of his name that should have been—the heir
of the Earls of Caërlaverock—was heir to nothing
but shame; and his welcome to the world was, that
even the kindly lodging-house keeper thought
his speedy departure from it a thing that must
naturally be desired by all—except by “the
mother.”
Treherne went down to the apartment where
Beatrice lay. She was asleep, but woke at his
entrance, noiseless though his step had been.
“Forgive me, and get well,” he said. “You
shall find my whole life devoted to making you
amends.”

“If it had pleased God that my poor babe had

LIKE the soft echo of a lovely sound, the clear
sunlight of yesterday morning is repeated to-day
in the cloudless sky; and the world is awake again
and busy with all its good and evil deeds. Among
its evil deeds are the night charges in the police-

“Well, young gentleman, what have you to say
to this most preposterous, this most criminal
attempt of yours?”
Such was the address made to Owen after the
account of his conduct had been fully gone into,

and the pebble-weighted letter had been duly
read. The magistrate raised his spectacles and
looked Owen in the face. “What is the meaning
Of it?”
“I intended no wrong, sir. I merely wished to
convey a petition to the Queen.”
“That is not the way to convey a petition to
the Queen. You state yourself here to be a
midshipman in the Royal Navy.”
“I am a midshipman, on board the ‘Enterprise,’
war-steamer.” J
“Do you know how many midshipmen there
are in the Royal Navy?”
Owen was silent.
“Do you suppose that Her Majesty is bound
to read letters from all those young gentlemen?
or from such of them as conceive themselves
aggrieved? It is most ridiculous! What is the
wrong you desired to complain of ?”
“If I did not even state it in my letter, I am
not likely to declare it here.”
The magistrate took off his spectacles with

severe amazement, and put them on again as if
he were putting on the judge's black cap.
“Have a care, young gentleman, don’t address
me in that manner. I sit here to administer
justice, and I beg you’ll answer all questions
respectfully that I may see fit to put to you.”
“I do not wish to be disrespectful, sir, but I
decline to answer that one question.”
“I see,” said the magistrate, looking once more
at the letter, “that you state yourself to be the
son of Captain Gaveston Brooke; is that the Cap-
tain Brooke who was implicated in the bubble
scheme of the Gwynfodd mining shares?”
The boy's lip quivered. “My father was one
of the victims of that scheme.”
“Humph! It is not very easy on these occasions
to find out who are the victims and who are the
victimised. Captain Brooke has lately gone
through the insolvent court, I think?”
“He has. He gave up all his property to meet
the demands upon him.”
“ Humph! I suppose your petition to Her

Majesty was connected with this business. I
understand you sent to your father?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Well—where is he * Why is he not here?”
“I do not know, sir.”
Owen spoke the words with difficulty. A choking
at his throat, a mist of tears—utterly unsuited to
a brave young officer who had saved eight lives
on the coast of Madagascar—came over him at
the thought of his father. Where, indeed, was
his father? What was happening at home? What
had happened to Beatrice?
The wistful, proud, and yet boyish look, softened
the formality of that Draco, “the sitting magis-
trate.” He bent forward and laid the severe
spectacles on his desk; but true to his habitual
magisterial impressions, he said, “I hope it is not
that you have been in so many scrapes before,
that your father does not choose to assist you on
the present occasion. Have you no other friend
who will attend and answer for you?”
“Not in London, sir.”

This also was said falteringly; for the question
brought to Owen a group of frank kindly cheerful
men and lads, officers on board his ship, who would
all have given their right hand to help him, had
they known he stood in need of help. His friends
and messmates—gallant friends—with whom he

man, with but one arm; General Pryce Perry,
— the same who was introduced to Beatrice
at the Marchioness's ball, . and whom Owen
recognised, having seen him at his father's
house the summer before. General Perry was
at the police-office to give evidence about The
Marchioness's coachman, who was accused of
“whipping in ” the night before. The old
soldier had once been very much in love with
Treherne's mother, Lady Jane, by whose family

he had been then most contemptuously repulsed;
but was now permitted, in right of his disappoint-
ment and romantic adherence to her memory, to
take all sorts of ill-requited trouble, and be at
the beck and bend of her sisters, as a sort of
Patito and useful family friend. If a safe lady's
horse was wanted, or a beautiful little dog,
General Perry looked about till the want was
supplied. When the little dog wanted a new
collar, General Perry saw that it was properly
engraved. When, in spite of the new collar,
or in consequence of the new collar, the little
dog was duly stolen, General Perry advertised
it, and called on the famous gunsmith who
knew all the dog-stealers. He was always ready
for the most trivial tasks and the most im-
portant services. To him the two ladies of fashion
seemed neither so worldly nor so selfish as to
others. They had a halo round their heads quite
independent of their diamonds. They were HER
sisters; the sisters of his dead lost love; for the
sake of whose loss he went to the wars, whence

he came back with but one arm; for the sake
of whose love he remained all his life long a
bachelor.
And now the thing he loved best in the world
was Helen Wollingham, for she was the one who
resembled most that vanished delicate beauty;
and Montagu Treherme, her son and living re-
presentative.
So General Perry was there (luckily for Owen)
doing The Marchioness's bidding; and after it had
been done, he took the midshipman away with
him, patting the boy kindly on the shoulder, and
bidding him think nothing of the magistrate's
last words,—pronounced with stern dignity and a
re-adjustment of the condemnatory spectacles;
bidding the young sailor “take care when next he
wore his arm in a sling, that it should be in the
Queen's service like the worthy General, rather
than in such senseless riotings.”
They reached Spring Gardens just as Captain
Brooke, accompanied by Maurice Lewellyn, was
preparing to come to the police-office. Captain

Brooke thanked General Perry with emotion; and
with a sadness which the General really thought
went beyond what the occasion warranted. Ma-
riana, too, looked the picture of fatigue and
dejection. She was always pale, but she looked,
now, like a statue upon a tomb.
The good-natured General lingered a little, with
the intention of proposing an evening at Vauxhall
to his midshipman friend, the fireworks at which,
he thought, would be more exhilarating than these
family countenances; but he did not know how
Captain Brooke might take it, and was still hesi-
tating as to his idea of subordination, when the
latter said,—“My boy, your disagreeable night
must, I am sorry to say, be followed by a very
brief farewell to us all, for Captain Gordon, who
is appointed to the ‘Ajax, desires you will join
him at the Admiralty at three o'clock, and you
are to accompany him out of town; you will
scarcely have time for preparation, as it is.”
“Well, well, perhaps that is the best thing for
him; get him back to his ship; get him back to

his ship; if he goes on as well as he has done
there, there is no fear of him.”
So saying, General Perry shook all kindly by
the hand,—and drove off to render an account
of his services to the most noble the Marchioness
of Updown.
Beatrice was not at home. She had not come

wished the interview or not. But Mr. Lewellyn,
with the irritable impatience common to invalids,
desired to cross at once instead of resting the
night at Dover, and Captain Brooke found only
Maurice, waiting the departure of the night mail
to return to London. They returned together.
Captain Brooke at first had held a certain reserve
with the young man, and declared he had only
come, “having business at Dover,” to get a clearer
opinion of the state of Beatrice's health than Sir

Bertie had had “courage” to give him; and
Maurice heard him with silent sympathy, for he
guessed something had occurred far more grievous,
though his father had not revealed the result of
his visit to Beatrice, nor had Maurice told either
of his parents that he had seen her at Treherne's
lodgings. Scarcely a word was exchanged during
the three hours spent on the railway; but when, on
arriving at his own home, Captain Brooke found
that his daughter was still absent, and that Owen
was in the hands of the police for the night, his
agitation was too great for reserve; he turned
wildly from the door, as if to seek her; then, as
the dreadful WHERE * presented itself, he seized
Maurice's hand and wrung it, exclaiming: “Your
father had better have told me the worst; she
said she was married; but we — we don't even

Maurice Lewellyn looked across him to the pale
face of Mariana. “I think,” he began; but he
would not finish. He would not say he thought
she might be at Treherne's house. He only said,

He was driven with all the speed of a double
fare to Stratton Street. He rang in vain once
or twice; the landlady heard, but could not leave
the suffering Beatrice; a third time he rang, and
the sleepy servant girl answered the summons
and his questions. “Mr. Treherne was not there;
he went into the country somewhere, in the early
part of the day, and had not since been in.”
If Maurice Lewellyn had waited in the clear
summer dawn but ten minutes longer, he would
have seen Treherme drive up to the door from
the ball and the Marchioness's; but he was
just ten minutes too early for that return. He
thought now all was clear. They had eloped.
Beatrice was there the evening before to give
consent and make arrangements. Could they be
married? Or were they gone to be married?
The provisions of Lord Caërlaverock's will were

thing rather disgraceful; but he vaguely knew
that Treherme was expected to marry one of the
Wollinghams, and that certainly a marriage with
penniless Beatrice Brooke would be to the last de-
gree irritating to his relations. Therefore, Mon-
tagu might desire to make it “a runaway match.”
Half grieved and half satisfied, he communicated
the result of his knowledge to Captain Brooke. He
begged him to be of good cheer, and said that his
belief was that Beatrice had eloped with Treherne.
Captain Brooke shook his head sadly. He knew all
that Lewellyn had not heard. The physician's visit;
the dreadful scene of yesterday; the condition of
Beatrice; the assurance that she was already
married; the promise that her husband should
come the day before to claim her. He acceded,
however, to Mariana's entreaty to “lie down and
rest till daytime; ” and Lewellyn promised to re-
turn and accompany him to the police-office.

the morning as he could, hope to find anyone up,
to Mr. Grey's. The acute solicitor had already
satisfied himself that Miss Brooke had never been
with the Brettons, for Dr. Bretton had passed
through London on his way home to Tenby, and
on pretext of speaking about the farm in Tuscany
which that gentleman had been so near purchas-
ing, Mr. Grey incidentally discovered all that he
wished to learn. Nor had Lady Eudocia failed,
“in the interest of her girls,” to communicate in
writing to the family lawyer, on her return from
the ball, the very disagreeable piece of news
carried to that place of entertainment by the
Marchioness—which intelligence, however par-
tially salved over by Treherne's solemn oath, left
her in a state of great anxiety, “as to the ma-
noeuvres of the young lady whom Mrs. Grey had,
doubtless with the best intentions, so very impru-
dently taken abroad with her.”

own rectitude; knowing his own interests at stake;
thinking hardly of women, and above all of their
insincerity, as exemplified in the only two women
with whom his busy life permitted him to be very
intimate, namely Mrs. Myra and Milly Nesdale,—
and having, indeed, that general disposition to
“believe the worst,” usual in, and consequent
upon, the exercise of the legal profession,—Lord
Carlaverock's solicitor was ill-disposed for sym-
pathy, when the weary old officer asked to see
him on business.
He bluntly told Captain Brooke, in reply to his
first cautious question,—that “he had reason to
believe there was some anxiety in both families
as to Miss Brooke and Mr. Montagu Treherne,”
that, “without entering into particulars” there
were reasons — family reasons — dependent on
certain provisions in the late Lord's will, that
made the idea of such a marriage impossible.

which he gave him every credit) had already—in

by giving a solemn declaration on oath that no
such marriage had taken place; and he hoped
that all idea of it would be abandoned.
Something he added, courteously enough, to the
downcast man before him, about the beauty of his
daughter, and the certainty of her enjoying the
attentions of many who might do him honour
as son-in-law. And something he added about
being a father himself, dependent on his pro-
fessional exertions for the maintenance of his
family; and the extreme hardship of “having his
relations imperilled with one of his noblest clients
and all the members of that distinguished family,”
by the imprudence or ambition of a young lady to
whom he had unwittingly offered an opportunity of
seeing Mr. Treherne at Venice, by permitting his
wife to take temporary charge of her abroad.
Nothing that a gentleman might not say (Mr.
Grey was always gentlemanlike), and nothing that
had not a certain degree of fairness in it.
Nothing but what would still, perhaps (as far

as Mr. Grey was concerned), have had a certain
degree of fairness in it, though with a very dif-
ferent aspect, had Captain Brooke known of the
great “scena” with Lord Caërlaverock; the hasty
relinquishment by Mrs. Myra of her temporary
charge of Miss Brooke, in favour of the Gouglo-
koff; the lonely evening when they left Beatrice
deserted in her hotel; the stormy voyage; the
dreadful fever; the marriage, in what the poor
girl believed to be the final hour of her life; im-
plored and insisted upon, not then as the fulfil-
ment of a passionate love-dream, but that he--
her father—when he got the news of her death,
should have no other sorrow to bear, linked with
her name; no shame in her memory !
Captain Brooke knew none of these circum-
stances; nor Owen; nor Mariana. They were to
have been told. They were what Beatrice relied
upon for pardon. But where was Beatrice?
Owen has joined his captain; Mariana is weep-
ing at home; Captain Brooke knows only that his

and that her supposed husband had solemnly
sworn she is not. Where is she where is his
lost girl? Where is his Pet of The Home? She
never named Treherne to her father. But he
knows she must be with him; that he—only he— -
can be the lover she declared was her husband.
He goes to that fatal door in Stratton Street.
But the landlady herself opens it now. She is on
the watch; she has received Treherne's instruc-
tions. The medical man he has called in says
Beatrice is on the verge of fever; the least agita-
tation may kill her. She is not to be told what
a weakly little atom her babe is, or that it is very
unlikely to live out the day. Even Treherne is
not to talk to her; the nurse is not to talk; only
to watch. They are in a quiet back room, dark
and silent.
Captain Brooke asks if “a young lady” has
been there since yesterday? The landlady says,
“No ; she has only gentlemen lodgers.” He tries
again: he * in a low voice, “I am the young
lady's FATHER.” There is a little agitated pause,

but she tells him it must be at some other house;
there are no lady lodgers here. Captain Brooke
asks for Mr. Treherne. He is not at home. Was
he at home yesterday? No; he was not at home
yesterday; he was at Putney all yesterday, and at
the ball at Belvidere House till five this morning.
At Putney ! At the ball! Can she be hidden
at Putney? At the ball till five this morning !
At the ball—with all this going on Captain
Brooke sighs, and turns from the door; he cannot
understand it. Can Beatrice only have with-
drawn from his anxiety and displeasure, till she
can fulfil her pledge and prove her marriage?
Is she not with Treherne after all ?
A watch is set on Treherne's house, but no
young lady is seen to go out or in; and Treherne
goes no more to Putney. He goes to his balls
and parties as usual. -

But no sign of life comes from Beatrice.
Captain Brooke looks very ill; and the term

Maurice Lewellyn urges him, with all earnestness
of reasoning that he can, to go back, as he had
settled, to Tenby; to The Home, with Mariana.
The young lawyer promises to watch and inquire
ceaselessly. He does not tell Captain Brooke what
Helen Wollingham told him,—that she was sure
some dreadful discussion took place about Beatrice
at the ball: that she herself heard Treherne
say: “Before God, and on the honour of agentle-

He does not tell Captain Brooke that his

had ever seen: had told him she had no doubt he
wished that, or any other ruin to Treherne, by
which he could himself reap pecuniary profit

That, for her part, she should not wonder if his
mother, her sister Dumpty, had plotted the whole
to benefit her own son at the expense of Eudocia's
daughters. (She was always backing up and
encouraging that vain forward puss, Beatrice.)

disappointments. Little or nothing of that sweet
Helen, who had stolen insensibly into his disap-

was banished from his pleasant readings with her,
and thrown once more on his lonely law-studies.
But he nerved himself to endure it without re-
gretting the words he had spoken for Beatrice.
He would not regret them; even though in his
secret soul he thought her frail,—remembering
how he himself had met her that night at Tre-
herne's, waiting for him. Evidently unexpected,
—for Treherne had asked him to come in and
smoke;—voluntarily, daringly there! Yet he
would not swerve from his idea of honour;
and if Treherne had betrayed this gentleman's
daughter, most assuredly he thought he ought to
marry her.
But Lady Eudocia stormed, and the Marchio-
mess sneered contemptuously, at the very thought
of such a marriage. And they rejoiced, with a
huge rejoicing, when, the morning after Owen

had not been caught by her plotting and du-
plicity! A nice thing it would have been
(setting aside all worldly considerations) to be
connected with such people; a family, no
one member of which could keep out of dis-
graceful scrapes. As to the boy, he would pro-
bably be cashiered the service, if his next prank
was at all like the last—and his father had only
himself to blame, for the way he brought them all
up. Even that quiet one, his step-daughter, had
a sort of independent way about her that was as
unlike a girl as it could be. Very often those
quiet ones were the worst; and, probably, if all
were known, she was no better than her sister.
Lady Eudocia could not sufficiently congratulate
herself on having put a stop to the senti-
mental friendship between her Helen and that
disreputable family; a friendship the poor child
had, in fact, been lured into by her Aunt Dumpty,
for purposes best known to herself.

fact that the royal party had been received with
even more enthusiastic cheering than ordinary,

Kindly fathers of families laid down the morn-

the boy ought to be hung at the lanyard, or top-

BEATRICE had what is called, in old nurses' par-
lance, “a dreadful bad recovery.” If her babe
had died, she probably would not have recovered
at all; for her whole soul seemed wrapt up in
that fragile existence. But it lived on, contrary
to expectation, with a weakly lingering sort of life.
It was a sickly-looking atom, with pretty features,
thin limbs, and large, sad, wandering eyes; but
Beatrice thought it the most lovely of created
beings, and clung to it with a cherishing tender-
ness. Even her first desponding misery about it,

revelation that Treherne and she were not “man

and wife,” was relieved by the ingenious falsehood
of her companion. Two great cheerful lies he
told her, with many a fond and pitiful caress.
Lie the first,-that he considered they were as
much married in the sight of Heaven, although
the person who read the words was not in orders,
as though a Bishop had consecrated the ceremony;
although it was not the sort of legal marriage
that would have justified his declaring it!
Lie the second, -that as soon as he was legally
of age, and master of his own destiny, a public
marriage would not only justify her, but, as a
matter of course, legitimate their son; that there
were hundreds of instances of secret marriages,
and marriages that legitimated offspring, all over
the world; and that a little patience, a little hope,
a little trust, were alone necessary to make life
bright again, after all the agitation and misery
they had endured.
They—for Treherne would not admit that he
had suffered less than Beatrice in the matter. He
drew such an exaggerated and frantic picture of

his own despair, when he opened the Venetian
casket and found she “renounced him” (as he
termed it), unless he immediately claimed her as
his wife:—of the loneliness in which he and she
would both have remained during the two years
of “widowhood and seclusion” she was to pass
with her father, and he in pining constancy away
from her:—of the torment the secret had been to
him, so nearly revealed when she comforted his
dejection when leaving Trieste:—of the fierce
opposition of his guardians and his family to his
dream of happiness.
He admitted so frankly that it would have been
nobler, better, wiser, to have waited his coming
of age, betrothed and trusting, instead of making
that hurried elopement with her from Venice,
—and appealed so irresistibly to her memory
of that time; of the notification of his grand-
father's will coming upon him “like a clap of
thunder” just when he had expected the very
sight of her would persuade his uncle to consent
to their marriage; of the fear he had, that

once parted they would be parted for ever;
and of the various “unfortunate incidents”
which had embarrassed him; making, as he
expressed it, “quite a web of his destiny: ”—he
drew such a vivid picture of her present position
in consequence of “the most unfortunate incident
of all,” her illness and non-return to her father's
house the night of the ball at Belvidere House:—
he so often and so vehemently repeated that if
he could have foreseen what his rash elopement at .
Venice would have led to, he would rather have
drowned himself by the Lido, than have persuaded
her to enter the gondola:—and he so mixed all
these vehement asseverations with the avowal
that regret was of no use, since now things could
not be otherwise, and if he were to shoot himself
it would not mend matters,—that he left on
Beatrice's mind rather the impression that they
were both victims of evil chances, than that she
had been just in reproaching him.
And if my readers think it positively ridiculous
to suppose that an educated girl of seventeen

cerned. Beatrice seemed to accept her position.
She did not distrust him. She did not worry
him. If she grieved heavily about her father, she
did not weep when Treherne was by. Indeed, he
could not bear weeping; and it was with a shade
of impatience that he begged her, on the last occa-
sion she gave way to tears in his presence, to con-
sider how very many marriages every day took
place, which even for worldly motives divided
families, and were afterwards forgiven.
For some time she hoped her father would
write, however angrily; but that happened in
this case which happens in many of these sad
occasions. Each thought the other voluntarily
silent. While Beatrice was hovering between life
and death, the unhappy Captain Brooke believed
her contumaciously determined not to reveal her
place of abode. He did not imagine her to be in
Treherne's house. That house had been watched
without result. A faint hope that her story of
the secret marriage was true, and that the diffi-
culties, whatever they were, which Mr. Grey had

sort of denial which the family had exaggerated
to the lawyer—combated in his heart the deadly
fear of her disgrace; but in either case she was
voluntarily absent—voluntarily silent!
Beatrice, on her part, remembering the painful
evening which preceded her departure from home
—the dreadful expression of her father's face
before she fell at his feet with the plaintive
assurance that she was married—the certainty
he must have felt that it could only be to
Treherne, and that he had only to communicate
with her by sending to Stratton Street—considered
herself renounced and cast off.
This impression was increased by a letter of
farewell from Owen, which the landlady of the
house had given her as soon as she seemed strong
enough; and which she said a young gentleman
had left with her the very morning after she came,
and though she told the young gentleman there
was no lady there, he persisted in leaving it,

his heart wrung and wounded; writing badly, not
because “in such haste,” but because his sprained
arm was nearly helpless; telling you nothing of
that police adventure; telling you nothing of his

you nothing but what he means for comfort;

his ship, he looks back with a groan to the spot
where he leaped so lightly ashore for his brief
home holiday.
But Owen has admitted that her father said—
“Don’t speak of Beatrice!” That is the sentence
that haunts her.

CHAPTER V.
MILLY NESDALE.
“DoN'T speak of Beatrice.” Yet Beatrice longed
to hear of them all: to know where and how they
were. Her anxiety of mind retarded her recovery,
and it was the middle of August before she was
even able to be lifted into an open carriage to
take a drive.
Often she had longed to ask the kindly landlady
to inquire about her father, but that was at once
to reveal who she was, and fix the great scandal
on his name. Treherne had told her he believed
they had left London, but she could not rest
satisfied in uncertainty; and one of the first days
she was able to go out, the carriage drew up at

the Duke of York's statue, and a ragged little lad
who was loitering about was beckoned to, and
despatched on a furtive message toSpring Gardens,
to know if Captain Brooke was still in town,
and how he was. The lad speedily returned,
“The old gentleman was gone away for good, and
there was the direction, if so be any letters were
written to him.” Beatrice looked at the well-
known address—“Captain Gaveston Brooke, The
Home, Tenby, South Wales,” and a heavy sigh
escaped her. They had gone, without once no-
ticing her existence! .
That very evening a letter was written to
Captain Brooke by Maurice Lewellyn. He said
he had at last seen Beatrice, as he was crossing
from Carlton Gardens to the Athenaeum; that she
looked pale, was in a well-appointed carriage, and
accompanied by an elderly female and an infant.
He said nothing more.
The next morning Treherne told Beatrice that
he thought of going to shoot in the Highlands;
that he had never in all his life been so late in

London, but that he “had made the sacrifice ’’
because he could not bear to leave her; and now,
he would like to take her with him. The diffi-
culty was the infant; would she leave that, with
the nurse somewhere by the sea-side for two or
three months?
What anxious startled eyes Beatrice lifted to
his face at this question | No; she could not
leave her baby—her delicate fragile baby. She
knew it would die, if she left it.
With an impatient sigh, Treherne yielded the
point; merely warning Beatrice that the nurse
and babe must rejoin her somewhere, for it was
utterly impossible they could travel with him.
“But they need not be in the carriage with
us?” said Beatrice, pleadingly.
Treherne shook his head. “They shall rejoin
you,” he said; and leaving her absorbed in a
dreamy contemplation of the large sad eyes of the
babe as it lay on her knee, he went to refresh his
spirits by calling on Lady Nesdale.
For during the last two months and more,

during which Beatrice had been weakly recover-
ing in her dull room; forbidden to talk much,
or read much, or sit up, or have the windows
opened in the chill of the evening, or the wax
lights too near her eyes at night — condemned
to lead the life of a hot-house flower; Treherne
had resumed what had been the constant habit
of his life,—till his sudden passion for Beatrice
broke through it,-namely, visiting daily at the
house of Milly Nesdale.
Even when Beatrice was in perfect health and
spirits, -enamoured as he was of her beauty,
enchanted with her singing, amused by her play-
fulness, greedy of her love, -there was something
wanting in the companionship between them
which Milly had, and Beatrice had not, Beatrice
was a thousand times more charming, but some-
how less suitable. - She knew nobody; had not
an idea who anyone was, or who was spoken of.
She had never heard politics talked in her life:
the prime minister and home secretary might
have been king of clubs and knave of diamonds

for any distinct notion she possessed of their
existence as men. All the subjects, places,
things, and people, connected with Treherne's
daily life, and possessing continual and hourly
interest for him, were blanks to her. “The
debate of the night before” might have been a
Sibyl's leaf for anything she understood of it.
The tracasseries and scandal which form the
larger portion of the conversation of the fashion-
able world, were to her, an unrevealed store of
chattering.
What Lady A. had said to Lord B. about the
beautiful but imprudent Mrs. C.; what chance
there was of a separation between P. and Q.; how
the old Marquis of G. had behaved in that busi-
ness; whether J. was in love with L.; or what the
real facts were, respecting “that shocking story
you know, my dear,”—was all like the sound of the
idle wind, “which roameth where it listeth,” to
Beatrice. Full of quickness, of earnestness, of pli-
ability, you might have made her understand the
world and its doings, its politics and its scandal, in

a month; but meanwhile she was innocent of any
such knowledge. You may build a saw-mill in a
fair meadow watered by a pleasant stream, fill it
with intricate machinery, and set that to grind,
and whirl,2nd chip, and divide, and plane, till
those who knew it formerly stand agape at the
change; but till you have done so, it remains
only a fair meadow; with the fresh stream run-
ning its own free course, the sweet cowslips
springing in the grass, the blue meadow butterflies
flitting over them, and “all its capabilities un-
improved.”
Beatrice had great “capabilities.” She was a
good historian, a good musician, a good arithme-
tician, a fair poet, a good linguist, a ready ac-
quirer of all that could be taught; but she was
not a woman of the world—nor even a girl of
the world. I doubt whether Milly Nesdale did
not know more of the world's doings, its gossipings,
its pursuits, and its vices, at eleven years old, than
ignorant Beatrice at this hour.
Now Treherne was essentially a man of the

world. He had no other existence than that
which merges in clubs, ball-rooms, parties, and
politics. Politics, not as a severe study of
different social systems, but as a matter of
House of Commons attendance, and voting, and
the rivalry of particular leaders. And Milly
Nesdale was a twin soul with him in these
things. *
And in another most material point she was a
twin soul. Montagu Treherne had no religion. The
landlady had said that it did one good to hear
Beatrice pray. Not only it inspired him with no
sympathy, but at the bottom of his heart he
thought “the whole thing absurd.” Now Milly
Nesdale, the half-bred Hindoo niece of the wily
Myra, also thought “the whole thing absurd.”
She believed in the Lord Jehovah about as much
as in the God Vishnu. She had no “superstitions”
or “prejudices.” She was not even like the hero
of one of Edmund About's graceful novels, of whom
it is said that though he did not believe in God, he
believed in Fridays; in luck, and spells, and all

those follies which the eloquent Abbé Dupanloup
declared God permits to influence the minds of the
most heathenish and sceptical, to show how neces-
sary some belief is to the human heart.
Milly believed in nothing except in herself,
and most profound was her self-adoration. She
devoutly believed she was the most charming of
human beings; she was convinced that she inspired
the most unconquerable attachments, and that all
other preferences or rivalries were mere “entan-
glements.” She was saved from much jealousy,
partly by this pleasant conviction, and partly by
not caring for the man so much as for the visible
and apparent conquest. She was little tempted,
and very shrewd. Unlike her aunt Myra, she
had always kept on the vantage side. Never
loving, she had always the power to lead or to
govern the men who became enamoured of her.
In general, she succeeded in evading any very
vehement claims on her regard, but where, as in
the case of Treherne, and one or two others, a
suitor resolved “not to be trifled with,” she

bought her conquest with her sin instead of her
coquetry, as she would have given a hundred
guineas for a shawl she could not buy for thirty.
She conducted these various intrigues with the
most audacious courage, and the most matchless
cunning. Like most persons of eastern extraction,
she had a positive pleasure in deceiving. Her
motto was the motto of famous old Harry
Vaughan, “Quinescit dissimulare, nescit vivere.”
The greater the need of stratagem, the greater the
amusement; and it was quite a waste of Milly's
abilities that she had such an affectionate trustful
husband, for she would have braved the most fiery,
and outwitted the most watchful.
Up to the time of Nesdale's father's death,
Milly Nesdale had “no carriage.” She would
not have had a carriage for the world. If she
wanted a drive, or to go to her parties, the hand-
somest equipages rolled to the door, and all
gauze and feathers or all furs and velvet, accord-
ing to the season, poverty-stricken Milly stept
lightly in. When she wanted, on the contrary, to

go out unobserved, then happy for Milly was the
“no carriage” system. She went, as she herself
laughingly expressed it, “hithering and thither-
ing;” she “rested in a shop,” she “got into a
cab,” and she managed matters so well (especially
when she went out with aunt Myra), that no one
could have told what became of Milly from one
day's end to another.
And how “the world” loved Milly !
She had the prettiest way of saying “she could
not afford” things, folding the palms of her slender
Hindoo hands over each other, as if clasping the
emptiness of fortune. Flowers in her drawing-
room window and balcony were things Milly
“could not afford,” neither could she “afford” a
box at the play or the opera. Yet somehow or
other she had more flowers and opera-boxes at
her disposal than any one, except the Marchioness
of Updown. Even now that Nesdale had suc-
ceeded to the title, she got all she could from
everyone, not from necessity, but from habit, and
because the predatory soul of the adventuress was

in her, as in her aunt Myra, and no change of
position would have extracted it out of either of
them.
She was not accomplished. She rather scorned
what are termed accomplishments, but she talked
well on a variety of subjects, she “read up” in all
reviews and papers with sedulous industry for
the topics of the day; and she had that puzzling
superficial scholarship common to almost all
women who have been educated by men, or lived
very much more amongst men than women.
The conversation of such women is composed of
a series of imperfect echoes from true and perfect
sounds.
With all this, Milly had, as her friends and
admirers expressed it, “something very taking in
her,” and certainly there was in her a very reso-
lute determination to take. She had an Eastern
prettiness too, though not a regular beauty like
aunt Myra, and no longer in the bloom of youth.
She was strange and foreign-looking; on entering
a crowded room, you remarked her more than

you might remark far more beautiful women.
She was also very graceful. Her body was as
lithe as the liana, and her soul was the soul of a
snake. Rampant, watchful, cautious, till a safe
noiseless spring and a sudden coil gave her her
prey.
Treherne was one of her great triumphs. She
had carried him off from a lovely Russian
Countess, younger sister of the very Gouglokoff
who had married old Lord Caérlaverock. Milly
had treated Montagu with very careless coquetry
up to the time that this bewitching foreigner
arrived in England; professing not to admire
him the least, “poor lad,” and saying of him
(what perhaps she thought) that he was
“selfish and inane.” But no sooner did she
perceive, with amazement, that her conquest was
comfortably transferring himself to the more easy
toils of the pink-complexioned beauty of St.
Petersburg, than her soul wound itself into a
very corkscrew of spiral coils, preparatory to the
final spring.

She came off victorious. In vain was the
Russian pinker, whiter, prettier, than even
other Russians of her fair complexion; in vain
had she her due and liberal portion of Rus-
sian craftiness; in vain was she really “in
love” with the handsome young Englishman who
had singled her out as an object of attention,
while Milly was only jealous and provoked.
Somehow or other, “hey ! pass!”—with the
Hindoo juggler's dexterity when he swallows a
sword and smiles,—the serpentine Milly repos-
sessed herself of the escaping heart, and left the
poor little pink and white huntress to pursue any
other game that might offer itself as a substitute
for her vanished adorer. * -
Only Milly had so far to pay forfeit, that it was
agreed by a little arrangement between the con-
tracting parties, that Treherne was “no longer to
be trifled with.”
And then followed really a delightful time for
Milly; calling forth all her powers of dissimula-
tion, and all her spirit of intrigue; for the Russian

ambassador, who had depended on the pink and
white huntress for information as to English
political secrets, or half-secrets, which he thought
so young a diplomat as Treherne was very
likely to communicate without even thinking
of their being betrayed; took it extremely ill
that Milly should undo the links whose riveting
he had been watching with some interest; while
Nesdale's ministerial uncles, having conceived very
nearly the same expectations (poor simple gentle-
men) as to the chances of the pink and white
woman conversing during the lull and pause of
more amatory discourse respecting the schemes of
the great Czar, and the treatment of “the Sick
Man,” whereby Treherne might not only become
enlightened himself, but the cause of enlighten-
ment to others, equally resented the revéche
conduct of their niece-in-law, who, with all the
London “world before her, where to choose,” went
out of her way to disturb and terminate a flirta-
tion so extremely apropos in the then state of
political affairs.

Therefore Milly was, as she sighingly expressed
it, “persecuted.” She told Treherne (for she
never loved till then, poor Milly had not) that she
“had no idea what a sorrowful trouble real love
was,” and that she felt “so jealous and restless
with all the world against poor little me,”—that
she made him send perpetual excuses to the Russian
ambassador, and to the ministerial uncles-in-law,
whenever the pink and white woman was to dine
with them; or she made him accept the invita-
tions, and then fail at the last minute from one
cause or another. Sometimes “he dar’n’t leave the
2
House, a division being expected; ” sometimes
“he was extremely indisposed;” sometimes “he
had mistaken the day, and made ten thousand
apologies;” and sometimes he came so very late
that he lost his natural place, and congregated
with the gentlemen at the end of the table, where
ladies were not, or at least not such chrysolites as
the fair Russian, and then he slipped away just
as coffee was brought upstairs, so that he might
as well not have come at all.

Till at last the Russian ambassador (being
of a superior and Russian wiliness) took to
asking Milly and Treherne as before, and the
pink woman also; and if by chance they all
met, he was especially urbane, and called them
“mes enfans,” and told stories, like Lord Caér-
laverock, (only with more point in them); and
paid great court to Milly, who was exceedingly
flattered, and said the Russian ambassador was
a man “of great intellectual capacity.”
But the ministerial uncles (being of an inferior
and English wiliness) set their wits against
Milly's wits; and even went so far as to tell
Nesdale (for the honour of the family) that her
conduct was “plus que coquette,” and he really
ought to go out with her, and make her
more circumspect, especially with regard to
that conceited young man, Lord Caérlaverock's
nephew !
Whereupon Milly went up in glad balloons
of inventive daring, and came down in parachütes
of the same; making so many contrivances for

meeting Treherne when and where she pleased,
that Ariadne's clue was a joke to it. She “went
out shopping,” and passed in at one shop en-
trance and out at the other, Heaven knows where.
She had “appointed to lunch with her cousin,” or
“sit with a sick friend,” and ready aunt Myra
took her away and set her down at those doors.
She went to study art at picture-exhibitions;
where she looked at one picture, and then
vanished. She took her poor children out, and
left them sitting under a shady tree with the
little French bonne, “till mamma came back.”
She went to country balls, and took rooms
in the hotel “because it was so far to drive
home: ”
or she went “quietly down into the
country for a couple of days,” and then walked
forth to contemplate tombs in a neighbour-
ing churchyard, till the whistle of the railway
engine told her that she need not wait many more
minutes without seeing Montagu appear. She
attended that political pretence, the “Ladies'
Gallery” in the House of Commons, and laughed

through the grille at her grave husband as he sat
dangling some local bill, before she folded her
lace mantilla closer round her and skipped away
with her lover. And seeing something wistful in
the eyeing of the outside of her notes and letters
by the perplexed Nesdale (disturbed by his uncles'
warnings), she took to corresponding in cipher in
the “Times.” For who was to tell that 53: 2: 1: 8
meant that she referred Treherne to the fifty-third
page, second line, of a book of which they kept
duplicate copies, for the settling of their next
project? or that a grave unintelligible sentence
apparently alluding to money affairs, was a note
of warning as to Nesdale's absence, or a direction
where to find a letter? And one of the pleasantest
and most amusing incidents Milly could remember
during this active period of slyness, occurred
one morning when, anxious to hear what had
been settled as early as possible, she said to her
husband across the breakfast table—“Give me at
least the advertisement sheet, you absorbed
reader?” and he, stretching out his arm without

ever looking off the leading article he was
perusing, handed her the paper with his thumb
exactly on Treherne's advertisement, as if he had
desired to point it out to her.
And all this time it never occurred to Treherne
that she, who was so cunning to others, was also
cunning to him; though on that special occasion
her anxiety was to know whether his appoint-
ment was to be kept—or another.
Nor was the interference of the ministerial
uncles of the smallest use, Checkmate to uncles,
checkmate to husband, checkmate to the pink
and white woman. The only result was, that for
some time afterwards, Nesdale called her “poor
dear Milly,” in speaking of her to his uncles, as
of an injured victim; and though he hated aunt
Myra and knew that aunt Myra hated him, and
laughed at him, and told everybody what a pity
it was that her charming niece should be thrown
away upon him, he interfered even less than
formerly with their drivings and suppings, from
a vague sense of having wronged Milly by

having allowed his uncles to speak disparagingly
of her.
And so Milly passed once more from the
state of active slyness, to the state of passive
slyness (which was infinitely less entertaining to
her); and she did exactly as she pleased; and made
a little saucy smile at the uncles when she
passed them in society leaning on Treherne's
arm. And the world in general delighted in
Milly, and always asked her to meet Treherne;
and so did every member of his family; though
they would have tied Beatrice up in a sack and
drowned her, were such a Bosphorus proceeding
possible on the borders of the civilised Thames.
For there is a little society in a corner called
“The Society for the Suppression of Vice;” but
there is a much larger society for its Protection:
and in that larger society Right and Wrong do
not signify,–but Success, or Non-Success.
Indescribably welcome therein, are women like

So Treherne called on Lady Nesdale; and spent
a remarkably pleasant couple of hours; and
patted Nesdale's little boy on the head, as though
he were the kindest friend his father had; and
sent him riding round the drawing-room on his
cane while he lounged in a chair listening to
Milly's autumnal plans, and settling a little
where they would go; for they were both in-
vited to the same country-houses in two or three
instances.
And a little later Milly had some entertaining
calls, from such persons as still lingered in
London. The Russian ambassador called; and
the Austrian and French ambassadresses; and

one or two other ladies, and several spruce and
agreeable attachés and secretaries; and General
Perry, with a good deal of news from “the
5
seat of war;” and the Marchioness of Updown,
—“ passing through London on her way to
Windsor Castle”—as she took care to repeat each
time a fresh visitor entered; and the author of
the last political pamphlet, with a very stern-
browed and clever-looking American friend, whom
he desired to introduce; and one of the baffled
ministerial uncles, who was very pleasant, too, in
his way. And there was much lively chat, and
brilliant discussion, and grave sentences and
laughing sentences. And the Austrian ambassa-
dress spoke the prettiest English in the world, and
the French ambassadress had on the prettiest
bonnet; and the gentlemen, young and old, were
all extremely flattering and conversable; and
Treherne felt himself très égayé in consequence,
as he assured a bright-eyed and laughing girl who
rose with her mother to take leave.
And now Milly's circle thinned again; and after

all the ladies had departed, and the principal
notabilities among the gentlemen, and only
a few lingering minnows of good society were
left swimming in that crystal pond,—Milly
dismissed the unimportant remnant of do-
nothings, by rising with a bewitching little half-
yawn, and the exclamation, “What a fatigue !
I have had quite a levée, et Dieu! quelle chaleur
étouffantel Now I must really go to get a little
fresh air. Bon jour, messieurs! bon jour, mes
amis! Good-bye, Mr. Treherne;”—and with an
English shake of the hands to Treherne, and
little adapted bows and smiles thrown among the
rest as a good housewife throws grain among the
chickens, and repeated here and there with em-
phasis as some especially gentlemanlike attaché
took his hat, clicked his heels together, and bowed
himself out of the apartment—the conqueror of
pink and white Russians was left alone.
Several of the do-nothing remnant went to
loiter in the park, with a vague hope of again
seeing the charmante Lady Nesdale, for town and

the chancelleries were getting extremely dull.
But Milly was too busy to drive in the park; she
was going shopping (really going shopping, this
time); she had her pretty little Balmoral boots
to get; and hats of various forms, with various
feathers; and a waterproof cloak, and other odds
and ends, which had been left to the last, after
all her morning dresses and evening dresses had
been tried on and completed and packed away
for her autumn “progress.” And she did all her
shopping very successfully, her spirits being “light
and nimble,” having had a very pleasant tri-
umphant afternoon, and ascertained Treherne's
plans, which somehow or other he had fidgeted
her by seeming chary hitherto of settling or re-
vealing; and he had remained so very late in town;
but that might be for policy, so much was doing
and fermenting among ministerial folk.
And Beatrice, too, made her simple prepara-
tions for departure, with many a downy covering
for “baby,” and many an adjuration to his nurse,
and feeling as if the separation from him for a

day or two was quite a dark gulf of time. Till
Treherne came home, gay and animated, looking
forward with great satisfaction to getting “at last”
out of hot empty London; and having so exactly
ascertained Milly's movements, that he was able
at once to settle how to avail himself of her
lively and amusing companionship at the houses
to which he would have gone at any rate
during the shooting season, and how to avoid
travelling by the same route or on the same day
to Scotland,—Beatrice being his companion.
So when Milly, and her boots, and hats, and
dresses, and cloaks, arrived on the Wednesday at
King's Cross Station for the Great Northern, no
Treherne was visible; though she did not step
into the carriage till the last moment, expecting,
as he knew her day of departure, that he
would appear as usual “quite accidentally” with
a new book and paper-knife in his hand: and she
felt the more provoked, as she had needlessly
deprived herself of legitimate attendance, by
advising Nesdale “instead of hurrying with

accounts and other little matters put off till the
last, to come on by the night mail.”
All which being known by experience to Tre-
herne, he gave Milly two days' start; and taking
an entire compartment for himself and Beatrice
in a Carlisle carriage on the Caledonian line, went
on the day afterwards to Edinburgh; knowing
Milly by that time past Dunkeld on her tour of
visits.
At Edinburgh he loitered a couple of days
more; amused by the enthusiasm and admiration
expressed by his companion for that most pic-
turesque of cities; by her eager way of talking
of the personages of history as if they were all
her intimate personal acquaintance; by her fervent
compassion for Mary Queen of Scots, which made
her look with moistened eyes on the sunny walls
of ruined Craigmillar.
Nay, he was glad, “though all this really
played the deuce with his shooting,” to have
consented to “waste another, afternoon” in the
lovely dell of Hawthornden, at Beatrice's earnest

petition, because Drummond of Hawthornden's
works were among aunt Dumpty's curious old
books, and because they had read him together
in those happy days at Tenby. Had Shakspeare
ever sat with his friend in that wild scenery,
Beatrice wondered? Who knows? Who shall say
where he sat and dreamt—that least known of all
celebrated men
Beatrice sat there, at all events, reciting many a
scrap of poetry, and legendary lore. There she was
in her element; there no Milly could rival her;
and although to Treherne these things were in-
different, she who spoke of them was the present
passion of his sensual heart, and he treated her
that day with an enamoured tenderness which
would have made aunt Myra's niece stand aghast
with wonder, if she could have witnessed it.
And seeing how fond Beatrice was of poetry
and romantic scenery, Treherne concluded that
the best home for her, with due regard to his
own convenience during the shooting season, was
the inn at Inversnaid on Loch Lomond.

with its thirty islands, and Craigroyston's rough
shelter. Well he knew the neighbouring Loch
Katrine, and lesser Ard, and the tiny lake of
Menteith. Thither he had brought the “first
love” of his selfish manhood,—one Mary Macvicar,
daughter to Lord Caérlaverock's steward, now a
struggling milliner in London. There he had met
Mrs. Hammond, a Maltese merchant's wife, whose
beauty he remembered even when with Beatrice,
—though he had rather drawn off from that ac-
quaintance, for he thought Mrs. Hammond was
“trifling with him.” And above all, there he
had been with Milly Nesdale, sometimes with a
“distinguished party” of ladies and gentlemen;
sometimes by stealth, with cunning delays of a
day, or a day and a half, or half a day,–when
her easy husband thought her passed on to her
next country-house visit, or settling the dear
children to bathe on the Clyde.
Here, indeed, he first saw Milly; and was flat-
tered by aunt Myra (through whom he made her

acquaintance), assuring him that he would “suit
her so well as a companion,” and that she was
“so thrown away upon Nesdale.” Vividly he
recollected one day at Menteith; when,—having
- rowed aCrOSS to the little island of Talla, and
emerging arm in arm with Milly from the
ruins there, — he suddenly and unexpectedly
met Maurice Lewellyn (seemingly fated to
meet him with his loves), and was struck by
the grave contempt of Lewellyn's bow to his
companion.
How nervous he had felt for her; and how
she had laughed at him, and hung on his
arm, and looked up in his face, quoting from
Lillie's Euphues:—“He that cannot dissemble
in love, is not worthy to live. I am of
this mind; that both might and malice, deceit
and treachery, perjury and impiety, may lawfully
be committed in love, which is lawless.” And
how, as they rowed to chestnut-shadowed Inch-
mahome, and the wily Hindoo smile still lingered
on Milly’s features, it seemed to him that he

had sold his soul to a species of charming water-
witch, rather than given his heart to a woman.
No scenery could be monotonous that was
visited with such a variety of company; and
while Treherne was taking his western shooting,
he left Beatrice at Inversnaid; and when he paid
more eastern visits, he moved her to Dunkeld;
and he very fairly divided his time between
enamoured visits to this Rosamond, and a sedu-
lous attention to grouse shooting and Milly
Nesdale.
The autumn passed off charmingly for all
parties. Beatrice, though she had fits of excessive
dejection about her father, and his silent renun-
ciation of her—though she was for ever notching
off days from the two years, like a poor prisoner,
by staring for the hundredth time at the date of
Montagu's birthday in her pocket-book,-yet for
the most part held a sweet and cheerful humour
with Treherne.
She adored her baby; recovered her health;
bloomed once more with the English colour whose

loss had made her so like her Italian mother; sang
once more with the rich clear voice whose sound
Treherne, who was fond of music, had exceedingly
missed; and never asked a fraction more than he
pleased to tell her, of how he employed his time,
or who he saw; nor moaned and worried, beyond
now and then saying, with a smile and a sigh,
“Well! in two summers more, I suppose I shall
see some of these people with you!”
Milly Nesdale was likewise perfectly satisfied.
She had spent her time entirely to her own liking,
and been extremely fétéd and admired at all her
visits. She had given what a quaint old chronicler
calls “ the privy nip, or open flout,” to every
woman who presumed to interfere with, or attempt
to rival her. She had triumphed in observing
that the most beautiful girls, attended by the
most skilful chaperons, appeared no more to
inspire Treherne with the idea of marrying, than
if he had taken the vow of celibacy as a Knight
of Malta; and instead of wandering away to
Tenby and Venice, and Heaven knows where, as

during the last two autumns, he had spent his time
as a gentleman should, in attending to her. In
shooting, fishing, playing whist, dancing, riding,
and joining in “les jeux innocens,” by which
people at country-houses are wont to beguile the
unoccupied evenings.
The nearest approach she had ever made to
love in her life, was her liking for Treherne, and
she was extremely vain of her supposed pri-
soner. His good looks, good manners, and
good connections, caused many to envy her,
and, if there was one thing Milly delighted in
more than another, it was being envied. As to
the members of Treherne's family, they coaxed
and loved her more than ever: for they all thought
she was the best “occupation” he could possibly
find. Even Lady Eudocia was no exception; for
that moral mother considered, first, that Helen
did not seem to be thinking of him or he of her,
and really Helen's health was so delicate she began
to think she might not live; and secondly, her
next daughter was scarcely old enough to come

out, and anything was better than Montagu being
entangled meanwhile (as he was near being with
that Brooke girl), into MARRIAGE. Let him
attend to Milly. If Milly's husband was a fool,
as aunt Myra called him, or a blind buzzard, as
the Marchioness called him, that was nothing to
them. Milly knew her own affairs best; trust her
for managing them; and trust her, too, for not
risking her position. They had devout confidence
in her as a thorough woman of the world. If
Treherne married one of the Wollingham girls,
they knew beforehand with what tact Milly would
fade into being Treherne's “friend.” None of your
vulgar regrets and sadnesses, and calling the
world's attention to the past, but a proper fashion-
able carelessness; a carelessness calculated to make
all but the initiated really feel puzzled and doubt-
ful whether they had not all along been mistaken
as to the degree of intimacy which had subsisted
between the parties. And Milly so far deserved
the confidence reposed in her by the moral
family, that if—to do full justice to the depth of

her sentiment for Treherne—she did not exactly
feel with respect to him “as lief soon as syne,”
yet she took instinctively the true worldly view,
and vaguely anticipated that their union must end
“some day or other, as these things always did.”
Some day or other: no need to look forward.
Some day or other leaving her still with her title,
her position, her reputation, her husband, her
children, and her fashionable friends. To Beatrice
Treherne was all in all. To Milly Nesdale, he
was one triumph among many triumphs; one
extra pleasure among a thousand pleasures: and
his withdrawal would be a passing cloud—not a
blank night of despair.
Meanwhile, everyone returned to town in the
best possible humour. And even when Treherne
thought it “right and necessary to avoid re-
mark” by making some brief Christmas and New
Year visitings,—Beatrice, absorbed in her baby,
and believing in the necessity, remained cheerfully
patient. There was a sort of hesitation at first in
her lover's mind, whether he would not find her a

little cottage out of town, or in some of the
suburban terraces which fringe the metropolis;
for now she was well and able to go out, it was
more awkward for her to continue residing where
an evil chance had thrown her. But on con-
sideration he gave up the scheme. His income
was narrow, his friends on the watch, his time
much occupied, she never had known more than
one or two persons in London, or been to more
than one or two balls; her family were in Wales;
she had her apartments on the ground floor; and
on the whole, it was less likely to create com-
ment that she should remain so, than if he had
established a household on ever so moderate a scale,
and driven down in his smart cab to visit her.
Beatrice herself, too, was alarmed at the prospect
of the sort of loneliness and exile such a plan
seemed to promise; and though she fretted a little
at still having to observe “les convenances,” in
not going out with Treherne, but with her nurse
and baby except on rare occasions, late, when
they were not likely to be seen; and though she

thought it hard she could not take the arm of her
own husband, as other young married women did,
and walk openly with him, or visit with him in the
country, -still all this was temporary; and the
matchless destiny of being his acknowledged wife,
though she had walked the path to it through
thorns, would compensate for all. If she had had:
many acquaintances, and they had all cut her, her
position might have been made more apparent to
her; but she had scarcely known any but mem-
bers of Treherne's family and her own. Her
separation from the former had already been
almost complete, from Lady Diana's absence and
Lady Eudocia’s “dropping” the Brooke family.
She missed only her father and Mariana; she
could easily have borne the rest.
And Treherne missed nothing; he was as fétéd,
popular, and comfortable, as at any other period
of his life. There was a sort of “bruit Sowrd ”
that there had been some “row” about some
young girl “of very respectable parentage,”
whom his family had had great difficulty in pre-

venting his throwing himself away upon: for if
several people in several different places take to
discussing a subject by word or by letter, there
must be some such result. But there was no-
thing that the least interfered with Treherne's
comfort. He would not reckon (or if he did, it
was to pooh-pooh it with a scornful smile) the
conduct of Maurice Lewellyn, who, if he did not
actually “cut” his brilliant cousin, behaved in a
manner that fell very little short of that measure.
He never called again in Stratton Street after
that evening when he had seen Beatrice there:
He never spoke to Treherne; the faint grave
salutation, if they accidentally met, hardly
amounted to a bow; he never shook hands again.
But they met very rarely indeed. Treherne lived:
in the most outré circle of fashion and politics–
the crème de la crème. Maurice was studying
hard for the profession of the law; his general set
of acquaintances was different; and anyone who
has lived much in London knows how possible it
is to live without ever meeting, even among re-

lations not in “the same set.” Treherne con-
tented himself with a sort of uneasy sneer: “So
like his mother; so like my aunt Di, setting up
to judge other people's affairs; rather amusing,
too, being cut by my cousin, the doctor's son—
çnsequential fellow !”
Yet Treherne did not in his heart think it very
amusing. And young Maurice Lewellyn,-having
cut his gay companionable relative, and being all
but exiled himself from the house of Lady
Eudocia, and left to sigh over the memory of the
pink flush of welcome on Helen's smiling cheek,
when her “Reader,” as she called him, entered
with his pleasant volume; having lost the ever-
delightful companionship of his mother and his
intellectual father by their present residence
abroad; and having witnessed the misery of kindly
Captain Brooke, the friend of his boyhood, and the
degradation (as he believed) of the sister of pure
saint-like Mariana; Maurice Lewellyn became.

So things went on; and parliament met, and
London “filled,” and more wheels went racketing
through the streets, and more people walked to
and fro on the pavements, and more and more
double raps were heard at all the street doors, all
day long, but especially at dinner time. Busy
town-gardeners raked and gravelled the sooty
squares, and set crocuses and jonquils here

scrimped hawthorns. Black-stemmed trees, stand-

CHAPTER VII.
TREHERNE NOT A DOMESTIC CHARACTER.
IT was on one of the pleasantest of these days
of scrubby attempts at spring—one of those days
when really there is somehow a consciousness
in the air; as of bulb-roots breaking through
mould, and primroses looking down from hedge-
rows on fresh streamlets, and moss, and grass, and
by-paths, and a better condition of nature cer-
tainly going on somewhere, though not exactly
here in London. One of those days when even
in cities (yea, in the dullest yard or closest work-
shop of their walled-in places) there comes to us
as it were a mysterious instinct that the sap of
life is astir in this fair and misused world of ours;

and we call it “the feeling of spring,” and think it
sweet and comforting—like the sense of God's
mercy to pious hearts dwelling in privation, after
a morning prayer.
It was, I say, on one of these days, that
Beatrice's baby was taken very ill.
She had walked out with him in the morning,
and thought him heavy and languid in the nurse's
arms, and carried him a little way herself, talking
with smiles and endearments, and in that sweet
language which mothers use. And now she
was seated opposite to the nurse, who held him in
her lap, practising to her guitar one of Gordi-
giani's perfect ballads; and smiling at him while
she sang, fancying that even to him the melody
gave pleasure. His large wandering eyes were
fixed upon hers—he seemed to be listening; sud-
denly some inexplicable expression passed over
his face; and before the frightened exclamation,
“Oh! nurse, look!” had passed Beatrice's lips,
the child was in strong convulsions.
The woman comforted the terrified young

mother with assurances that it was “nothing
dangerous; that she had not mentioned it, but he
had had a fit before; that he wasn't so strong as
some children, but nothing to hurt:” the reme-
dies her experience suggested were applied, and
the alarm of the hour was over.
Then, when she saw her baby asleep (in a real
sleep, instead of the sleep of death, as Beatrice
had momentarily expected), she flew upstairs to
Treherne's apartment to tell him what had
occurred. He started: “My own dear Beatrice,
you must really take care; if you had come
three minutes sooner, you would have found
General Perry and young Count Freiligrath here.
I would have come down to you. What is
it?”
“The baby—my blessed child—he has been so
fearfully ill!” -
“Well, dearest; but you must not let those sort
of things deprive you of your presence of mind;
you must remember—”
“Oh, Montagu ! I have been so terrified;

I thought you would be sorry for him—for me.
I thought you would come down and look at him;
he is sleeping very quietly now.”
“So I am sorry for you, darling, and I will
come down and sit a little with you the moment I
have finished my letters for post; before I go out
for my ride. It is such a fine day, we are going to
ride to Wimbledon or Richmond; and I was
coming at all events to your room to tell you,
because we may perhaps dine before we return,
and I wished to prevent your waiting for me.
But do send for me, instead of coming, another
time!” And with a tender coaxing embrace,
Treherme dismissed Beatrice downstairs.
“Another time.” He did not seem the least
frightened or anxious: but nurse had said that
men knew nothing about babies, and seldom
cared for them. Beatrice sighed. Her spirits
had been so discomposed that she would have
given the world that Montagu could have stayed
with her a little; walked with her; and not been
engaged to ride and to dine. She dreaded the

long evening. What if baby should have another
fit 7 Perhaps—perhaps Treherne would consider
that; he was in a great hurry finishing his letters
when he spoke to her; he would be more at
leisure when he came down.
But Treherne was not “more at leisure; ” on
the contrary, he was very much hurried. He had
“driven it to the last moment,” and his horse was
at the door; he could not keep the party waiting;
they were to meet at the entrance of the ride in
Hyde Park, and he must be off. He bent over
the baby's crib for a moment, and said he hoped
all was right; that he looked, as far as he could
judge, “much as usual; ” that he believed these
little creatures very often had fits. And then he
told Beatrice that he thought she was too much
alone; and therefore,—Beatrice thought he was
going to say, therefore he would not dine out—
but he said therefore, as Count Freiligrath had
been telling him about a German lady who had
missed a situation as governess which she came
to England on purpose to fill, and would be glad

to teach her own language, and read with anyone,
would Beatrice like to engage her?
No ; Beatrice did not wish it. She knew German
pretty well; she could write it almost as well as
Italian and French; and she did not need any
companion.
“Except you, dear!” she said, as he took his
riding whip and hat off the chair where he had
laid them; and she looked wistfully up in his face.
“Well, to-morrow is Saturday and no House,
and we will dine and go to the opera together.”
To-morrow: not to-day. Certainly not this
evening, however dispirited Beatrice felt; and she
sighed again, even looking to to-morrow's opera;
for even there (and rarely she went) she had to
sit “in hiding,” with the curtain carefully drawn
across her side of the box. And so she looked
once more for the millionth time at her pocket-
book and notched off her days, and cheered her-
self with the certainty that little more than thirteen
months now intervened before Montagu's twenty-
sixth birthday.

But in the evening baby had another fit, and
Beatrice had another phase of alarm. And from
that time the leading thought of her mind be-
came “how baby was.” Insomuch that Treherne
told her—half in discontented jest, and half in
earnest—that he thought she was fonder of the
child than of himself. But she was indeed, as he
had said, “too much alone,” and the long hours
of solitary brooding made her feelings morbid.
She felt her loneliness, too, in this respect. Her
communing about her child was entirely with the
nurse, or the kindly landlady. No young matrons
came to see Beatrice: no one asked, with the
natural sympathy of sex and age, news of her
darling. No smiling mothers gathered round with
pretty rivalry, taking off the hats of their silky-
haired rosy babes, comparing curls and eyelashes
and the dimpled fatness of tiny hands, and
chatting with her of how soon the little pearly
teeth appeared, and how soon their marvels had said
PAPA! “quite distinctly.” All that happy gossip
of youthful wives, was a silent blank to Beatrice.

Having but one heart to sympathise with her,
she drew largely on its patience—too largely, the
heart being Treherne's. She wearied him with
the ceaseless fears and tremors, hopes and doubts,
insistings on his “judging for himself how baby
seemed,” and perpetual repetitions of what the
nurse, the doctor, or the landlady had said with
respect to him, and what had occurred in a
hundred other cases to other infants similarly
afflicted. She interrupted Treherne in narrations
of what interested him, with information that baby
had or had not eaten his dinner that day with
appetite. Twice when Montagu proposed to drive
her into the country, she “feared to leave her
little one alone so long.”
All this bored Treherne to death. Perhaps
under no circumstances would he have been a
tender father, but as it was, it was not too much
to say, that he felt towards “little Frank” no-
thing but the extremest aversion and repugnance.
Sometimes, when he was struck by the extra-
ordinary beauty of Beatrice as she held the poor

little thing in her arms; by the expression of her
face, the grace of her figure, more lovely than all
the Madonnas he had ever seen in all the galleries
in Europe, the fever of passionate admiration beat
as quickly in Treherne's pulse as in the earliest
days of his wooing. But passion is not affection;
as the wild and dreadful stories of our police-
courts may testify; where murder often blots out
the misnomer of LOVE, or some starving girl carries
her workhouse-born infant to the presence of her
seducer, and is turned away to despair and death.
Passion is not affection. Perhaps the reason why
that appeal “for the sake of the past” has less in-
fluence with the sterner sex than with women, is that
(allowing for exceptions), affection is the root of
love in women, and passion is the root of love in
men. The selfish brutality of some men to women
they have ceased to “love,” is something quite
inconceivable. And that without reference to
desert. It is not the flinging off the toils of the
worthless when the hour of passion is over,-for
the purest and most innocent-hearted women

have had this fate to endure. But till we have
ceased to stumble over a great mystery at the
very threshold of the temple of love; and to insist
on accounting with a great reasonable WHY for
apparently inexplicable fancies or forsakings, by
analysing the merits or demerits of the object of
preference, we shall continue to wonder and to
blunder. For it is not in the merit of the person
beloved that the secret of constancy lies, so much
as in the nature of the person loving. Once
admit that fact, and we cease to marvel at the in-
fatuated clinging to some Manon Lescaut, and
the forsaken anguish of a Louise de la Vallière; at
the patient tenderness of wives with worthless
husbands, and the enduring generosity of husbands
with heartless wives; at the ever-shifting sen-
suality of some “Bluff King Harry” in whom the
flame of love was but the grosser torch of desire;
or at the fanciful pursuit of the “riso angelico’
by some poetical Petrarch.
There are men to whom constancy is an un-
known feeling, and Treherne was one of them.

Of the two emblematic gods of the heathen fable,
Eros and Anteros, he knew only the earthly deity.
He was already beginning to be a little “tired”
of Beatrice—tired of the monotony that sur-
rounded her. He was rather dissatisfied at finding
himself so relieved and amused at Milly Nesdale's;
but he never reflected that he had there the
united conversation of all sorts of clever men and
clever women, instead of the single-handed at-
tempt to amuse him made by Beatrice, with her
books, music, and poetry, and blank ignorance
of all else in his world. He merely felt ‘bored,’
and resumed his habit of daily visiting there and
elsewhere; and dining out wherever and when-
ever it suited him to do so.
Milly shewed, too, an extreme disposition to
flirt with Herr Freiligrath, who was related
to the poet of that name, and was a young
man of singular good looks, and clever eager
conversation; and her flirting revived a sort of

a chorus of other laughers, to attend to him

I did not hear you,” was a far more considerable
woman than Beatrice, listening to every syllable
he uttered, watching his every glance for the
mood of the hour, colouring her own mood from

eternal silence “d dewa: ” which made the atmo-

balls, dressed with the most perfect and irre-
proachable taste (the only quality irreproachable

had received the morning we have mentioned,
when Treherne was so “égayé” and as she re-

these changeful phases of Milly's shining, gave
her a vast superiority over home-staying lonely

The sterner sex have a very scornful mode of
alluding to the dazzling effect of the military
profession on young ladies, and their weakness
for “a red coat, a military band, and fellows in
uniform:” but there are uniforms of gauze and
velvet, and bands whose music consists of the
buzz of flattery, which might be proved to be
quite as bewildering to the lords of creation.

To the shallow, the vain, and the sensual, the

than the woman herself. One woman has often
“cut another out,” whose superiority, if dissected
and analysed, would be found to be composed of
the carriage that whirled her up to the door, the
nimble footman who rapped at it, the soft
carpet on the handsome staircase, the drawing-

tree is marked to be cut down in a plantation;
and meanwhile he amused himself by calling on
her occasionally, and found a certain charm (the
charm of novelty) even in her undeniable provin-
cialisms and vulgarity. He smiled when she
dropped an “h” as if she had spoken the pretty
broken English of some graceful foreigner; and
her “ways” entertained him; more than Beatrice's,
who was simply simple, not vulgar; and more
than Milly's, who if she was “coquette raffinée,”
was so according to all rules and observances of
fashionable life; such as he had been accustomed
to ever since his puppy eyes opened upon his
worldly world, and which had therefore nothing
salient in it, or enticing.
But meanwhile, what with Milly, and what
with Mrs. Hammond, and engagements in political
and social circles, Treherne was so excessively
occupied, and so much absent from “home,” that

gradually Beatrice became conscious of a com-
fortless, forsaken, chilled feeling; like one who
wakes from being too lightly covered on a winter's
night. Even the Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and
Sundays, when there was no House of Commons,
no longer, as at first, secured Treherne's presence
in her apartment; and as to the evening walks
which had been such a joy to her, they were quite
a thing of the past.
One of those small incidents too, which rouse
people to a keener observance of the feelings of
those with whom they associate, than the incidents
themselves seemed to warrant, occurred about
this time. Beatrice had not seen Treherne since
the preceding day; he had gone out early, very
early, saying he thought of speaking on the
question before the House that evening, and
would “look up” the subject at his club. She did
not know when he had returned. She had been
looking for the debate next morning in the paper,
when he came in ; and as he took it, and ran his
eye over it after their first greeting, she said:

“What is the meaning of the expression “the
House was counted out?’” Treherne was glancing
eagerly at an article on diplomatic salaries and
reforms; he answered without looking up: “It
means that there were not members enough to
make a House—that there was no House.”
The colour flushed in Beatrice's cheek. “But
then—but then you were — not in the House
at all ?”
“No, of course not; indeed I foresaw it would
be counted out.”
“Where were you, Montagu ?”
The tone in which Beatrice said this, startled
Treherne to consciousness; he looked off the
paper, rather discomposed at the emotion visible
in her face. “I was—I had engagements;” said
he, impatiently.
He looked back to his paper. Beatrice did not
speak. After running his eye down the column,
he threw the paper aside and rose. “My dear
Beatrice, how very foolish; if you want to know
where I was, I am quite willing to tell you.”

“No ; it is sufficient that you were not here;
that you could have come, and preferred being
away. I have seen you lately less — and less-
and less—” and Beatrice burst into tears.
Something. of self-reproach, and still more of
dislike to a scene, mingled with Treherne's pas-
sionate admiration for Beatrice's beauty as she
stood before him flushed and tearful, with quiver-
ing lips and kindled eye. He caressed her; he
soothed her; he spoke all sorts of coaxing
comfortable words; he told her he had come
on purpose to take her with him to spend the
summer day in Windsor Park, which she had
neWer Seen.
And Beatrice dried her tears, and smiled, and
went; and while they wandered among the oaks
of Windsor, and rowed on the river by Eton,
she repeated by heart the whole of Gray's
famous ode; and the lovely sunset glowed and
faded, and the soft moon came out and shone
serenely on their homeward drive, and Beatrice
set it down among other blessed evenings of

love, and peace, and tenderness; and smiled in her
sleep as dreams brought her back the river, the
“antique towers,” and the “watery glade,” —
and woke hopeful and re-assured.
They would have few separate engagements
when once she was acknowledged as his wife; and
he loved her so tenderly She ought to be
contented.
But again there came blank days; disturbed
doubtful days; and again there came oc-
casions on which a sort of instinct told her
that Treherne was somehow “excusing” him-
self from the opportunity of being with her.
He went to the House, on one of these days,
telling her the debate would probably occupy
all the evening, and that he would dine at his
Club.
She tried to occupy herself. She tried to sing.
She took out her drawing. She attempted to read.
But the restless beat at her heart seemed
answered, like the pendulum of a clock, by the
aching pulse in her brain; and she called to

the nurse to accompany her in a walk, for she
thought the air would do her good.
Through the Green Park, past the gambols of
children, and the sauntering of friendly groups;
through that garden so dusty and unrefreshing
after its momentary spring; down the broad dull
street that leads to Westminster Abbey, -and,
after a hesitating pause, across to Westminster
Bridge. To look down on the water seemed a
sort of quenching of some internal thirst. She
stood on the bridge a few minutes, and looked
thoughtfully towards the stately Houses of Par-
liament. The nurse rested the little one on the
parapet, and said—
“We must take care Master Frank does not
take cold.”
Beatrice turned suddenly.
“Oh yes; let us go: how thoughtless of me to
come here !”
But as she turned, a carriage drove rapidly
past, and she saw–Treherne ! She was sure of
it, though only his golden hair and cheek, pressed

against the cheek of a curly-headed child with
whom he was romping, were visible. As they
passed, the child with a laugh flung a glove, one of
Treherne's gloves, out of the carriage-window; a
lady's voice said “Naughty!” a hand pulled the
check-string, and Treherne put his head out of
the window, saying: —
“Oh no, it is not worth while; the boys will
lose the beginning. Go on—Astley’s.”
It was Treherne. Caressing, playing with a
child. Whose child?—he that never played with
little Frank! It was his glove; Beatrice stooped
and picked it up. The nurse was looking at the
steamboats shooting down the river, and prattling
to baby. -
“We will go home now,” Beatrice said.
As they crossed by Canning's statue, she saw
the gentlemen who were members of the House
crowding from it in walking groups, or mounting
their horses, or called for by wives and daughters.
The House was “up.” Some one, as she looked

anxiously over the road to see if baby might cross
safely, exclaimed eagerly to his companion—
“Oh ! what a beautiful girl! what a glorious
face | *
And Beatrice had that first dull dreadful sense
of the valuelessness of abstract advantages,—of the
being beautiful in vain,—which has bitterness
enough in it to comfort the ugly for the most
mortified days they can ever spend.

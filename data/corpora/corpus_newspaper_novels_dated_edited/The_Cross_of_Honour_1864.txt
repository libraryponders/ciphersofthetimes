CHAPTER I.
A SON OF THE EMERALD ISLE IS GREETED WITH A
vERY PROPER ENTHUSIASM, AND RESPONDs Ac-
CORDINGLY.
THERE was but small variation, scarcely the sha-
dow of turning indeed, in the routine Captain Con-
stable had observed every morning since—eight-
een and a half years ago now—he had first come to
reside at Broome. He was in the habit of ring-
ing for hot water at eight, of emerging from his
bedroom at half-past, and of pacing up and down
the hall in wet weather, the garden in dry; tak-
ing his quarter-deck walks, with a pipe between
“his gills” as he called it, for the space of
twenty minutes exactly. At the expiration of
those twenty minutes, his daughter would come
bounding down the stairs with the sort of haste a
daughter is apt to exhibit before a punctual
papa, and apprise him that breakfast would be
ready in a minute.

8 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
For the last eighteen and a half years, Captain
Constable had done these things with unbroken
regularity, to the best of the belief of the inhabi-
tants of Broome. Even when delicate Mrs.
Constable existed—for that period that was com-
posed of equal portions of blanket and bed, bear-
skin and sofa, could not be called a life—even
while she existed, Captain Constable had smoked
his matutinal pipe of strong tobacco, and “so,
no doubt,” they kindly added, “had hastened
her end, poor lamb.” -
He had come to live at Broome when that stag-
nant time in the navy commenced, when the war
was over, and the peace was setting in with
severity for those who were attempting to solve
that facetious and unsolvable problem the Ad-
miralty set them, of whether a man could live on
his half-pay or not. -
Broome had three attractions for him; it had
a fine bracing sea-air, and this he deemed good
for always-ailing, consumptive, rheumatic Mrs.
Constable, whose life was one continued apology
to healthier humanity—it was so deprecating in
its sickness and suffering. It was sufficiently
out of the way for him not to have large doses
of that naval society in the which he would have
talked up his grievances as to prize-money, pro-
motions, and so forth, until they assumed the
gigantic proportions of wrongs—and he was wise

enough to desire to avoid this latter thing. And
thirdly and lastly, rent was low enough in those
regions for him to take a house such as it be-
hooved a gentleman of such ancient lineage to
dwell in, without his whole income going, as he
said, in the roof that covered him.
So, here, in this quiet, out-of-the-world little
village, he had lived for the last eighteen years;
alone with his daughter for the last ten—Mrs.
Constable's existence having ended just so long
ago.
He was a fine specimen of the old school of
naval officers; by which I must not be under-
stood to mean the roughs of the service at all,
but of that school of which Captain Marryat was
so glorious a type.
Captain Constable—they always gave him the
courtesy title, though he was only a commander
—was a tall, stalwart man, with fine brown hair,
in which not a thread of silver could yet be de-
tected. He had a firm, upright figure, which
gave you neither the idea of stoutness nor slight-
ness, so fairly was it proportioned. He had a
rapid habit of gesture and utterance; a frank,
cordial bearing to all alike, peer or peasant, that
at the slightest approach to aught like undue
familiarity, could become crushingly cold and
haughty, and still seem to suit him best. e

might be going on that promised amusement;
and last, and very far from least, he had a most
exquisitely pretty daughter.
Beatrice Constable had a rare grace and charm
about her, truly; for it not only bewitched you
into the mistake of thinking her lovely at first
sight, but it kept you on the same track ever
after—kept you on in your mistake, though at
the same time you could not be blind to the fact
of her complexion being a shade darker than it
is befitting the complexion of a daughter of
Albion to be. Though you could not be ob-
livious to the retroussé nose, which is only allow-
able in a blonde, still you could not do anything
but admire that sympathetic little nose. Her fore-
head too !—what was it about the girl's forehead
that made you look at it again and again? It
was not wide; it was not in the least like mar-
ble; on the contrary, it was immensely mobile,
and—but, perhaps, in this last lay its charm.
There was a line across it when she would be
thinking, that was not a frown; it would cross
her brow whenever she was anxious, or sorry, or
sad, or, indeed, acutely interested. It was a line
to mar the beauty of a more perfect forehead
than hers; but, for all that, if perchance you
valued intellect higher than loveliness, you would
have admired it.
This morning, when Beatrice cleared the last

three or four steps with a spring that brought her
face to face with her father, she would have been
surprised—if he had allowed her time to be any-
thing—by the unusual spectacle of his mouth
unadorned by a pipe.
“Good morning, papa,” she began, hurriedly;
“am I later than usual?—I am so sorry; or has
anything else put your pipe out?”
Captain Constable kissed his daughter in a
hazily meditative manner, that was a new thing
to him. “How many years is it—you’ve heard
me say often—since I heard from my sister last,
Beatrice?”
“Oh I ages before I was born ; seven-and-
twenty, I think; why, papa?”
“Well, my dear, you asked me if anything had
put my pipe out; this has rather—this letter that
comes from the sister Iparted with coldly twenty-
seven years ago. She has written to me to ask
if I will give her son a welcome to my house; in
fact, Beatrice, my dear, your cousin is coming to-
night, and I feel happier than I have done for
many a long day.”
“She doesn’t give you time, then, papa, to say
whether you’ll give him the ‘welcome’ she asks
for or not. How well she knew you ! Coming
to-night, is he? Good gracious! I wonder what
he's like. Let me look at Aunt Tierney’s letter,
papa.”

So as they sat down to breakfast the father
gave his daughter that letter to peruse which he
had just received from a sister he had parted with
angrily many years before, because she had
sided, with what appeared almost like unsisterly
warmth, with her husband, in a quarrel that had
arisen between the wild, madly-reckless Jack
Tierney and her hot-headed brother. Anger had
long, long since died out; but the breach it made
while it lasted had never been bridged over, and
this was the only communication that had been
attempted since they both were young.
“DEAR MAURICE,” she wrote, “you will not
recognize the hand-writing that has altered from
free, flowing youth to crabbed age since last you
saw it, so at once I will tell you that it is your
sister addressing you once again. Let bygones
be bygones; we were too warm about many
things in the old time, but the warmth never
burned out the love I have always had in my
heart for you. I have with some little difficulty
got your address from the Admiralty, and I write
to tell you now that my boy, Frank, wishes to
make your acquaintance. Being the only child
I have, I hoped, when his poor father died, that
he would have given up the army and come to
reside here, like one of the old stock should, at
Castle Tierney. But he would hear of nothing

of the kind. His regiment has been stationed at
Malta for the last four years, now he is quartered
at Woolwich. Will you give him a welcome?
for a letter I have had from him to-day says he
is going to run down to your address, which I
sent him on Thursday. Let me hear from you
whether you have a wife and family or not, and
what you think of Frank. He came home and
stayed for a week or two, and turned the head
of every girl in the county.
“I shall look anxiously for a letter from you
now that the ice is once broken, and beg to sub-
scribe myself, with all affection,
“Yours, very faithfully,
“MARY THERNEY.
“TIERNEY CASTLE, Tuesday, the 14th.”
Beatrice read the letter through, and then ex-
claimed—“A soldier, evidently, papa; where's
the list? and we'll see what he is. I wonder
if he's a captain. How stupid of Aunt Tierney
not to say what regiment. Oh but there's the
alphabetical list, and I don't suppose there's
another “Frank Tierney’ in the service. What
a pretty name! What was his father like?”
Captain Constable had forgotten; he really
could not say. Then he took up the letter, and
looked with pensive sarcasm at it.
“Mary talks tall about ‘the Castle” still, I

**
find,” he half muttered, “and believes in the
‘old stock” just as she did when Jack was hiding
his head from the bailiffs in one of the castle
cellars. Well, well! we have all our little weak-
nesses.”
“I shall be glad to see Mary's boy,” he said
aloud, “and I should like her to see you.”
“It will all come round, papa, no doubt now.
We shall all be as delightfully friendly as possi-
ble. Here he is; he's a captain in the 41st
Foot—“Francis Ballantyne Tierney.” Which
room shall I have got ready for him? the north
one? No, that's too bleak; he shall have the
south Blue Room. I suppose he will come by
... the eight down-train: who will meet him?”
Now, reader, do not go off into fits of disgust
at the evident excitability Beatrice was display-
ing over the anticipated advent of her cousin.
To understand it perfectly, to sympathize with it
at all, to forgive its want of polished iciness, you
must have experienced some at least of those
sensations which made the little hand tremble,
and the dark cheek glow, and the sweet, ringing
voice falter almost with a new-born happiness;
you must have passed a long period of blessed
calm in the soul-deadening atmosphere of a
secluded country village. If Frank Tierney was
all, or even half of what her imagination pic-
tured him, what importance he would give her

in the rather confined set in which she moved.
Young, a soldier, an Irishman; oh! joy. Bea-
trice drank her tea in scalding gulps, in her haste
to rush off and superintend the ordering of the
room which was to witness the slumbers of this
Inew COusln.
She gave a more graceful bend to the curtains
with her own fair little hands; she talking
“through” her own evolutions—told the house-
maid, with such verbosity, all that was to be
done for the perfect ordering of everything when
he arrived, in order that there might be nothing
out of place to greet the eye of this unknown
guest, and make him doubt the efficiency of her
arrangements, that she cast that domestic adrift
on a wild sea of doubt and confusion—where
she remained during the whole of Captain Tier-
ney’s visit.
And then Beatrice ran down into the garden
and gathered some leaves of trefoil, that she had
never cared much about before ; but he, the
man with the pretty name, was coming now,
and she would like him to see that the emblem
of Ireland, his country, was cherished.
She was wildly impatient for him to come. It
was all so strange to Beatrice, who had never
heard his name before, to hear that Frank Tier-
ney, her cousin, was coming that very night, to
be a guest in her father's house. She kept her

impatience “under” very well, considering all
things; when the room was arranged to her
entire satisfaction, when the shamrock leaves
were placed in a glass on a dressing-table, she
actually sat down to read.
Who has not at some period or other of his or
her career idealized the unknown It is a natu-
ral thing, immediately one hears a name, to
attach a similitude to it. Beatrice Constable read
up “The O’Donaghue,” and fancied her cousin
“would be like Mark perhaps.”
She had waited till after dinner before she went
to impart the news to her particular friends, the
Forests; waited because she had hoped that at
dinner-time her father would settle that question
she had asked him, of “Who was to meet
Frank º’ It was important that she should
know, because if he didn’t think her little pony-
gig would do, she would be obliged to ask for
the loan of Walter Forest's dog-cart and groom.
And Captain Constable had decided that her
little pony-gig would not do, so Beatrice had a
fair and valid excuse for putting on her hat as
soon as the cloth was removed, and rushing over
to the Forests’.
Now it was not only a daily, but indeed an
almost hourly event, this going over to the
Forests'; it only did not occur when the Forests
came over to her. They were very intimate;

they had grown up together—the younger mem-
bers of the family and herself; and being the
only people of the same class in the village, the
result was as might have been expected pre-
cisely.
Mr. Forest, senior, was a gentleman farmer;
but with him my story has so little to do, that
this incidental mention of him is only made in
order that their station may be at once deter-
mined by the reader. Mrs. Forest was an ex-
ceedingly pretty woman, of about forty-nine—
yes, exceedingly pretty, in spite of so many
years having passed over her head; moderately
educated; blessed with that compensating tact
which, if a dairy-woman possesses, she may pass
muster before duchesses; inordinately proud of
her children, a good wife, a careful housekeeper,
an excellent manager, and, withal, a truly kind-
hearted woman.
The eldest daughter, Anna, had lately mar-
ried when my story opens; mention of her,
“together with description,” as they say in
fashion-books, “will be made in another place.”
The second and third daughters, Elinor and
Marian, were remarkable for nothing so much
as for the astonishing belief they each had in
the good looks of the other. They were both
pretty—Elinor in a fair, delicate, refined way,
and Marian in a dark, handsome style; and

they were both “great friends” with Beatrice
Constable.
They had one brother, a man of about eight-
and-twenty, and Walter Forest had the reputa-
tion of being the handsomest man in the county,

- CHAPTER II.
INTRODUCES SOME MORE MEMBERS OF BROOME SOCI-
ETY; AMONGST othERs, HERBERT CHALLONER.
BEATRICE put on her hat and shawl, and
walked out, with a checked impatience, of which
she was not altogether unconscious herself, in
her gait. She went through the garden, and
out into the road, and then she gave a hasty
exclamation of annoyance, for towards her came
one whom she was at all times rather desirous
of avoiding, but never to the degree she was
now. It was Mr. Challoner, the young curate.
He was one of those unfortunate men who go
to college, and study seriously, earnestly, and
well; who attain Hebrew scholarships and a
reputation for theological learning; and who
then come out into the wicked world with their
foreheads unnaturally heightened by severe men-
tal labor, and a total inability to hold their own
in society.
Poor Herbert Challoner had done these things
as completely as any man could; and then he
had put a finishing stroke to his folly by taking
the curacy of Broome, at eighty pounds a-year,
and falling in love with Beatrice Constable.


## p. 20 (#28) ##############################################

20 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
Bis very appearance was against the man in
life. He was tall, with low, long shoulders, and
long arms that he did not know what to do with ;
he never could walk straight if he imagined any
one to be looking at him; and as he was short-
sighted, he was given to taking trees and gate-
posts for people, and so going at them in nervous
curves. He had thin hair of a gingery hue, and a
damp, boiled complexion; and lamentable blue
eyes, with white lashes, that bore an unfortunate
resemblance to a pig's. Altogether, externally,
he was not the man to touch the heart of any
woman, far less of one like Beatrice. For some
months he had looked at her with a liquified love
and miserable mildness in his gaze, that some-
times provoked, and sometimes made her laugh.
Occasionally she snubbed him, when his awk-
ward attentions to her before others made them
laugh at her; but generally her manner towards
him was marked by a sórt of good natured indiffe-
rence, that kept him on hoping that when his
prospects had expanded she would allow him to
lay himself at her feet.
He was the humblest lover a girl could have,
and for that very reason, perhaps, he was about
the most intolerable.
And now, when she was in a hurry to go and
tell the laughing, merry Forests, who could see
this meeting from the bow window where they

usually sat at work—when she was in a hurry to
go and increase her importance pleasantly in
their eyes, by telling them that a cousin—a de-
lightful combination of Irishman, captain, youth,
and good name—of whom she had never before
heard, was coming to night, this wretched curate
came ambling up to her.
“How do you do, Miss Constable?” he began.
That was another thing that made the man a ter
rible trial to so much of the world as had to
shake hands with him. He would address pre-
cisely the proper words of salutation to you, and
then palpably let the ball of conversation drop.
You felt convinced that when you had made your
speech, he would have nothing more to say. So
now, when Beatrice answered rather sharply,
“Quite well, thank you—only in a hurry,” he
passed his umbrella from one Berlin-covered hand
to the other, and smiled feebly.
“A cousin of mine—a nephew of papa's—is
coming to us rather unexpectedly to-night, Mr.
Challoner, so you must excuse my not asking you
in now, for I am going to the Forests to ask if
they will send for him.”
She held out her hand to say good-bye, and
she could not help feeling a little touched by the
profound dejection which overspread his unhap-
pily plain face as she alluded to “a nephew of
papa’s.” -

“Is hea—a young man?”hepresently faltered.
“Yes, quite,” she answered, rather maliciously
—when was a woman not rather pleased than
otherwise to arouse the smothering sensations in
the mind of the mildest of Othellos?—“and he's
a soldier and a wild Irishman into the bargain;
stay—though I can’t ask you in now, Mr. Chal-
loner, perhaps you will come in this evening,
about nine: papa will be glad to see you, and so
shall I.”
She said it with a woman's generous frankness,
when she finds she has a little wounded one
whom she has no desire to wound if he would
not insist upon putting himself in the way of get-
ting cuts. She gave him the invitation to come
and sun himself in her smiles, in her presence,
that evening, because she knew the yellow hue
was overspreading his mind at the picture she
had flashed before his eyes of this cousin. And
he, poor fellow, was weak enough to think she
meant it, as he would have desired her to mean
it, when she said, “and so shall I.”
So he accepted the frankly-given invitation,
with an awkward warmth that showed again
“he was going and making a mistake,” and then
he let her—his star, the brightest gleam that had
ever crossed his path or been dreamt of by him
—go off on her mission.
“Why haven't you been over this morning,

Bee ?” was the question she was saluted with as
she entered the room, where she found, not only
the Misses Forest, but brilliantly-pretty Mrs.
Beresford, the married daughter.
“Why?” she answered, with affected careless-
ness (she was surging with impatience). “Oh,
I don’t know; I’ve been busy; papa wanted
me.”
“What could he want you for? He couldn’t
have wanted you as much as we have. When
Walter came in from the farm, at eleven, he was
quite sulky and unpleasant, and I know it was
because he didn’t find you here.”
Elinor Forest raised her laughing blue eyes to
her friend's face, and found, as she expected, a
blush there, as she spoke of her handsome bro-
ther's chagrin at her absence.
“Where is Walter now * Beatrice asked ; “I
want him so much.”
“That's unfortunate,” said Elinor, “for both
of you. Walter will be very mad when he hears
you have been after him, and found him out;
he's gone over to George Beresford’s to spend
the evening, as Anna came here.”
“Oh! nonsense; I wanted to borrow his
trap.”
“You wanted to borrow his trap !”
“Yes,” replied Beatrice, laughing. “A cousin
has suddenly appeared on the surface of our

family; he's coming to-night, and I wanted
Walter to send to the station to meet him.
Papa won’t let my gig go; he says that the
luggage would scratch it.”
And then, interrupted by many an exclama-
tion and interrogation, Beatrice poured out her
story and anticipations of what he would be
like.
“I am going to have some people on Monday
evening, Beatrice,” said Mrs. Beresford; “mind
you bring him.”
“Yes; don’t be a greedy, and keep him all to
yourself, please,” said Elinor.
“Oh! here's pa; he'll send for him, though
Walter's trap is out,” said Marian.
“My dear, I’ll send you over some cream and
fresh butter. Oh! and I daresay, now, you'd
like a tongue for breakfast,” said Mrs. Forest,
who was, in truth, always sending what she
called “trifles,” over to the young housekeeper.
Beatrice quite glowed; they were all so cor-
dially interested in the expected advent of this
Frank Tierney.
“‘Castle Tierney,’ his mother, my aunt, dates
her letter from. I fancy, from what I’ve heard,
that it's very much like the O’Donaghue's old
castle—grand and ruined, you know.”
Dear little impostor! she had heard nothing
of the kind, but she had employed herself so

assiduously since the receipt of that letter in pe-
rusing Irish light literature, that Castle Tierney
floated almost tangibly before her. -
“Come over to-night,” she continued, after a
little more discursively supposititious conversa-
tion had been indulged in; “come over to-night,
about half-past nine; don't ‘dress;' just drop in,
you know. Anna, can you come Can't you
stay ? I was obliged to ask that stupid Mr. Chal-
loner to call in to-night, in order to get quit of
him when I was coming over here; you must
come to balance him.”
“Can I come in my habit?” asked pretty Mrs.
Beresford; she had ridden over on her mare
“Wenus,” and well she knew, as she affected to
ask the question dubiously, that no other cos-
tume would have set off the exquisite contour of
her perfectly rounded little figure better than the
dark blue cloth, well-fitting habit did.
“Oh, yes; of course, you can. And now” (Bea-
trice was tremendously restless) “I shall go back
and do a little work, for I have been fussing
about the house all the morning, seeing the room
got ready, and all that sort of thing. I have been
making the most perfect housekeeping arrange-
ments, Mrs. Forest; probably it's all anarchy
and confusion at ‘Castle Tierney.' I fancy
there's a sort of rude old royal hospitality prac-
tised there, and I want my cousin to be favorably '

impressed and struck with the vast superiority
of English domesticity.”
Beatrice omitted to mention that she had
been taking Lever as her guide all through
the morning.
“Will he come in a ragged hat, I wonder, and
with his shoes tied together with strings?” Ma-
rian Forest said, inquiringly. Her views of Irish-
men were gathered from a humbler source
(though they were perhaps equally correct) than
Beatrice's; she took the type who came in soiled
shoals to do the harvest for the prospersus Sas-
senach.
No one answered her, for Marian's opinions
were held at their due worth, and consequently
were rarely combated or endorsed by others; it
was “no consequence” what she thought, they
opined, for there's always one fool in a family,
and Marian was allowed by universal consent to
hold that honorable post.
And then Beatrice Constable said “good-bye
for a time” to her friends, and walked away
home, feeling at least two inches taller from
the interest thrown around her by the expected
advent of this (most probably) extremely pictur-
esque cousin.
She went home and searched through every
music-book she possessed, for she had a dim idea
of having some time or other seen some Irish

melodies. At last she found two or three songs.
Amongst others “The Minstrel Boy,” and “The
Harp that once through Tara's Halls,” and these
she practised so vehemently that by tea-time
she almost fancied she had an accent, and that
her having it would only be a natural and pro-
per thing.
How pretty she looked when she took her seat
at the table, and prepared to pour out her father's
bucket-full of tea. The mobile forehead was
fully shown, for the dark wavy chestnut hair
was lifted off it and turned back in a natural
elastic curve. The dark-grey hazel eyes were
brighter than ever with a new excitement, and
they—those lovely long, grey eyes—had marked
with approval that the dress she had selected to
do honor to the occasion suited her rarely. It
was a white clear muslin dress, spotted thickly
with tiny lumps of blue; and it was tied round
the lithest, slenderest waist in the world, with a
rich broad sash of soft Turkish silk—one of the
many things her father had brought her mother
home long ago, in the days of their courtship.
Mrs. Constable had been one of those worthy
women who lay everything away in carefully-
locked drawers. I doubt whether the sash had
ever been out of its folds of silver paper since
the day he gave it to her, and she admired it,
with a judicious reprimand to him for “being

extravagant,” until Beatrice appropriated it for
the setting-off of this blue dress.
Very dainty, and pretty, and elegant she
looked with the soft lace frilling her throat, and
the soft sash floating behind her, as she walked
up and down outside the hall-door with her fa-
ther after tea, with the little hand that was too
small for everyday life reposing on his arm.
Very dainty, and pretty, and elegant ' And
now a gig drove up (Mr. Forest had sent, as his
daughters promised he should), and a man de-
scended from it, thinking her all this. It was
Captain Francis Tierney. -

CHAPTER III.
“You LovE ME, AND I LovE YoU Too, AND-THAT’s
THE REAsoN why.”
THERE is one subject on which the brain of
woman—be she old or young—is ever active; if
she is not employed in schemes for herself, she is
for her friend; and that subject is matrimony.
Now, Beatrice Constable for the last few
months had fallen into the fatal mistake pro-
pinquity is so apt to engender, of fancying herself
in love with the only man with whom she was
much thrown in contact. Gradually—she could
hardly tell how—but gradually the old brotherly
and sisterly relations between Walter Forest and
herself had died out, and it seemed to the eyes
of all beholders as if other and more endearing
ones were going to take their place.
She had always liked Walter, from the time
he had teased her into captiousness and kissed
her into good humor again, when she was a little
child. She had liked him partly because he was
very handsome, partly because she saw him

constantly, and partly because he made it flatter-
ingly evident that he liked her.
This last, if a man be neither of the genus
bore, fool, or prig, is the thing that acts most on
the heart of a very young girl who has no coun-
, ter influence at work. Consequently, for the last
few months, Beatrice had deemed that it behooved
her to blush a little when they half-laughed at
her about Walter; to tyrannize over him with
that wealth of ingenuity a woman knows so well
how to employ in the cause when she sees the
man rather approves of his golden chains than
otherwise; and to feel a tender interest in his
sister Elinor's future.
From the moment that letter from Frank
Tierney's mother had been received, Beatrice had
resolved that, if her cousin were nice enough, he
should in due course of time be honored with
the hand of her particular friend.
This had been one of her principal causes of
anxiety for his arrival. She wished him to like
her of course, but she put her own attractions out
of court as far as regarded anything beyond
mere liking; and now he was come.
The gig drew up; her father, went forward
with the quick gesture of salute that comes with
such a gallant grace from a sailor and a gentle-
man—went forward with a frank, cordial greet-
ing for his sister's son.


## p. 31 (#41) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 31
A man descended slowly from the gig (where
was the Irish warmth, where the Irish impetu-
osity Lever had been teaching her to believe in
—she felt disappointed), and after returning her
father's salute, and shaking hands with him, and
replying, in full, rich, deep tones, that had not
the least taste of “the accent” about them, he
turned to her, and instead of giving her the em-
brace she had more than half expected, said, in
a leisurely voice, “One of your daughters, I pre-
sume,” and doffed his hat, with a low sweep that
was polite and polished—nothing more.
“My only daughter, and my only child,” Cap-
tain Constable replied. “Beatrice, come and
give your hand to your cousin. I can’t have
my daughter and my sister's son bowing to each
other only when they meet, though it is for the
first time.”
Captain Tierney laughed, and advanced to
Beatrice to do as her father bid him; and stood
revealed before her, under the bright summer
evening sky, the handsomest man she had ever
seen in her life.
He was widely, widely different from the dash-
ing, half-wild Irishman she had pictured to her-
self; and though her heart was disappointed at
the difference, her taste was gratified.
He was not very tall—scarcely above the mid-
dle height; rather slight—not with the slightness

that betokens weakness—fine-drawn, not thin.
There was an indescribably refined air pervad-
ing every movement, that would in another man
have been common-place—a refinement that had
no effeminate pettiness about it, that threw a
new atmosphere around her in the first moment
of his addressing her, that gave her a glimpse of
a world she had not hitherto dreamt of His
face was rather small and pale; and the pointed,
small auburn beard and carefully-trimmed droop-
ing moustache concealed the lower part of it en-
tirely. But the shape of the oval cheek was
perfect; and the form of the white brow carried
out the idea of that symmetry she felt must be
there, though the beard and moustache hid it.
But, above all else, superior in charm to every
other feature of a face that she already deemed
matchless, were, his eyes; of that deep, steady
blue that combines so dangerously the power
and pathos of every other hue. They were deep
set, but not sunken; so that the lids came down
from the brow with that line which is sure to
accompany so purely Grecian (without being
feebly straight with his forehead) a nose as had
. Frank Tierney.
He stood so quietly, drawing off the well-fit-
ting, unsullied, pale-lavender kids from his re-
markably small hands, talking to her father
about his mother and Malta, and the “strange

appearance a ‘gig' had in these days when a
fellow never saw such a thing,” that Beatrice
began to dissolve her views respecting a matri-
monial alliance between him and her friend, and
to regret rather that she had given the whole
village that cordial invitation to come and see
him. Captain Tierney did not look as if he
would stand being made a sight of
Presently, after they had sat down to the sup-
per Beatrice had hoped so he would enjoy, and at
which he did little she observed, save look at her
with the cool quiet gaze of a connoisseur in such
things—with a gaze that was not impertinent, or
indifferent, or earnest, or admiring, but simply
such a gaze as a man who desires to make him-
self master of the subject bestows upon an object
—presently, then, after this state of things had
endured for a little time, the Forests and Mr.
Challoner “dropped in,” as requested by Bea-
trice.
The ladies could do it very well. Lovely Mrs.
Beresford—the prettiest little brunette in the
world—was far too much of the sunny order of
womankind for a shadow of any kind, far less of
constraint, to abide in her presence. She “had
come,” she said, “to win a promise her friend
Beatrice had not liked to give, namely, that Cap-
tain Tierney would accompany his cousin to her
house on Monday evening.” And Captain Tier-

ney, transferring the connoisseur-like glance
from his consin to the black hat and feather,
and sweet face and well-habited form of the
lady, bowed his acceptance at once, with no
feigned graciousness.
But Herbert Challoner was not the man to do
anything in an incidental manner; he came in,
poor fellow ! in a pale damp heat of agitation, of
a mixed nature. He fell over Beatrice's Skye
terrier, Muff, the moment he entered; and Muff
increased the embarrassment his sorrow for the
mishap caused him to feel, by viciously snapping
at and worrying the tops of his boots till she
tore his stockings, which she then caught be-
tween her teeth, and unravelled all over the
room, in a burst of terrier glee that was refresh-
ing to witness.
And all this he had to endure under the gaze
of those quiet eyes, that turned and rested upon
him—he felt it—with the same profound, calm
indifference they did upon the dog at his heels.
And then, as he—that man—that grave gentle-
manly, soldier-cousin of hers—leant his arms on
the table and ignored him, the richly-gifted scho-
lar, but ignorant man of the world—as Captain
Tierney did this, Mr. Challoner saw the eyes
that he would have given his life to win a
smile of love from-he saw them turn from him
with a look of mortified loathing, and tremble

with the tremble the water gives when the
breeze touches it first, as they rested on and met
those of her cousin.
“I expect Walter will come in presently,
Beatrice,” Elinor Forest said, when there was a
slight pause, with a sort of laughing significance
that made Beatrice's blood tingle with annoy-
ance ; she accounted for it to herself imme-
diately, by thinking that it was so unpleasant
to have such an allusion made before a stranger.
“Will he?” she replied, carelessly.
“Yes, if he comes home in time.”
Beatrice felt that a look had come into her
cousin's eyes at last, that he probably would not
have bestowed upon a mere inanimate object—a
look of inquiry. Directly she saw it; she felt
more annoyed than she had previously done with
her friend Elinor.
Muff and Mr. Challoner had disentangled
themselves from each other now, but not till
poor Muff's fore-paws had been stepped upon,
and she reduced to a state of that whining an-
guish which demands so imperatively sympathy
and redress from the fair mistresses of these ter-
rible dogs.
“Oh, Mr. Challoner, what have you done?”
Beatrice said, almost pettishly. “You’ve crushed
her dear little paws. My darling!”
The last epithet was not bestowed upon Mr.


## p. 36 (#46) ##############################################

36 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
Challoner at all: it was given to Muff, tenderly,
as Beatrice picked up that sufferer, and retreated
from the table to the sofa with her, for the bet-
ter examination of her mangled toes.
Mr. Challoner was about to meander across to
her, with heart-felt apologies and silent expres-
sions of sorrow, for that he should have been
driven by her dog into hurting it. But before
he could “assemble his limbs"—as a fertile-in-
phraseology Frenchman termed it—for the pur-
pose, Captain Tierney had quietly seated him-
self between his cousin and Mrs. Beresford, had
removed Muff from his mistress's lap, and with
his slender white fingers was engaged in dividing
the long fawn-colored hair on Muff's feet, in
order, as he said, “to discover whether they were
there still, or whether they had been pulverized.”
Mr. Challoner felt that it was an unkind thing
on the part of this graceful-actioned, perfect-
mannered man, to throw that additional tinge
of ridicule over his unhappy awkwardness.
The evening went smoothly enough now, for
a time, for those with whom we have most to do.
Now he was sitting by her, talking to her, and
to her dog, and to her friend Mrs. Beresford, all
of disappointment that she had been inclined to
feel when she found he was not the Irishman of
literature, faded away, or rather became absorbed
in one great feeling of intense satisfaction that

he was what he was. She found a happy tre-
mor, an ecstatic excitement overspreading her
mind, under the influence of which she grew
(she felt) more pleasing, more charming every
moment. Mr. Challoner, being completely
thrown out of the conversation, had nothing to
do but watch these pleasing signs: and the damp
coldness of agitation turned, as he sat there, to
the damper coldness of despair; for “he will
study his own happiness more than hers,” he
thought, as the fathomless blue eyes were bent
ever and anon with a deeper, more intense gaze
on the face that had been the sun of Herbert
Challoner's life.
“Won't you give us a little music, Beatrice?”
her father said, after a time. Captain Constable
was very fond himself of the dashing nautical
melodies of Dibdin, rung out in the pure fresh
young voice of his daughter. Strange as it ap-
pears, he liked to listen to the contrast between
the almost rough coarseness of some of the sailor-
bard's songs and the innate refinements of Bea-
trice's lightest tones. But Beatrice felt that
Dibdin would not do now ; so she turned over
the old favorites and took another in her hand,
and then stood looking through her eyelashes at
her cousin, who had followed her to the piano.
“What is it?” he asked, taking it from her—
“‘The Minstrel Boy!"—what is it?”

Downfall of everything ! Here she had been
“getting up’ a song that she had anticipated
would stir his Irish heart, at least, with pleasure,
and he could look at it serenely and ask her
what it was.
For answer, she told him “one of Moore's,”
and then sat down and sang it.
“The fewer recruits of that sort that they had
in those wars the better, I fancy,” he said, when
Beatrice had shot her last notes at him with an
energy, and banged her chords with a fire that
was a last attempt to arouse something like sym-
pathetic nationality between them ; and then he
could say—
“The fewer recruits of that sort that they had
in those wars, the better, I fancy. His harp
must have been very much in the way of the
man who stood behind him, and must have pre-
vented his using his father's sword with anything
like efficiency.”
Beatrice chafed for a minute or two; then she
looked up, and—forgave him. At any rate, she
felt, if her out-Heroding Herod as far as getting
up enthusiasm about Ireland would not bring
them to a cordial sympathy, that they would
have for the future the even better ground of a
thorough understanding. Frank Tierney looked
in her eyes till she laughed, and then he said—
“Forgive me for not responding better to your

kind desire of giving me pleasure in the only
way you could suppose my father's son could
receive it. Captain Constable, my uncle, proba-
bly has told you of my father's foibles.”
She shook her head.
“No 1 Well, then, I will. My father took
such an intense, and to me altogether incompre-
hensible pleasure in being called ‘Wild Jack
Tierney’ and ‘Fire-eating Jack Tierney,' and in
being flattered by a lot of the wretched, dirty,
benighted pig and potato-loving, priest-ridden
peasantry around him, that he wasted his time
and talents, and what money he had, in keeping
up the character they gave him. I got an over-
dose of Ireland and everything connected with it
when I was young, Miss Constable; and the
consequence is, I am a continual disappointment
to my mother for not carrying on what she is
pleased to call the ‘traditions of the old stock;’
though what those ‘traditions’ are, beyond
drinking a great deal of punch at unholy hours,
I cannot get her to explain. Now I have said
this, you will not withdraw the friendship you
were prepared to give the wild, gay Irishman
you had imagined a Tierney must be ſ”
No; unquestionably, decidedly, Beatrice was
not at all inclined to withdraw anything. She
did not sing any more, but she turned round and
leaned on the back of a chair that stood near the

music-stool, and Captain Tierney sat on a low
chair by the end of the piano, in an attitude that
brought his magnificently handsome face, and
matchlessly easy grace of form and manner, well
under Beatrice's observation. He was some-
thing different, truly, to poor Mr. Challoner, who
was sitting like a nervous crab upon his chair, in
a position that could have brought rest to not
one single limb. He was something different,
truly, to Walter Forest, who entered at this mo-
ment, and whose tall, dark, manly beauty was
of no secondary type; but the merely handsome
man, taller though he was, superbly handsome
as he was, faded into mere nothingness before
the polished, refined young soldier with the clas-
sical face and easy, gravely graceful bearing.
“Who's that man, Beatrice?” Walter Forest
asked, rather gloomily, when at last he managed
to get a quiet speech of the girl with whom, at
once, he could see this stranger would have the
power to “cut him out.”
“My cousin Frank; Captain Tierney. I can't
tell you more now—he's looking,” she answered,
proudly. -
“Who was that remarkably fine specimen of
the yeomanry of this county, did you say?”
Captain Tierney asked, when the guests at last
departed. And Beatrice Constable answered,
that he “was only Walter Forest.”

CHAPTER IV.
WHAT THEY ALL THOUGHT OF EACH OTHER WHEN THE
EVENING WAS OVER.
HERBERT CHALLONER went home—to the only
home he had in that place, at least—to the little
stuffy, low-roofed room that looked out on the
bleakest part of Broome, and a duck-pond.
He lodged in the house of a small farmer, who
worked his own land, and whose wife was glad
to eke out their scanty subsistence by “doing for
the curate.” Never a curate surely was done for
with such ease as Herbert Challoner. He even
gave satisfaction to that proverbially hard-to-
please class, landladies; his present one declared
him to be a lamb—which, though perhaps not
the precise epithet all men would desire to obtain,
meant great praise when applied by Mrs. Butler
to young curates.
He went home to his little room, after that
pleasant evening at Captain Constable's, and
lighted his lamp, and sat down, paper before him,
and pen in hand, to write his sermon.
For though he tumbled over dogs, and was

awkward and uncertain in his gait, and horribly
nervous—and was doubly these latter things be-
fore Beatrice Constable—he did write sermons,
such as, if he had had any name to start with,
would have made that name sound. But the
poor, gentle fellow was not one to push himself
forward in any way; he droned out rich pieces of
composition Sunday after Sunday to his Broome
flock, and though he felt sorry that they so palp-
ably didn't understand him, it never occurred to
him that it would be wise to seek a more appre-
ciative audience. He was too honest and con-
scientious to crib—to buy a strong skeleton, and
deck it with weak, new wordy flesh—as too
many men, who are capable of better things,
condescend to do. The sermon that would be
listened to by the Miss Forests, Miss Constable,
five ploughmen, and the Sunday-school children,
was composed by him, invariably, with as much
elaborate care as if all the Oxford Dons were to
hear it.
But this night he could not write, though
paper unsullied, and pen new, tempted him to
do so. And here I must remark upon the extra-
ordinary temptations clean paper and new pens
offer to those whose business in life it is to soil
the one and spoil the other. The sight of them
appeals to the heart as surely as does the note of
war to the charger—or the suspicions of there

being something wrong about somebody to the
matured maiden inhabitants of a watering-place
in the dull season. How could he write words
of piety and wisdom, with the memory of the
look that had come—he could not blind himself
any more—into the eyes he loved so well, when
they turned and looked at him before he had ex-
tricated himself from the confusion in which her
little dog had involved him *
And worse than this, for this only was a fore-
shadowing of future sorrow to himself, harder to
bear for the generous-hearted man was the me-
mory of the glance he had seen tremble as it
gleamed through the long lashes, and met the
cold, deep eyes of the stranger. He felt so mourn-
fully his hopeless inability to save her from any
possible pang; he acknowledged his lack of right
to give her a word of warning or advice respect-
ing this dangerous cousin who had flashed upon
her life with such a fascinating suddenness and
brightness. And then, feeling more strongly
than ever that there were other and better things
in life than his philosophy had ever dreamt of
before he came to Broome, he constrained him-
self once more to take the path of duty by writ-
ing his sermon for the following Sunday.
His was surely an unhappy life, and most un-
deservedly so; virtue, in his case, rewarded itself
most meagrely. He was the eldest son of a poor,

hard-working, broken-spirited rector, who had
scuffled through thirty unsatisfactory years in
the Church—years which had brought him noth-
ing beyond ever-increasing chagrin, and shabbi-
ness of coats and manner, and a family of twelve
children, who insisted, every one of them, upon
growing up hardy.
Herbert had gone to College, and worked, as
I stated before, till he won a Hebrew scholarship,
and elevated his forehead to heights which were
hideous, under the pleasing and pious belief that
he should then, with its proceeds and a curacy,
be enabled to maintain himself and his eldest
sister Emily, in humble, harmless respectability.
But on testing his resources in the inexpensive
atmosphere of Broome even, they failed him so
far as his fraternal intentions were concerned,
and with pain and grief he had to give an un-
willing consent to his sister going out as an edu-
cational slave.
And yet, with the vision of the domestic mi-
series of his father's house fresh in his mind still,
with the memories of the thousand ills, mortifi-
cations, and inconveniences poverty had brought
to him in its train, for all these things—dead in
the teeth of prudence—he had dreamt of a time
when a wife might be his. And this evening his
dream had received a shock, such a one as even
Herbert Challoner found it hard to bear.


## p. 45 (#55) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 45
Beatrice Constable had seen Mr. Challoner's
love for her this evening with more impatient
disgust, and disgusted impatience, than she had
ever previously experienced. No matter how
'good, estimable, educated, attached to her, a
man may be, let a woman once feel that he is
ridiculous, and a tide of loathing will set in which
he can never breast. He had seemed so to her
often before, but never to the terrible extent he
did now, when she compared—no not that—but
glanced from him to Frank Tierney. Her face
burnt with crimson flushes when she stood before
the glass that night—burnt till she shrouded it
in her hands and shuddered with a cordial de-
testation as she thought, “What will he think of
me if that man lets him see that he has liked
me?” She would have liked to have been able
to assure herself at that moment that Walter
Forest's regard had been all along of the purely
fraternal character she now wished to imagine it.
She could not feel anything like anger or con-
tempt for Walter; she could only wish that he
was not quite so rough, not quite so abrupt, not
quite so provincial, and not quite so fond of her.
And then she went to bed, and after hoping ex-
citedly for a long time that Captain Tierney
would not find life at Broome too terribly dull
for him to remain the time he had himself ap-
pointed (a week), or ever come there again, she

went to sleep, and was crushed in her dreams
beneath the ruins of Tierney Castle and a sack
of potatoes.
The Misses Forest came out into the yard to
see their sister start on her homeward ride.
When her brother had mounted her, he left her
side for a minute, to speak to her groom.
“I think,” she said, leaning down to pat her
mare's neck, and speaking half laughingly and
half earnestly, “that Walter had better take care
if he wants Beatrice Constable; that is a danger-
ous cousin.”
“I don’t see it at all,” said Elinor, rather
sharply. Elinor was very fond of Beatrice, but
she did not like her attractions being taken for
granted in this manner. Another reason for the
sharp retort might be found in a natural sisterly
dislike to a brother being thrown over, and an-
other in a natural womanly desire to appropriate
the unexceptionable stranger to herself.
“I don’t see much in him,” said Marian.
Marian loved, and was beloved by a youthful,
rising agricultural colossus of the neighborhood,
therefore she could not be expected to see much
in a man who was both slight and short. “I
don’t see much in him; he is a poor thing to have
made such a fuss about. But that is just like
Beatrice, to talk large and be rather stuck-up.”
Now, it was most unlike Beatrice to be either

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 47
of these things, and in reality the Forests were
very fond of her; but the remark was not at all
unnatural under the circumstances. The young
ladies speaking, and the young lady spoken
about were alike on promotion; therefore it was
to be expected that the one who seemed most
popular for the first vacancy, should, in a con-
versation held on the subject in her absence, go
to the wall.
“Well, good night,” said Mrs. Beresford; “all
I say is, Elinor, don’t you and Beatrice get fight-
ing about him. I don't fancy Captain Tierney
would approve of arms being taken up on his
account, and as I want him to come to my house
on Monday, I should not like you to drive him
off before. Good-bye, Walter; mind you come
on Monday. What's the matter with you?”
Walter was shaking his sister's hand, and half
muttering a negative—
“Nothing; why?”
“Oh I didn't know ; you seemed grumpy, I
thought. Good night, girls; take my advice
about Captain Tierney,” she continued, as she
rode out of the yard.
“What about Captain Tierney?” Walter asked.
“Nothing, nothing,” said Elinor, who had not
exactly approved of her sister's hint; “only that
we are to be sure to take him over on Monday
evening to her house.”


## p. 48 (#58) ##############################################

48 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
“I fancy Miss Constable will save you all trou-
ble on that score,” said Walter, with a sort of
savage carcasm that proved the same lively fiend
was gnawing at his heart as was preventing the
proper development of Herbert Challoner's theo-
logical views.
“Why, yes, I suppose she will drive him in
her pony-gig,” said Elinor, who did not seem to
see why Captain Tierney should be so immedi-
ately, in the eyes of all, appropriated to the sole
and whole use of Beatrice; “unless she would
rather go with us, and then you could drive him,
couldn't you, Walter? and that would save trou-
ble in George's stable, you know, because there
will be such a lot of horses to look after.”
“One more or less don't make much differ-
ence,” said Walter, as they reëntered the house.
“I think you had better let Miss Constable drive
her cousin; she won’t thank you for interfering.”
And how about the cause of all this rancor
and jealousy % Captain Tierney had taken his
candle, and said good night, and lounged up to
his room with a carelessness of manner, look, and
gait that might have assuaged an Othello. He
had come down to resume relations with his
mother's brother, simply because he disliked the
idea of keeping up what wasn't a feud in reality,
but what might look like one, in support of ultra-
Irish sentiments. This had been his sole and

whole motive in coming to Broome. He had
half anticipated finding his uncle rough, hearty,
coarse, and uninteresting; he had thought there
would be an aunt, elderly, fat, and common-
place, and a heap of children of all ages and
sexes, who would butter his coat and call him
cousin. Therefore, though he said nothing, be
had been rather more than gratified to find that
the possibly coarse uncle did not exist, but that
in his place lived a frank, lofty-looking gentle-
man, who could offend no canon of taste; that
the aunt was not in any guise, and that the
small children were merged in the person of as
beautiful, attractive, and well-bred a girl as he
had ever met with, in his by no means limited
experience.
That she, Beatrice, was not one of the many he
had dreaded, or anticipated—was the only thing
that interested him in her as yet. He had not
done what the two men who loved her feared he
had; neither his heart nor his head wandered
about her. That she was what she was, well, for
she was his cousin. There was nothing about
either father or daughter to quash his friendly
sentiments, and send him home in disgusted

making himself happy, at home, and agreeable—
aye, even to those rather second-rate people whom
Beatrice had introduced to him as her particular

friends. All this he thought as he stood brush-
ing out the short-cropped auburn curls; but long
before the light was put out in the visitors' room
of Captain Constable's house, his thoughts had
travelled far away into another world, and Bea-
trice Constable was forgotten.
Memory went back to a time long ago, when
he had first begun to feel a boy's admiration for
a woman who had nursed it into love. Went
back to the time when he had believed in the
good that is in all men, to the degree of ignoring
the outward interestedness of a man, and faith-
lessness (towards others) of a woman, under the
mistaken impression that a something better lived
beneath the conventional surface. Went back
to the time when he had awoke and acknow-
ledged his mistake, when the man had played
him foul, and the woman meanly false. Went
back to the first outburst of sorrow and disap-
pointment, which had passed over, leaving him
unaffected seemingly; to the time when the torch
of passion went out, leaving him, not unhappy,
not misanthropic, but a “dreadfully unimpas-
sioned, collected man,” said women, and the
“coolest hand in the corps,” said men.
Then, when he had thought over that phase of
his life, memory made a retrogade movement of
great suddenness and length, and carried him
back to the days of his childhood, when he had

stood with a child's proud, pure flush of shame
for others on his brow, and been a constraine
witness of those revels in his father's house
which, composed as they were of rioting and
whisky-toddy, had made the words “hospitality”
and “conviviality” odious in his ears.
He thought of the coarse, rash extravagance
which had been the order of the day at Castle
Tierney during his father's lifetime. He thought
of the gradual lighthearted disregard of all that
his innate refinement taught him to consider the
decencies of life, that had marked the household
arrangements in the home of his boyhood. He
thought of his mother; of her efforts, noble, wo-
manly, and futile, to conceal from him, her only
son, the gradual but sure ebbing away of her
respect from her careless, uproarious, stimulant-
seeking husband. He -thought of the ostenta-
tious expenditure, and cruel internal grinding
and discomfort, which told even to his childish
heart a tale of rents applied before they were
due ; of the sham protection awarded to the few
mean wretches who traded on his father's weak-
nesses, and whom, consequently, that father chose
to take as representations of the large-hearted
peasantry of Ireland. He thought of the sham
castle, and the sham enthusiasm and nationality.
And as he thought of all these things, his mind
came round again to that from which it had

a started, and he thanked God that from the breast
of one—and that one the fairest and the best—
of his family, he had been able to eradicate at
once and for ever, he trusted, those mock senti-
ments which, developed, had always moved his
SCOrn.
“Beatrice is a sensible, charming girl,” he
murmured; “I don't fancy she will like me the
less because I told her that I suffered from an
over-dose of Ireland in my boyhoºd.” And so,
somehow or other, after the long journey they
had taken, Captain Tierney’s last thoughts were
of his cousin, after all.

CHAPTER W.
CAPTAIN TIERNEY MAKES AN OFFER TO MISS CON-
STABLE-OF His ADVICE
THE morning may be a fresh, pure, favorable to
the development of qualities of amiability and
innocence time, but it is a terribly disillusionizing
one, nevertheless. If one goes to bed remarkably
happy and satisfied with oneself and one's pros-
pects in general, one is sure to wake up, in the
grey dawn, with the certain conviction that both
are alike shady and futile.
If this is the case with all people, more or
less, especially is it so with the impressionable
and impulsive ones of the world. They in-
variably see everything of a roseate hue, by
artificial light.
Beatrice Constable woke up the morning after
her cousin's arrival with a delightful conscious-
ness that Frank (she called him “Frank” to her-
self already) was in the house, but with a morbid
one, that took all the edge off “delight,” that he
would find it dull.
She felt suddenly, somehow or other, that the

54 THE CROSS OF HONOR,
house, the place, the people, would all be proven
too small for him. There darted upon her a mad-
dening sense of her own insufficiency to occupy
the time and attention—from dwelling too much
upon the mediocrity of all their surroundings—
of such a cool, critical, polished gentleman as
this cousin of hers turned out to be. Frank was
in the house, true enough ; but in the morning-
light Frank loomed too large for the house alto-
gether.
However, ruminating about it would do no
good; indeed, the longer she lay there, the more
colossal grew the dimensions of that question of
“What shall I do with him " So she got up,
and (sensible girl!) took the first steps towards
alleviating that difficulty by dressing herself
prettily.
She understood, in all its bearings, how to
achieve a carefully-careless toilette. Nothing on
Beatrice had the appearance of being the result
of study, though everything harmonized with
everything else. The cotton dress, the simple
violet and white striped print, that she put on
this morning, on any other woman would have
been a loose, rather untidy bag. But on Bea-
trice the voluminous folds, well starched though
they were, of the bodice, moulded themselves
into her waist with a compact neatness that was
not precision, but that still did not mar its slen-

der, graceful outline by an additional hair's-
breadth. Perhaps her strength in the matter of
dress lay in her thorough appreciation of the im-
portance of accessories. She knew full well that
the robe itself may be perfection, and yet, for all
its perfection, a huge failure, if the collar and
cuffs, the belt and the hair, do not “go well”
with it. She knew this, and always acted upon
it, but never with more complete success than
this morning.
As her father thought, when, with a speed
that would have been destruction to a less se-
curely organized head of hair, she dashed through
the hall to give him her morning greeting, as he
stood smoking on the doorstep.
“Papa,” she began, rather wistfully, looking
up into his face with the proud fondness of a
daughter for a father whom she feels to be rather
more distinguished-looking than the generality
of mankind, and rather superior in all essentials
to the world at large; “Papa, dear, what shall
we do with him?”
“With whom, Bee?”
“With—Captain Tierney.”
She had paused in uncertainty with herself as
to what she should call him.
“Do with him? Give him some breakfast
when he comes down, and after that let him
alone. You don’t think he is one at all likely to

desire a small dinner-party got up in his honor,
do you? Depend upon it, he's not the fellow,
when he does pay a visit to an old man, to want
anything done with him. Let him alone, Bee,
and take my word for it that he'll shake down in
an hour or two as if he had been in the ship for
a year.”
“Oh! but, papa, that's nonsense. You may
be right about the dinner-party. I don’t see
whom we could ask, in fact, that would not bore
him to death nearly. But still, sauntering about
the garden, and smoking with you won’t be
enough for him. He will like to see a little of
the county; he ought to see the Brag Priory
ruins, for instance.”
“Well, “Robin Hood’ has all his shoes on, for
a wonder, so you can drive him over to Brag, if
he feels inclined to go and swelter in search of
broken walls, when he could sit at home comfort-
ably out of the sun; you can drive him, can’t
you?”
Beatrice could hardly tell why, but she felt
imperatively led on to say, “No, she couldn't
alone; it would be dull; she would ask the
Forests to go too.”
“Or I daresay Walter Forest would lend him
a horse, and then he would be off your hands,
Bee.”
To this proposal Bee gave a decided and per-

emptory negative. “It wouldn’t do at all,” she
said, “for them to pass Captain Tierney off en-
tirely upon their friends; she would manage
some way so that the Forests should be included
in the arrangements for the day, but she must
take her share of entertaining him—it was her
duty to do it, as he was papa's guest.”
Captain Constable and his daughter sauntered
the length of the garden, and then paused by the
gate; and as they rested their arms upon the top,
to take their outlook on passing mankind with
greater convenience, Beatrice broke the silence
again by saying, “What do you think of him,
papa, upon the whole *
“I have only thought of him in part yet, Bee.
I like him as an acquaintance; I think he's a
good specimen of a soldier, polished without be-
ing a puppy; he's the most agreeable young
man I ever met with. But how I shall like him
as a nephew remains to be proved by the future.
What do you think of him 7”
“I –oh! I can hardly tell: at first starting I
was disappointed; but I got over that.”
“Oh! you got over that, did you?” said her
father, gazing down at the chestnut head that
kept itself steadily bent to the ground by his
side; “well, that is right; for as a cousin is—or
should be—regarded as a brother, especially by
a girl who does not possess a genuine one, I

58 THE CROSS OF HONOR,
should be sorry to see any other than fraternal
relations existing between you.” -
“Certainly, papa; of course you would,” Bea-
trice replied, promptly; but her heart fell even
while she spoke, and it was a pale face that set
towards the house immediately afterwards, as *
they turned to walk back to breakfast.
She could not—or at least she did not care—to
analyze her sensations when her father said those
words, “I should be sorry to see other than fra-
ternal relations existing between you.” He sim-
ply meant, of course, that he should be sorry to
see unfriendly ones arise. That was the only
meaning his words could have, yet they per-
formed that curious mental operation on Bea-
trice commonly know as “taking one down a
peg or two.”
So damped out was she by the refreshing, deli-
cious, pure country air—or something—that she
bestowed a silent blessing on the budget of let-
ters and papers which came in simultaneously
with Captain Tierney. She was capable this
morning of pouring out the tea gracefully; of
offering him viands in silvery tones; of doing
the honors, in fact, of her father's house as be-
came her father's daughter; but not of sustain-
ing a brilliant flow of conversation with the
handsome stranger with whom her father desired
her to institute fraternal relations. Therefore,

Beatrice Constable was glad that Frank Tierney
had letters, the perusal of which appeared to
render him oblivious of her presence until the
meal was nearly over, when her father stirred
him into consciousness by saying—
“There's nothing in the paper this morning,
Frank—nothing whatever—but there it is, if you
would like to look at it. What are you going to
do with yourself to-day?”
This is one of those imbecile questions that
hospitable and otherwise intelligent people will
persist in asking when they have caught a guest
who knows nothing whatever of the habits and
customs of either themselves or their vicinity. It
is by no means an easy question to answer. Most
people get out of the little difficulty by smiling
feebly, and asserting that they are at the service
of their friends. Captain Tierney said—
“Nothing.”
“There, I told you so, Bee,” said her father,
laughing; “this girl wanted to drag you about
ruin-hunting in the heat.”
“Certainly not, unless he wishes to go, papa,”
said Beatrice, rather angrily; “I said,” she con-
tinued, turning to Captain Tierney, “that if you
liked, and if the Forests liked, we would drive
or ride over to Brag, because every one who
comes into the neighborhood ought to see the
Priory; but if you would rather stay at home, I

am sure papa will be delighted to have your
company.”
“Have the Forests anything to do with me—
or you—that you include them in the day’s pro-
gramme?” he asked.
She gave her head an impatient toss, and the
color rolled over her face like a wave as she
answered—
“To do with us? What a question 1 Can't you
understand that it's a very natural thing, that as
we are the only people in the place, we should
be very intimate, and always do the same things,
and be a great deal together?”
“Yes,” he replied, gently, “I can understand
that your being so is a very natural and a very
much to be regretted thing.”
“Captain Tierney f”
Beatrice was not used to the mildest of censure
being bestowed upon her, and now this man,
who had not condescended to betray the slight-
est degree of flattering interest in her, was quietly
blaming the intimacy and friendship which sub-
sisted between the Forests and herself. She was
very angry, and her brow showed it, and her
eyes, and her voice. There was a wealth of in-
dignant interrogation in that “Captain Tierney?”
that quite gave him new sensations respecting
her. His eyes flashed sympathetically; he liked
to see blood tell when the spur was applied ever

so lightly. If she had simpered when he cen-
sured, and smiled awkwardly, or said “Oh, why!”
he would have taken very little further interest,
I fear, in the continuation of his—and discon-
tinuation of the Forests’—intercourse with her.
But he subdued all other manifestation of sym-
pathy or admiration as he quietly answered her—
“Yes, I assure you I think that it is a to be
regretted “acquaintance, no, intimacy, yes. The
fact is,” he continued, “relationship must be my
excuse for trenching on delicate ground. For-
give me when I say that your residence here, and
consequent friendliness with these people, has
caused the brother to presume on appearances,
and your total inability to imagine such an im- .
pertinence”
“As what?” she asked, but the blushes that
lived in her face were angry ones no longer.
“As falling in love with you,” he answered.
“You of course could not guard against a thing
that you could never suppose a clown like that
would venture to be guilty of; but I, being a
stranger, fathomed it at once.”
“How you speak!” she said, impetuously;
“how you despise my friends' brother!—not that
he ever could be anything more than that—but
there would be no impertinence or presumption,
or anything of the kind, if he did; but he does
not. I wonder, if you scorn them all so, that

you promised to go to their sister's on Monday.
Do you look down on everybody who is not in
the army, may I ask?”
(“Don’t get savage, Bee,” remonstrated her
father.)
“Heaven forbid!” he replied, laughing; “and
as to my “scorning’ and “ looking down' on peo-
ple, these are things that I never did in my life,
I assure you. My views—such as they are—are
not very singular, I imagine; a man in my eyes
must be one of two things, he is either a gentle-
man or he is not a gentleman. I have not the
slightest objection to meeting young Mr. Forest,
or feeding with him (I'd take a chop with a
crossing-sweeper any day if he were clean), or
conversing with him if he can converse, which
latter thing I take leave to doubt. But at the
same time I cannot consider that his entertaining
hopes of an alliance with it redounds to the
credit of my family. Now I have offended you,
Miss Constable, and I am ready to ask a thou-
sand pardons, and to do any amount of penance
in order to wipe away that offence. I really
thought that you would notice it no more than
if I had suggested you should send a dog home
who was pertinaciously following you without
your having observed it. I forgot at the moment
how well you knew him—how slightly me; how
strong his claim on you—how more than weak

mine. I spoke out of the sincerest mixture of
interest, folly, and stupidity that it can ever have
been your misfortune to have suffered from.
Imagine what I feel at having done an awkward
thing to you, and forgive the manner for the
motive.”
“I suppose I must,” she said, (it was no diffi-
cult matter, Beatrice,) “ or papa will be angry.
Papa, it's a shame of you to have sat quiet and
let me fight it out, when he was so “dreadfully
superior' about my friends. Why didn't you
help me?”
“I wanted to see whether you were to be
trusted in action alone, and I must say, Beatrice,
I thought you would have stood to your guns
better in defence of an ally than you have done.
Frank's attack was fierce, partly through igno-
rance of the real long-tried friendship which has
been the growth of years. Your defence was
apologetic, and that does a cause more harm than
anything. Now I’ll have another cup of tea,
Beatrice, unless it's cold; and after that I shall
take Frank out to have a talk about his mother;
and then you have your pony put in, and take
him for a drive to Brag, if he will go.”
“Undoubtedly he will do that latter thing,”
said Frank, rising; then, as he held the door
open for his cousin to pass through, he said, in a
low tone, “There or anywhere else with you,

Beatrice, if you will only take me.” And Bea-
trice went out of the room with her heart flutter-
ing happily.
Beatrice took her hat off the hall table, and
stood hesitating with it in her hand for a minute
or two. “Shall I go over, or shall I not?” she
thought; “if I do, they will talk him over so
frightfully, and pronounce—Marian will—some
of her stupid decided opinions about him, and
speak of him like they do of other common-place
people, and I couldn't stand that. And if I don't
go, they will talk me over till my ears tingle, I
know they will; and Mrs. Forest will make all
sorts of stupid surmises, and say that I'm keeping
away from them now I have somebody else. I
think I’ll go.” So Beatrice did the thing that
was right, though to do so was a hard struggle.
Yes! for the first time she found it rather a hard
matter to go over to the Forests’.
“I hear your cousin doesn’t trouble to make
himself very agreeable, my dear,” Mrs. Forest
said, when Beatrice went in and found them all
sitting in the bow window, working. “Just as
if Frank hadn't been in the place at all,” she
thought, with almost a gasp of anger at their in-
difference; though sooth to say, had they shown
too great an interest about him she would have
gasped from other causes.
“No, we didn't say that, mamma,” Elinor

said, half apologetically; “we only said he did
not seem to care much what anybody thought
about him. Didn't you think now yourself, Bea-
trice, that he was rather cool?”
“Perhaps,” said Beatrice, oracularly
“Walter thinks nothing of him,” said Marian.
“Walter thinks” began Beatrice, impetu-
ously.
“Well, I suppose he's not too good for Walter
to think anything he pleases about him, is he?”
said Marian, rather crossly. “I never saw any
one like you for strange faces, Beatrice. He did
put on airs last night—he did, Elinor. I don’t
care what you say; he put on airs, and looked
down on us; and if you call that good manners,
I don’t, and I will say it. He doesn’t think we
are as good as he is, because we don't happen to
have relations in the army, and because we don’t
come from London. And I don't think anything
of him.”
With this totally irrelevant rider, Marian con-
cluded her essay on airs, which not a little of.
fended and shocked Beatrice; she had not quite
realized before how very narrow-minded her
friend was, or how very limited her range of
thought.
“What utter nonsense you talk, Marian l’” she
said, angrily; “you seem to forget that he, my
cousin, is not an ignorant fool. I think you

might find some different fault with him, even if
you don’t like him, than that which the washer-
woman would. “Because we haven’t lived in
London,’ indeed! as if he was a mere country
bumpkin, to be dazzled by a short sojourn in
London.”
“Don’t call Walter names, even if you are
going to throw him over for this wonderful Cap-
tain Tierney.”
“I am not calling Walter names.”
“You are; you meant him when you said
“country bumpkin.” Here is Walter;” and as
she spoke, Walter stalked into the room with a
darker brow than Beatrice had ever seen him
wear in her presence before. “How horribly
exacting and unjust they all are ſ” she thought.

CHAPTER WI.
BEATRICE PLACEs. HERSELF IN A POSITION OF PERIL.
“Oh, good morning,” said Beatrice, in rather
an agitated voice, rising up hastily, and giving
her hand to Walter Forest with considerably less
self-possession than she usually exhibited.
“Good morning; I didn’t expect to find you
here.” He tried to say it in a lightly satirical
tone, but light satire not being one of the ele-
ments of heavy minds generally, he failed, and
said it savagely instead.
“Why not?” retorted Beatrice; “why should
you not have expected to find me here this morn-
ing as well as any other morning I generally
come over to see Elinor and Marian about eleven
o'clock, and I have come a little earlier to-day,
to my misfortune, for I find you have none of
you got up your amiability yet.”
“I am amiable enough,” replied Walter, stroll-
ing to the window, and pulling a bit of his sis-
ter's embroidery to pieces; “only I thought that
you would be too much taken up with that grand

cousin of yours, Cap'en Tierney—don't you call
him?—to come over to see us.”
“‘Taken up !’ what an expression 1 Walter,
you really should leave the farm behind you when
you come in, and not talk like your laborers
would about things. And don't call him “Cap'en'
Tierney; you let your words drop out of your
mouth so carelessly, it is really quite painful to
hear you.”
Beatrice said it in a merry, good-tempered tone,
—with a tone and manner, in fact, of serio-comic
correction that she had frequently used to Wal-
ter with impunity, but to-day he did not like it
evidently.
“Come, don’t be cross any more, any of you,
please,” said Beatrice, presently, in her half-plead-
ing, half-coquettish way; “I want you to go to
Brag this afternoon with us; how shall we
arrange about locomotion?”
“I suppose you will drive Captain Tierney
yourself, Beatrice,” said Elinor; “will you not?
and if you do, you won’t want us.”
“Won’t want you,” replied Beatrice, pettishly;
“you really seem disposed to make much ado
about nothing. It would be a small compliment
if I only asked you to go because I couldn’t get
there without you. No, I don’t care about driv-
ing Frank, if you will both come with me instead,
and Walter will give him a mount and join us. I

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 69
think that would be by far the bestway; then they
could ride by us and talk, and we should not be
half so divided as if we go in separate phaetons.”
“I have been to Brag often enough,” said
Walter. “I don't care to go again—there is
nothing fresh to see; but I will send a horse over
for your cousin, if you like, Beatrice.”
Beatrice saw in a moment, with a woman's
clearness of vision on such occasions, that Walter
wished to go with them, and was only waiting
for her to press and persuade and plead for that
for which she really did not care very much—his
company. However, he was such an old friend,
that he must be humored in his absurdities a lit-
tle; time enough to give him pain when it could
no longer be avoided. So she said—
“Now, do not be grumpy any longer, Walter,
but say you will come to oblige me.”
So Walter said he would come, and agreed to
the ruin-hunting plan, with this amendment: that
they should take sherry and fruit with them, and
as this would necessitate a hamper, that Elinor
should drive their large phaeton, instead of Bea-
trice her small one. And when matters were
thus affably settled, Beatrice went home to im-
part the plans she had been forming for his hap-
piness to her cousin Frank.
She found him sitting in a little rustic arbor,
made of uncomfortable boughs of wood, with a

small table before him, smoking a cigar, and
writing letters.
“Ah, Miss Constable,” he said, as Beatrice
paused, with a half-apology for interrupting him,
at the entrance, “I lost you and took to writing
under the earwigs in despair. Where have you
been º’”
“Over at the Forests,” she replied, laughing
at the recollection of the remarks he had made
about them. “Now don’t say anything, for you
will have to endure me and my friends while you
are here. They are going to Brag with us this
afternoon, and Walter Forest will lend you a
horse if you like to ride, and I am going in their
phaeton instead of behind Robin Hood; and we
are to partake of refreshments of a light nature,
on the long, damp grass that grows amongst the
Brag ruins. And now you have heard the ar-
rangements, what do you think of them?”
“They are perfect as far as they go,” he re-
plied, gravely. “I am in your hands, Miss Con-
stable—or Beatrice rather, your father says I am
to call you. May I make a suggestion now *
“Certainly you may.”
“It is that Mr. Challoner be asked to join us,
and that you lend him Robin Hood.”
“Oh, what for I don’t think I can.”
“Why not? does not Robin Hood carry
well?”


## p. 71 (#81) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 71
“Y-es; but a-well—if you like I will send
down to him.”
“Do,” said Captain Tierney, who did not ex-
actly care to be entirely thrown upon Walter's
companionship during a long ride, and who
sagely thought more amusement might be ex-
tracted from the combination of the mild curate
and the rustic Apollo.
“I suppose I had better write him a note,
hadn't I?” asked Beatrice.
“If you do, intelligent domestics will have no
chance of making any mistakes.”
So Beatrice penned a polite note to Mr. Chal-
loner, which, small and polite as it was, had the
effect of making that misguided young man for-
get his agonies and resolutions of the previous
night, and indulge once more in visions of the
impossible. -
How tenderly he handled the little sheet of
paper on which Beatrice had scrawled rapidly—
“DEAR Mr. CHALLONER,-Give us the pleasure
of your company this afternoon; we are going to
Brag, to look at the ruins and eat fruit.
“Yours truly, BEATRICE.
“Be here at two.”
She had penned the words so idly under the
subtle influence of a pair of eyes that made her

regardless of what she was doing. His “truly,
Beatrice!” and he, poor fellow, pondered and
went into depths of still deeper love over them,
and thought that, even yet, “it might be so,” for
was she not asking him to go with them to
lovely, romantic Brag?
Therefore it came to pass that the sermon, be-
gan in rather a despondent strain, finished with
the most cheeringly hopeful of views as to things
in general, and the subject of the text in parti-
cular. -
And even while he was assiduously cultivating
these symptoms that betokened a relapse—and a
relapse is well known to be invariably much
worse than the original disease—Beatrice sat un-
der the green trees, and watched the broken rays
of light falling through the leaves upon the bright
chestnut hair, and tawny moustache, and hand-
some bent face of her cousin.
He had given her polite and gentlemanly at-
tention when she joined him first; he had laid
down his pen, and listened to her plans, and ac-
quiesced in them, and even offered a suggestion
respecting them. . But having done that, he had
gone back to his writing, with an apologetic
allusion to the importance of his letters. A feel-
ing came over Beatrice that Captain Tierney,
though he liked her presence, deemed it neces-
sary to have something like a safeguard against

it, in the shape of occupation. “Why is it, I
wonder?” she thought; “is he afraid I shall
touch on that topic of the feud that existed be-
tween my father and his; silly fellow ! he need
not be.” -
“If that girl knew what was good for her, she
wouldn't sit here and look pretty, and—interested
in me,” thought Captain Tierney, as, after rather
a lengthened pause, he looked up and found
Beatrice's eyelashes levelled at him with an ear-
nestness that, when detected, caused floods of
emotion to surge over her face.
“Dinner is on the table,” said a voice at the
entrance, suddenly; and, looking up, they saw
Jane, the housemaid, and both blessed her for
that interruption. -
They rose; and he, gathering up his letters
hastily, said, “I have been writing to my mother,
to urge afresh what I have often urged upon her
before, that she should come to London to live
for a time. If she does, Beatrice, you must go
and stay with her.” Beatrice flushed, bright-
ened, smiled a quick, happy smile.
“Would you live at home * she asked.
“Decidedly not,” he answered, coolly; “but
though I should not live at home, I am likely to
be quartered near town for some time, and I could
keep a fraternally-sharp look out on you, Miss
Beatrice. We are speaking about what I men-

tioned to you just now,” he continued, as they
entered the dining-room, and found Captain
Constable gazing at the cooling viands. “I am
telling Beatrice that I should keep a sharp look-
out on her, and not allow her to throw herself
away, if she came up to stay with my mother.”
“You are very kind, really,” said Beatrice,
stiffly. “Not so much meat, papa, thank you;
I am not hungry. But I should not have imagined
you set up for a match-maker; and if you only
desire to get me as your mother's guest in order
that you may procure a husband for me, I can’t
feel it enough of a compliment to accept the in-
vitation.”
“Ah! you’re a little tired now,” said Captain
Tierney, good-temperedly; “the heat of that ar-
bor was too much for you; be practical, Beatrice
—eat a good dinner, like I am going to, and
don’t get angry when I sketch out plans for your
good.”
“I shall come out and see you start, Bee,” said
her father, when she rejoined them after dinner,
dressed for her drive; “I wouldn’t miss the sight
of poor Challoner on the outside of Robin Hood
for a trifle; does he know how he's going?”
“No, papa; I thought his miseries would com-
mence soon enough, so I only asked him to “go
with us; I didn't say how. Here are the Forests
—and there's your horse—see, Frank.”


## p. 75 (#85) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 75
“Is Captain Constable going with us?” said
Elinor Forest, laughing, and pointing to Robin
Hood, a short-necked pony, with vicious eyes,
and no shoulders worth mentioning, who stood
ready-saddled, tied to an apple-tree, and eating
grass.
“No, Mr. Challoner rides him, and here he
comes,” explained Miss Constable, as Mr. Chal-
loner, all unconscious of his fate, came in, smil-
ing seraphically on everybody, Captain Tierney
included.
Now, for the sake of being near Beatrice, Mr.
Challoner would have ridden a rocking-horse, or
a buffalo; he would have trembled at doing it,
but he would have made the attempt. This be-
ing the case, he never thought of objecting or
refusing to mount Robin Hood (her pony), but
his heart went low, and his cheek went pale, as
that sturdy little steed was led up to him.
“Hadn't you better take the reins up before
you get on ?” suggested Walter Forest, who, as
he sat with the perfect ease of a thorough horse-
man on his magnificent hunter, forgot his hatred
of one rival in his amiable delight at the compli-
cations that were about to encompass the other.
“Miss Constable's pony is apt to be skittish,
like his mistress, if you give him his head too
much.”
Captain Tierney raised his eyeglass and looked

fixedly at Walter Forest, till he had made the
latter feel that his mentioning Miss Constable in
that way was a reprehensible thing. Then he
dropped it, and looked round at the reverend
equestrian. “Are you quite ready now?” he
asked, gently.
“Quite,” said Mr. Challoner, with a smile of
resignation that was piteously touching.
The Brag ruins were ten miles from Broome,
but the road certainly did not seem “long to-day,”
the three girls agreed. However, when they
arrived there, Mr. Challoner was discovered to
be in a state of such extreme exhaustion, through
a certain flightiness which had marked the bear-
ing of Robin Hood, that it was deemed advisable
to test the reviving powers of the contents of the
hamper.
“We brought some champagne as well as
sherry, Captain Tierney,” said Elinor. “Mam-
ma thought of it for you.”
“Really I must call on Mrs. Forest this
evening, and thank her, first, for thinking of me
at all, and then for sending me champagne.”
“I don’t think I can go home on that pony,”
said Mr. Challoner, sorrowfully; “he has jolted
me so, that I have palpitation of the heart.”
“Well, what is to be done with you?” asked
Elinor; “you can’t walk home, Mr. Challoner,
that's clear; and I don't see how we can take

you in the phaeton. Besides, what is to become
of Beatrice's pony ? The little wretch won't be
led after a vehicle.”
Mr. Challoner was very sorry, but he could
not help it. He would be willing to walk home
and lead the pony; ride home he could not.
“Well, we will see what can be done when it's
time to start,” said Beatrice: “now let us go
round the priory.” -
Brag Priory, like many another old ruin, has
still its spiral, narrow staircase, leading to no-
where, standing; and its underground communi-
cation with some far-distant abbey, and its well-
preserved arch, and its almost-demolished ban-
queting-hall, and its niches, where, in the be-
moaned past, power walled up passion. And it
had its specially-dangerous jutting wall, where,
out on the extreme of the crumbling edge, the
“best view’’ in the connty was to be got.
“If you will come up here, Beatrice,” said
Walter Forest, “I will show you where we
“killed ' that famous day last winter, when you
rode with us.”
“Don’t get up,” said Captain Tierney; but
Beatrice disregarded him, and determined on
doing as Walter, “poor Walter!” asked her.
Along the wall she balanced herself cleverly
enough; but when she came to the edge she
grew giddy—partly from the height and partly

from vexation at finding herself alone with Wal-
ter, and tacitly giving him encouragement to
hope again.
“Can't I get down this way?” she said; “I
dare not go back along the wall. Oh, Walter'
why did you get me up here? I’m frightened.”
“I’ll go round and down,” said Walter, “and
help you down this way. Don't be frightened.
Or shall I take you back with me?”
“No,” she shuddered, “don't.”
“Well, stand quite still then,” he said, “and
don’t look down. You are not usually nervous.”
Not usually nervous ! No, truly it could not
be said of Beatrice that “usually” she gave way
to aught approaching to young ladyism. But
now—on this occasion—when she found her
cousin Frank by her side, with his arm round
her waist, with his hand warmly clasping her
own, she gave what sounded uncommonly like a
gulp of hysterical satisfaction.
“I feel safe now, Frank,” she said; “I could
walk back over anything with you.”
And he forgot prudence, as the most prudent
men will do at times, and said, as he clasped her
still closer to his side—
“Beatrice, my darling! you ought to feel safe
with me, indeed, for I love you /*
Memory, prudence, self-reproach, all came to
him before the last tones of the words that had

caused that lovely flush to rise on her cheek had
died away. She, gazing at him as he now, with
only chivalrous politeness, guided her steps along
to safety, saw him turn pale; and her own heart
failed her, in quick response to that gathering
gloom on his brow.
“Frank,” she said, softly, when the exclama-
tions of joy at her safe return, and surprise that
she could have been foolish enough to get alarmed
at all, had subsided—“Frank, I have to thank
you for bringing me well through my difficulty;
no one else’’—
“Would have made such a fool of himself as
I did at the moment, thanks to Mrs. Forest's
champagne, Beatrice. Come, prove to me that
you forgive me, by forgetting those idle words;
will you?”
Captain Tierney was himself again, with a
vengeance, as he said those words. And Beatrice
emulated his composure, as she answered, “For-
gotten and forgiven, Frank, as entirely as even
gyou can desire.”

CHAPTER VII.
MR. CHALLONER's CHATEAU D'Espagne Is DE-
MOLISHED.
BEATRICE was in wild spirits the rest of that
day. Her voice was the clearest and merriest,
her laugh the loudest and blithest. Never does
the father of deceit rule so entirely in the female
mind and soul as when a heart-wound has been
given, and the world must have dust thrown in
its eyes as to the amount of injury received.
With her cheeks flushed, and her eyes flash-
ing; with her beautiful lips wreathed into a smile
that would have been lovely had it been a trifle
less set and determined; with her whole person
and bearing fraught with a strong, unfaltering
desire to be charming and brilliant, Beatrice
Constable was these latter things to a degree
that startled her cousin, and utterly overwhelmed
with surprise those old friends who had known
her well and long.
“He has made her an offer, and she is happy,”
thought Walter Forest, as he sprang into his
saddle and dashed his iron heels into the sides of

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 81
his horse, with what that animal justly con-
sidered to be most reprehensible violence.
“He has shown himself to her already in one
of his selfish phases, and she is miserable,”
thought poor Herbert Challoner, slowly adjust-
ing the reins over his arms, as he set off with the
keenly vicious little Robin Hood, now in a per-
fectly self-satisfied frame of mind, through hav-
ing to carry nothing on his homeward journey.
“She has made up her mind to catch him this
afternoon,” thought Elinor Forest; “poor Bea-
trice! he is too quiet and well bred for your flash
to tell on him though, I fear.”
And Elinor Forest, as she feared this, looked
up into the face of one of their cavaliers—and
that “one” not her brother—with a glance that
was softer and more tender, gentle, subdued, and
feminine than those invariably kind blue eyes
had ever bestowed on mortal man before.
They were all wrong—which is frequently the
case when people grow sententious over the
heart-affairs of their neighbors. He had not
made her an offer, nor was she striving to win
him; but, unquestionably, she had failed to re-
cognize anything “selfish” in his policy as yet.
The cause of that extra flash and glitter of hers
was to be found, poor girl! in the gradual deve-
lopment upon her of a great truth, to which both
Frank as well as herself would be victims.

She was worn out with her false mirth, and
quiet enough, as they drove up the little village
street on their return. The reaction was setting
in now, and poor Beatrice, for the first time in
her life, dreaded an evening at home; and as she
thought of this, pain gnawed again at her heart
dully, and she throbbed wildly to the conviction
that it would not be this evening alone that she
would have to endure this nameless something,
this saddening weight; but that it would be to-
morrow, and the day after, and, in fact, through
all the dismal years that stretched away in inter-
minable vista before her.
“You must come—will you, too, Captain
Tierney —and drink tea with us this evening,
Beatrice,” said Elinor, as they got out of the
phaeton in the Forests’ yard. “You have to
thank mamma for the champagne, you know,”
she continued, addressing Captain Tierney; “and
as we should be sure to amalgamate directly
after tea, you may as well submit to your fate
and come in at once.”
“I must go and tell papa, then,” said Beatrice,
“or he will wait for us. I will be back soon.”
“We can send over to Captain Constable,
Beatrice; you needn't go.”
“Yes, I must, thank you,” said Beatrice, im-
petuously. She was glad of this break in her
thoughts that spending the evening with the

Forests would afford, but she wanted a few mi-
nutes to herself.
“We will put a small boy to intercept Mr.
Challoner and Robin Hood as they pass the
gate,” said Elinor, as they watched Beatrice out
of the yard; “he will want some tea, I should
think, poor fellow; and nothing will refresh him
like a cup in the presence of Beatrice.” -
“I cannot congratulate my cousin on her con-
quest,” said Captain Tierney, bending the whip
he held nearly double.
“Oh! of course not; it would be a dreadful
pity, indeed, if Beatrice threw herself away on
him.”
“She won't be thrown away, as you term it,
down here at all much longer, I think,” said Cap-
tain Tierney, politely holding open the door for
Miss Forest to enter.
“Indeed!” she replied quickly, flashing her
eyes at him interrogatively; “you are more
candid than Beatrice; she has not told us that
you are”
“Going to induce my mother to establish her-
self in London for a time, with my cousin for a
visitor. My plans for Beatrice end there, I as-
sure you, Miss Forest.”
And then Elinor, considerably comforted by
this assurance, introduced him to her mamma.
“But where's Beatrice?” asked Mrs. Forest,

84 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
when she had called their attention to the tea-
table, already spread with loaves and fishes (the
former home-made, the latter of the shell denom-
ination) for their refreshment after their drive.
“But where's Beatrice?—gone home tired, I ex-
pect. I always do say that girl does too much,
and don't take proper care of herself; but girls
are so giddy now-a-days, Captain Tierney, that
you may depend it’s quite a trial to have any-
thing to do with them.”
“Well, mamma, Beatrice won't be any trial
now, for she's only just run home to tell her
father that we are all safe and back, and to
change her dress.”
“What did she want to do that for ? She
might have come in as she was,” said Mrs. Forest,
who no more would neglect an opportunity for
casting mild censure on Beatrice than on one of
her own daughters. -
“Not exactly,” exclaimed Elinor; “she got
up on a wall with Walter, and down with Cap-
tain Tierney; and in doing one or the other she
tore her dress.”
“You may depend it was that pretty blue one
she had on, too,” said Mrs. Forest, thoughtfully;
she took a tenderly fervent interest in Beatrice's
wardrobe; “she should not have gone and put
that on for Brag.”
“The fault lies in another quarter, my dear


## p. 85 (#95) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 85
madam,” said Captain Tierney; “the champagne
you sent me, and the sun we had arranged with
to shine brightly the whole time, dazzled me to
the degree of my not guiding my cousin clear of
a broken part of the wall.”
“She shouldn’t have— Here she is. Bea-
trice, you shouldn’t have got up on that wall, it's
dangerous. Not one of you should have gone, if
I had thought you would have gone climbing
and romping about.”
“Walter deluded me into the scrape,” said
Beatrice, who was delighted at all times to have
light skirmishes with her old friend; “you must
scold him, Mrs. Forest—not me. Walter asked
me to go up, and I couldn’t refuse him.”
She said it lightly and brightly, as women will
say things when they are savagely bitter; and as
she said it, she took her seat at the table, next to
Walter, and glanced at her cousin with a small,
defiant gleam in her eye. He was looking at
her with the same look that had aggravated her
the night before, when he came first—with the
same absence of anything save critical observa-
tion in his eyes. “I’ll make him feel—the stone,”
thought the girl, hotly.
“Walter,” she exclaimed, suddenly, “here's a
refractory button for you to try your well-known
skill in such matters upon; I can’t get it to
meet; do it for me.”


## p. 86 (#96) ##############################################

86 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
And as she laid her little white hand on
Walter's massive paw, and he essayed to drag
the muslin round her wrist and button it, she
followed her shot, and saw that Frank Tierney
had been awkward and spilt his tea.
“That will do,” said Beatrice, pettishly snatch-
ing her hand away as Walter took toll of his
labors by administering a palpable grip to it;
“you're so rough.”
“Don’t be cross; I didn't hurt you,” said
Walter, who deserved considerable credit, under
the circumstance of the re-setting in of the tide
towards himself, for having refrained from kiss-
ing the hand which had been so confidingly
placed upon his own. To be sure, kissing a
woman's hand is a thing, though, that only oc-
curs to a gentleman or a man who is quite on the
lower round of the social ladder; they divide the
chivalry of the age—the half-and-half, semi-gen-
teel classes have it not. So Beatrice, instead of
having her hand kissed—the naughty coquette!—
as she deserved, had it pulverized instead, before
the eyes of her fastidious relation.
“They’re always quarrelling—we may know
what it will come to,” whispered Mrs. Forest,
confidentially, to Captain Tierney, when the
meeting was adjourned, and the young people
rose to go out in the garden.
“Indeed What?” asked Captain Tierney


## p. 87 (#97) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 87
aloud, which had the effect of throwing Mrs.
Forest off her mental balance for the rest of the
evening.
Walter was in affably high spirits. “Have a
weed, Tierney?” he asked, as they stood in the
hall, while the girls were cloaking themselves
with affected carelessness, and a keen regard to
the grace of the garments, or rather to the way
they were put on. Tierney never called men by
name himself, so now he just touched his eye-
glass lightly, in indication of the fact that he
would presently survey through it that audaci-
ously ignorant fellow-creature who had pre-
sumed to try it on with him, and answered,
“Thank you! no, Mr. Forest.”
Walter felt taken down; and we know how
kindly a man feels to the one who takes him
down in the presence of the woman he loves.
But Beatrice had tact, so she affected to be
oblivious of this passage of arms; and as they
sauntered out into the garden, Captain Tierney
went to her side and said, “You’ve remarkably
good taste in dress, as well as everything else,
Beatrice—that is a pretty barège, or what do you
call it—take my arm.”
Though he said this, and though Beatrice
blushed at his noticing that she had put on a
dress of the pale violet hue he had that morning
told her was his favorite color, still she was mis-

tress of the situation and herself, and replied, with
the frankest, sweetest calmness,
“No, thank you, Frank; Walter’s always my
escort in these evening walks; and, besides, it
wouldn't do to break up into family parties, in
the way you propose.”
“As you like,” replied Captain Tierney, qui-
etly, almost with unconcern; “my motive was a
remarkably pure and exalted one, allow me to
observe. I don’t want to see you take a country
heart and break it ere you go to town, that's all.”
“Have you done such a deed yourself, Frank,
ehl and do you want to save me from the pangs
of a like reproach 7 Don’t be afraid,” she con-
tinued, with the clear little laugh a woman can
give when she means to be spiteful to the man
she loves—“Don’t be afraid, Frank; if I take it,
I won't break it, I promise; will that satisfy
you?”
“Here comes Mr. Challoner; late for tea after
all, poor fellow, after that dreadful walk; who'll
go in and make him some fresh—will you, Ma-
rian f"
And on Marian's replying somewhat brusquely,
after her usual manner, that she wouldn't, Beatrice
nobly threw herself into the gulf that yawned
between Mr. Challoner and tea, by saying, “she
would take the responsibility of giving it to him
upon herself.”


## p. 89 (#99) ##############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 89
“You inveterate little flirt!” her cousin whis-
pered, as she passed him in advance of exhausted
Mr. Challoner; and Beatrice detected a shade
of annoyance in the tone.
Mrs. Forest had gone out into the village to
see some ailing child; so Beatrice and Challoner
had the room to themselves; which fact was a
matter of joy to one person concerned, and a
matter of indifference to the other; and when
this is the case, the one to whom it’s a joy is safe
to go to the wall.
“Miss Constable,” said Challoner, sipping his
tea, and scalding himself, “I took the greatest
care of your pony; Robin Hood would tell you,
if he could speak, that I treated him as tenderly
as you yourself could have done.”
“It doesn’t answer to be tender with Robin
Hood,” said Beatrice, whose normal state it was
to be practical; “he’s a pony on whom sentiment
is lost; if you had given him a good whipping,
now, when he first began to skew about the road
and go awkwardly, he would have cantered
smoothly enough. But I saw you letting him
keep on with his wrong leg forward, and I thought
how it would be directly. You should have hit
him, and made him feel the curb.”
“Hit your pony, Miss Constable? No! not if
he had killed me. Do let me”
Beatrice saw what was coming.

“Do let me,” she interrupted, “give you an-
other cup, with lots of sugar—no! won’t you,
really? Well, then, let us go out to the others.”
She rose to go, but for once he was too quick
for her.
“Miss Constable, I must speak.”
“For goodness sake, do then,” said Beatrice,
tears of excited impatience coming into her eyes;
“but, Mr. Challoner, if you were kind you would
not.” - -
But he could not be kind, I suppose; at any
rate, when he went home—which he soon did, for
he was tired he said—he knelt and thanked God
for that henceforth love of a mortal would never
interfere with the work of that Church to which
he had devoted himself. The earthly dream was
over for ever for poor Herbert Challoner, the
gentlest, humblest, most unselfish Christian that
ever lived.

CHAPTER VIII.
MASTER ALICK's views of PARADISE.
“WHERE have you been. all the morning,
Frank?” Beatrice asked of her cousin, the next
day, when about one o'clock he came into the
garden, where she was trying to be busy, and
not think about him and that invisible chain
which held him back from her.
“Down sitting in Challoner's room.”
“Oh!” said Beatrice, the color rising freely.
“What induced you to go there?”
“I can't tell myself” he replied, meditatively;
“if any man had told me that I was going down
to Challoner's room, to give a confidence to, and
gain one from a young curate, I should have
called that man a fool; and yet that is exactly
what I have done.”
“Given and gained a confidence, did you say!”
“Yes, Beatrice; he told me about you. Don't
blush, it's better over; and I told him something
that I am not going to repeat to you, but that I
fancy has made him think better of no, not that
—but like me better than he did before.”


## p. 92 (#102) #############################################

92 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
“And do you mean to say, Frank, that you
care anything about the opinion of such a man as
Mr. Challoner? He's a very good man, I know;
but he's not one I should have thought you
would make a friend of.” -
“Would you not have thought it? Neither
should I, a few hours ago. But I’ll tell you what,
Beatrice, though I should have been awfully dis-
gusted if you had accepted him, you refused one
of the noblest hearts that ever beat, and one of
the best men that ever lived, when you refused
single-hearted, simple-minded Herbert Challo-
ner.”
“Why would you have been “disgusted,’ then,
if I had accepted him?” said Beatrice. *
“Why? For several reasons. One is, that
between you, you would not have been able to
get bread and butter—which, though far from a
succulent diet, is yet essential. Another is, that
you are too good to be thrown away on any one
in a subordinate position. Another is, that he is
a great deal too good for you—or any other wo-
man. These angelic men invariably fall in love
with quite the reverse. Have I given you rea-
sons enough, or do you want more ?”
“Quite enough, quite enough, Frank; you
persuade me, into taking your view of the case
exactly. I only hope you have been equally suc-
cessful with Mr. Challoner. I feel, since you say

it, that I am too good for him, and he for me;
and that we are both well out of what would
have been a bad bargain. Muff's just behind
you ; don't step on his paws.”
“Where did you get Muff?” asked.' Frank,
bending down to pat the Skye, who immediately
went over on his back after the manner of Skyes,
and offered his four feet to the world.
“Walter Forest gave him to me.”
“He’s a bad bred one,” said Frank; “get rid
of him, and I'll send you down either a blue
Skye or a white Cuban when I go back. I hate
the idea of a lady petting a mongrel.”
“Poor old Muff,” Beatrice said, when she was
alone; “would he have me part with you, as well
as all my other old friends, for the sake of the
little he'll ever give me. Poor old Muff!”
“Go out on the lawn, and tell your uncle that
your aunts and Captain Tierney are come.”
The speaker was Mrs. Beresford; the time,
Monday afternoon, five o'clock; the place, the
open window of Mrs. Beresford's drawing-room.
The words were addressed to her husband's
nephew, Alick Floyd, who was on a visit to
them.
“Yes, I'll go. Who's that man with a mous-
tache 7”
“You mustn't call him a man, Alick—that's
Captain Tierney; now go.”

“Well; but isn’t he a man?” -
“Now go, as I tell you; and if you’ll be a
good boy, when we're playing Aunt Sally you
shall pick up the sticks.” With which brilliant
prospect Master Alick was compelled to start on
his mission.
There were a great many guests assembled;
but, after a comprehensive glance round, Cap-
tain Tierney decided that, after his own cousin,
there was no one so well worth talking to as his
pretty hostess. Without any marked specialty,
she was what a very strikingly pretty woman
finds it easy to be—charming; and nowhere was
she more charming than in her own house.
“Yes, he might hold her tea-cup; and, yes, it
was a pretty place; the view from that bow win-
dow she admired immensely herself, and so, of
course, you know (with a tinkling laugh) she was
delighted to find some one with good taste ad-
miring it too. That rug where the dog was lying

tain Tierney like sitting so low. Yes, that was
her own pet dog, Belle; such a sensible dog—
she never let anybody her mistress didn't like,
touch her; the sympathy between them was
quite magnetic,” she said.
And Captain Tierney, as he replied, “Ah,
was it, indeed?” patted and smoothed the dog
whose seat on the rug he had elected to share,

and Belle wagged her fringed tail, and put her
great paw up in his hand, and slobbered, and
showed pleasure in various ways. e
“Will you stay with us long, Captain Tier-
ney : Do you like us well enough to prolong
your visit? How do they treat you at Broome
—I mean my people; for I know that Captain
Constable is an old darling, and Beatrice is
lovely and agreeable enough to make any one
like any house. But what do my people do for
you!”
He told her of the visit to Brag, and enlarged
on the kindness and attention he was receiving
from all the lady members of the Forest family.
“How do you get on with Walter?
“Admirably.”
“That is, I suppose,” she said, laughing, “you
say good morning when you meet, and good
evening when you part; isn’t that about the ex-
tent of the conversational intercourse between
you? Now I must set people going; we are go-
ing to play croquet and Aunt Sally out on the
lawn; do you like them *
“They are far too scientific for me; added to
which, I object to picking up my own sticks.”
“Alick will do that for you; won’t you, Alick?”
“No,” said Alick, stoutly; “not unless he'll
run me a race; then I will.”
“We'll see about the race, my little man,”

said Captain Tierney, drawing the boy towards
him. “What is your name?”
“Alick Floyd is my name, England is -my
nation, this is my dwelling-place, and”
“You’re a naughty boy, Alick,” interrupted
his aunt; “you mustn't say that.”
“Oh, I may, though; it was all—who was his
salvation and all—in Tom's book, and Tom got
it from the Sunday school, so I may say it. What's
your name?”
“Frank Tierney.”
“What's that thing for?”
“To look through; I'm short-sighted.”
“You should wear spectacles, like grandpa's,
then ; because this makes you crinkle your nose
up, all funny—it does, aunt—I saw it just now,
when you put it up. I say, if you won’t run a
race with me, will you play a game?”
“What game?”
“Oh any you know—any game is good, I
think. I tell you what's capital—Tom and I
play it; tie up one of your legs and hop on the
other, and I'll tie up one of mine and hop on the
other, you know, and then we'll see who goes
furthest and fastest. I wonder if Bee Constable
would play it?”
The vision of Beatrice and himself hopping
along was too much for Frank's gravity. His
burst of laughter knocked down the Chateau

d'Espagne Alick had just erected; but, with the
elasticity of extreme youth, Alick was ready to
lay the foundation of another. -
“I’ll go and make Bee Constable tell me a
story. She never laughs like that,” he said, as
he departed for the quarters Beatrice had taken
up. But Beatrice failed him in his need, for
they were all going out to play croquet now, and
poor Alick, completely adrift, was reduced to
picking up the sticks that they shied at Aunt
Sally, after all. Aunt Sally is a delightful game,
but one that after a time is apt to pall upon .
people. There is something monotonous in the
pleasure of bruising a face with a thing like a
rolling-pin, particularly if one makes the mistake
of offering to be prompt and picking up one's
own sticks in the first instance. The golden rule
of never doing yourself what you can get some
one else to do for you, specially applies to this
game, and Beatrice did not observe it. She
picked up her sticks, and shortly grew tired.
Young married women—especially those who,
in addition to being young and married, are
pretty and charming—are sometimes given to
putting the delicate finger which, immediately it
becomes encircled with the hallowed ring, is
supposed to be possessed of extraordinary and
intelligent clear-sightedness—they are very much
given, I say, to putting this delicate finger, with

the best intentions, into other people's affairs.
They are, as it were, made free of topics which a
short time before it would have been bad policy
to touch upon ; and they like to show the extra
knowledge they have now gained from their
husbands of men's minds, by airing these topics
for the benefit, usually, of some fair, unmarried
friend. They know well how good the effect of
a word in the right place may be, and they are
courageously willing and ready to risk the other
side of the question for the sake of the right
possibility turning up. Besides, they can not
only talk, but act; they can chaperone her here,
and invite him there; with them it lies to throw
the young people together; and it is derogatory
to their heads only, and not to their hearts at all,
that they usually elect to do this at the wrong
times and places, and almost invariably draw
back when their aid might be efficient, through
a horrible fear that they have done already more
than is either wise or well.
But it is in winning—almost soliciting—the
first confidence from either party that they are
greatest. With the lady they take the exalted
ground of matronship, and earnest desire to see
the future of the poor wretch in the witness-box
built upon a solid, good, true, unexceptionable
foundation. This probably results either in the
lady making an abject confession, remarkable

for nothing save its lack of material and intri-
cacy—upon which the pair are safe to turn to,
and make a hideous mess of the whole thing—or
in her resenting the interference with so much of
ill-judged warmth as to make an enemy to her
plans, whatever they be, on the spot. The best
course to pursue is to listen with pleased, grati-
fied, and flattered attention to all the young
married woman says, to say nothing yourself,
and to gang your own gait afterwards, as if she
had not spoken.
But with the man it is different. There the
ground taken is the most cordial, friendly, wo-
manly interest in his welfare; desire to see him
happy, but modest reticence on the point of offer-
ing advice; and the result of this is, that the man,
unless he be a senseless block, dead to woman's
charms, is sure to bare his breast, and wear his
heart upon his sleeve before her.
“I say,” said Master Alick to his well-known
ally and friend, Beatrice Constable, as she threw
her last rolling-pin, and went to sit down upder a
tree to rest herself, “how hot you are! Serve you
right, for playing instead of telling me a story.”
“I don't know any stories, Alick.”
“That's a !” said Master Alick, solemnly
filling up the blank with portentous nods of his
curly head; “and if you tell them, you'll go—I
know where; won’t she, Mimi ?”

Mimi was a small sister of Alick's who had not
been much on the surface of society during the
evening, her attention having been principally
directed to a wide blue sash which she wore
with much unction.
Mimi had her doubts, on looking at Beatrice,
whether exception wouldn’t be made in her fa-
vor. And Alick was a naughty boy to talk about
that place, and she'd tell his aunt about him; and
did he know what it was made of?
Alick had heard, but had forgotten. Then
Mimi, having been threatened judiciously with
its terrors that day by a pious parlor-maid, whose
duster she had secreted, could tell him—it was
made of fire, and brimstone, and treacle.
“No, no, Mimi–no treacle !” interrupted
Alick, whose powers of belief would not stretch
to anything so pleasant as this last-named ingre-
dient still was to his boyish mind. “I say, come
in, Bee, and I’ll show you a paradise better than
any of them talk about; a great white rug, with
Belle, on it, in the window, with lots of fruit—
come along, Bee.”
So Beatrice followed, or rather allowed herself
to be dragged along by the boy; and when he
pushed open the drawing-room door, the faint
rays of a very much turned-down moderator
lamp fell upon the forms of Captain Tierney
and Mrs. Beresford. Before Beatrice could draw

latter—
“I can’t blame you ; but you must leave her
—you must—indeed you must.”

CHAPTER IX.
A VETERAN RECEIVES PROMOTION.
SHE went back through the hall, and out into
the garden again, at a pace that Alick and Mimi
found it hard to keep up with—those words she
had heard ringing in her ears, till her whole
head seemed like an ill-regulated peal of bells.
What could not Mrs. Beresford blame him for?
and how could anything have come to her
knowledge about that stranger that would give
Mrs. Beresford a right to blame him, and to tell
him that he “must—indeed he must’ leave
her ? (for Beatrice felt instinctively that she
was the HER alluded to in that short spasmodic
speech).
She put—after one bitterly-repented moment's
indulgence of it—the thought away from her,
that Frank could have forgotten his honor, and
spoken words of more than admiration to Mrs.
Beresford. She felt that she knew Frank already
too well to deem him guilty of that ; and she
knew that Mrs. Beresford—bright, lovely brilliant
coquette as she was—would never have spoken

dius tolerantly, had it been possible for Frank
to have forgotten himself. And yet, those words!
What did they—what could they mean? She
nearly drove herself wild with conjecture, and
impatience to get Mrs. Beresford alone, and get
it out of her.
“For she must have heard the door open and
shut again,” she thought; “and I'll tell her what
I heard, and ask her what it meant.”
“Beatrice l’” She looked up and saw it was
Walter. “I am only just out,” he said; “that
croquet's a horrid game; a fellow can’t get
out of it when he want’s to. I saw you go
into the house just now, and I’ve been in to
look for you. I expected to find you with Cap-
tain Tierney.”
“And, instead, you found Captain Tierney with
your sister, didn't you?” And then she went on—
“Yes. I have been in once, and am going in
again; now, come on.”
“What a hurry you're in ; can’t you wait a
minute?” -
“No ; the rest are going in, and they will
want us.”
“Captain Tierney didn’t seem much like want-
ing anybody when I went in to look for you just
now,” said Walter, sneeringly.
“Didn't he #" said Beatrice, with a voice she
could scarcely steady.

“No ; he was standing alone, at the window,
smoking a cigar, and looking as sulkily grand
as usual. I told him Mrs. Beresford didn’t allow
smoking in her drawing-room; and he just took
it from between his lips, and puffed out into
the garden, and then gave me one of his curs-
-edly cool looks. He didn't look much like want-
ing any one—he didn't.”
“Oh, I am very glad " answered Beatrice,
greatly relieved by hearing he was alone.
“I say, Beatrice,” said Walter, kicking up the
gravel, as they made for the hall-door, “you’re let-
ting that cousin of yours alter you altogether.”
“I hope not,” replied Beatrice; “I am sure I
thought I was very well as I was before; I don't
want to be altered.”
“I shall be glad when he's gone—the puppy,”
said Walter, savagely. -
“And I shall not,” said Beatrice.
“I wonder you acknowledge that.”
“Why shouldn't I acknowledge it? There's
no harm, and nothing to be ashamed of, in ac-
knowledging that. I shall be very sorry indeed
when a man I like better than any one, is gone.”
She could not have said all this an hour ago, but
she was strung up to the point of rushing at
anything now.
The man by her side gave a hasty exclamation
and an impatient, wrathful stamp.

“Why do you say that to me about another
man, Beatrice?” he asked, catching her hand, as
they entered the hall; “you might spare a fellow
that, I think, heartless flirt as you are.” She
looked up in his face, and—when was not a
woman softened by the love in a man's eyes?—
her cheek paled a little, and the light in her eyes
grew dimmer.
“Don’t you be cross to me, Walter,” she whis-
pered; “and don’t call me or think me a flirt;
and keep what you’ve always been—a dear old
friend to me.” And then she left him, and went
to look for his married sister. -
“I tell you what, Beatrice,” said Mrs. Beres-
ford, after a long cross-examination had been en-
dured by her—“mind, I don't know anything,
but it's my belief that you will find out in time
that Captain Tierney is not all you think him; I
hope you won't suffer from it.”
“Rubbish! what do you mean?” Beatrice
asked, getting red in the face and indignant in a
Imoment.
“Nothing—I mean nothing; whatever comes,
I have said nothing.”
“Yes, you have; you have said too much, and
too little. Why should he be what I don't think
him; and why should I ‘suffer' as you call it?
Has he confessed a murder, or the stealing of
some spoons to you, that you're so mysterious?

“I think you are mistaken. He has very good
qualities, I have no doubt; but I think you are
mistaken.”
“I can’t bear insinuations.”
“I am not “insinuating’ anything.”
“Yes, you are; and I would rather you spoke
out at once. It doesn't matter to me what he is;
only, if after your confidential chat with him,
you’ve discovered anything about my cousin,
you ought to tell me.”
Beatrice tried to look lofty.
“I can only tell you one thing, Beatrice—he's
not a marrying man.”
“I don't care for that,” said Beatrice, stoutly.
But she did. And this repetition of her own
conviction struck her heart painfully, and im-
planted a yearning desire in her breast to know
the why, and wherefore, if he was not, in truth,
a “marrying man.”
We all know what an evening party in a
country-house means, when the guests have been
assembled suddenly to come and be half out of
doors and half in. When the stars are up and
the moon has risen, every one goes in, and there
is music and conversation, and flirtation at the
open windows, and an adjournment to the sup-
per-room by-and-by, and mirth, and laughter,

and jollity, and sometimes an aching heart or
two. And so it was now, at this evening party
of Mrs. Beresford.
The hostess was quite herself again, as they
seated themselves presently, some at the table
and some away from it in still more comfortable
situations. Quite her own bright, sweet, lovely,
cheery self—for hers was a nature that rebounded
quickly, and she had apparently quite forgotten
the snappishly solemn conversation she had held
so short a time previously with Beatrice Con-
stable on the subject of Captain Tierney being
a possible victim to anybody's matrimonial
schemes.
Not so Beatricel She could not forget—and
if memory lapsed into a canter for a moment she
lashed it up into a hard gallop again—that her
friend, Mrs. Beresford, had implied by her warn-
ing that she knew something more about Bea-
trice's cousin than she (Beatrice herself) did.
And this was an aggravating, and not to be put
up with, reflection. In addition to its being ex-
quisitely painful (it always is to a woman who
loves a man) that anybody should know more
about Frank than she did herself—in addition to
this, there was the wounding fact of its being
such a very painful piece of knowledge that
Anna Beresford had seemingly attained to. Her

not know already was bad enough, but her as-
serting that he was “not a marrying man” was
positively maddening.
She did not love Frank the less for it; but the
seeds of distrust were sown in her breast by that
air dear little Mrs. Beresford put on, of extra
wisdom. And when said seeds are sown, good-
bye peace and a composed frame of mind till the
distrusted man is the husband of the woman who
loves, yet doubts.
Poor Beatrice! it would have been far better
for her if she had turned her eyes steadily away
that night from the powerful deep blue ones of
her cousin, and bent them encouragingly on a
man who, with the whole strength of his animal,
unintellectual nature, loved and worshipped her. .
She would have had years of deep peace instead
of heart-wearing anxiety; and in time she would
probably have been the mother of a troop, buxom,
stupid, and handsome as her husband and his
race. But Beatrice, not knowing what was good
for her, did not turn away from Frank and bend
her lashes on Walter, and the consequence is
that I have a story to write, which, had she done
so, I should not have had. -
He was sitting at some short distance apart
from the others; for the table was crowded, and
he had planted a fat dowager in the chair Mrs.
Beresford had indicated he was to take. Earlier

in the evening a wailing and a howling had at-
tracted his attention, and on investigating, and
finding it proceeding from Mimi and Alick res-
pectively, who were objecting to retire for the
night, he had added his voice to theirs, and peti-
tioned that they should be allowed to stay up to
supper; for which extension of their privileges
they were now thanking him to the best of
their several abilities—Mimi by graciously eating
her jelly at his knee, and dropping every second
spoonful upon him, and Alick by repeating all
he had heard everybody say to the advantage
or disadvantage of his new friend during the
evening.
“I heard Uncle Walter tell Bee Constable you
were a puppy and cursed cool l I did, Mimi !
and the swear ain’t mine; so I don’t care whether
you tell Aunt Beresford I said it or not. And
Bee Constable said she didn't care—she liked
you better than any one else. I was behind the
laurel, and I heard. What did he call you a
puppy for?”
“Can't imagine; suppose we ask him?”
“Will you ask him? Jolly!”
“No, I don’t care to; but you can, if you like,
when he comes near us.”
“So I will,” said Alick, readily. He was what
every boy of that age is—a small fiend. And so
he did when Walter came in their neighborhood,

with a boy's blithe malice and disregard of con-
sequences.
Captain Tierney got up, and stood close to his
hostess's brother.
“Look here,” he said, quietly; “I don't notice
such a remark from a man like you the first
time; but don't say it again—at least, not to my
cousin.”
“If you want to make a quarrel of a boy's
blab,” began Walter; but before he could pro-
ceed with what might have been an apology, but
probably was a defiance, Captain Tierney inter-
rupted him.
“No. I have no intention of making a quar-
rel with you in which her name could by any
possibility be introduced. I think I have said
enough. You will not call me a puppy to my
cousin again.”
And the ill-blood between the two men grew
more crimson from that moment.
“Miss Forest, I must ask you to give me a
seat home in your phaeton; three ladies driving
alone at night won’t do at all.”
“Very happy to do so; but we've the groom,
you know.”
“Ah! yes, true; but I don’t believe in grooms
very much.”
So it was arranged that Marian should go
home with her brother; and somehow or other it

was Beatrice and her cousin who occupied the
back seat of Miss Forest's phaeton.
She distrusted him—there was a “something”
holding him back from her—but she dearly
loved him, and her heart bled when he said
in his deep, repressed, but still most passionate
tones:
“I have not the smallest right or excuse to
offer an opinion about your marrying any man,
Beatrice; but you will not wrong the brotherly
interest I take in you by being angry when I say
that that clown is no fit husband for you. Don't
marry him l’’
“Is it possible that you care whom I marry,
Frank? You are so careful to impress upon me
that you abjure all interest, all claim on me,
that I wonder you care whether it's Walter Fo-
rest or not.”
He bit a piece of his moustache nearly off; but
still he was firm in not allowing himself to be
irritated into an unwary speech.
“Pardon me; I do take a great interest in
seeing you well married, which you certainly
wouldn’t be to a fellow like that. He is unedu-
cated, unpolished, illiterate; he would soon, when
“his passion shall have spent its novel force,’ hold
you ‘something dearer than his dog, a little
nearer than his horse, and that's no fate for you,
Beatrice.”

112 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
“Why doesn't he offer me another, then? I
would take any fate with him, and think it
good,” thought Beatrice, as her companion's tones
died away amidst the rolling, scrunching noise
the phaeton wheels made in going over the roads.
She was saved from the necessity of replying, by
Elinor Forest leaning back from the front seat
and talking to him; and for this interruption
Beatrice was thankful.
“Warn me against marrying Walter /* she
thought; “he might spare himself the trouble.
He need not think—though he despises me, or
something like it, for himself—that I should
marry Walter.”
The strong, overbearing, passionate love he had
shown for her that night, had not—vain as wo-
men are—worked in Walter's favor. When they
drew up in the yard, she felt displeased that he
should come up at once so eagerly to assist her
out; she gave him her hand very coldly indeed.
But displeasure vanished, and fierce dread reign-
ed in its stead, when he flung his arm round her,
agitatedly, and said—
“Don’t go home to-night, Beatrice, darling!
My mother wants you; come in.”
“What is the matter? Speak!” and “What
is the matter with papa? Oh, Walter ſ” broke
from the lips of Frank Tierney and Beatrice Con-
stable, simultaneously. And then Beatrice's face

dropped down on her hands, with a low, long,
wailing cry, for she had caught sight of Walter's
face, and she needed not to be told cautiously—
she needed not to have it gently broken to her—
she felt that her father was dead.

CHAPTER X.
HOW THE ARROWROOT BISCUIT GOT BROKEN.
“Poor girl! and my most unfortunate pre-
sence will complicate things a thousand times
more—at least it will when she has time to think;
just now, probably, she has forgotten me.”
Even in the heavy grief he was feeling for that
awfully sudden death, Frank Tierney could not
resist putting that last surmise as a feeler to Mr.
Challoner, who had been up to the Forests’ early
that morning.
On the strength of his being a clergyman,
Mrs. Forest had injudiciously thrust him into
poor Beatrice's presence, and now Frank was
anxious to hear about her. It was astonishing
to witness the thorough sympathy and perfect :
understanding which had grown up between
these two men.
Herbert Challoner shook his head, and with a
simple, loyal candor that puzzled Frank, coming
as it did from a man who loved her so devo-
tedly, said—
“No, very far from that; it is natural enough
that she should (as she does) think in her great-
est sorrow of the one who is dearest to her.”

Mr. Challoner paused, and made play with his
pocket-handkerchief— pocket-handkerchiefs fig-
ure largely in all real life tragedies—and when he
could speak without gurgling again he went
on-
“It was very touching—nothing else made her
sob so—to hear her saying that you hadn't had
time to know him well enough to love him yet.
Do you know all the mischief that can be done,
has been done? I think you should go and see
her.”
Frank Tierney’s eyes were covered with his
hands; he had his emotions wonderfully well
under command; his voice was as steady as a
rock when he answered, but he shaded his eyes
still.
“I wonder if they would let me see her ? Wo-
men in such cases generally think it right to
keep the one who is suffering up like a race-horse
in training. Well, never mind; whatever they
say, I must see her, poor miserable child ! Chal-
loner,” he continued, suddenly rising to his feet,
and holding out his hand to his friend, “you’re
a good fellow, and a pious fellow, and I respect
you for it: merge the Christian in the man for
once though, and tell me what I ought to do.”
“The duties of both are consistent,” Challoner
replied. “As you said just now, your coming
has complicated Miss Constable's position; it

- º º *-
would have been well for her, indeed, if you
had never come (not that she will ever think
so).” Frank's eyes flashed with a proud de-
light. “But as you are here you must help
her to bear her burden. We do not know yet
what her circumstances may be. It is clear
that she cannot remain at the Forests', for she
can never be Walter Forest's wife; probably
she would have been if you had not come; now
such a fate would be horrible for her. I am
not aware of her having other relations to go
to; but, at any rate, till her destination is settled
she must have you to look to for brotherly sup-
port and counsel.”
“My mother—her own father's sister—will
be the most proper person for her to be with,”
said Frank; “there can be no doubt about
that.”
“Your mother lives in Ireland, does she not?
—and you are quartered at Woolwich. Yes!
that would be the best home for her. You
wouldn't be together; you would be spared the
eternal strain on your feelings and honor, and
yet she would hear about you. If your lives
were wrenched asunder altogether, do you
know,” Challoner continued, the tears coming
into his eyes, “I believe it would kill her—I do
indeed.” -
And then the two men did what men very

frequently do when they feel a trifle too deeply
for words; they shook hands.
“I foresee a hundred annoyances for her—
and for me too—before I can get—I mean be-
fore my mother can get her away from here.
Last night, even before this fatal occurrence,
Mrs. Beresford—that fellow's sister—got hold of
me, and fired off some sententious sentences
upon the subject of raising hopes that one don't
intend to realize, and keeping other men off (a
vile phrase that virtuous women permit them-
selves to use), and the sin and wickedness of flir-
tation generally. I lost my head through an-
noyance and some conscientious pangs, and said
more than I ought to have said to stop her.
She will think she's found a mare's nest, and
Beatrice will think, through the warning shots
she will have fired at her, that I’ve a mur-
der on my mind. Now I expect the whole
family will be at me, and at her too, in hopes
of quashing — what? Good heavens ! what
never can be, therefore I’m a madman to talk
about it.”
“Wait and hope,” Challoner said; “but in
the meantime don’t compromise her. Act as you
have done hitherto, and then no one will have a
right to question or reprove.”
“Challoner, I was going to say that if the time
ever should come when I can show a portion of

the gratitude I feel to you, I’ll do it; but you
know that, don't you?”
“Take something, Beatrice; a cup o' tea, a
biscust. It's right down wicked, love, not to take
something; starving yourself will do no good;
it won't bring him back.” -
Mrs. Forest, the tears streaming from her own
kind, motherly eyes, besought Beatrice in this
wise to take tea and toast. And Beatrice—poor
wilful, bereft Beatrice—only the more resolutely
turned her face to the back of the sofa (it’s
the first thing a woman flies to in trouble, the
sofa), on which she was stretched, and refused
tea, and comforts, and toast, and the whitest of
arrowroot biscuits.
It was twelve o'clock now, on the morning
after her father's death, and she having made
them longer by a perfect hurricane of sobs, had
found the hours interminable, and had nearly
died of the bitterness she felt, that Frank, the
only one in the world she had left to love now,
had not been to her yet.
Tea 7 yes; she would take the tea by-and-by,
if Mrs. Forest would put it down to get cold;
she couldn’t take anything hot, she was burning
so already.
No biscuit; it would choke her. And would
Mrs. Forest put water on her head and go away,
please? --

Yes, Mrs. Forest would ; for just at that mo-
ment a domestic opened the door, and in that
squeakily subdued voice that weak-minded and
vulgar people invariably affect in the presence
of death or severe illness, informed Mrs. Forest
that “Captain Tierney wanted to speak to her.”
“Let him come—send him here—I want him,”
Beatrice exclaimed, springing up, and eliciting a
“lauk amassey me!” from the servant by the
rapidity of her movements and the sight of her
crimson, tear-furrowed face.
“No, Beatrice, not here—you had better not
see him.”
And then, as Mrs. Forest went out to her
visitor, Beatrice threw herself down amongst the
cushions, and sobbed with yet fiercer passion for
the dead father and the living love.
Mr. Challoner was right. The loved one is
never dearer to a woman than in what would
otherwise be an all-absorbing grief.
Elinor had been sitting at the head of the
couch all the morning, comforting her poor
friend with the best comfort a woman can give
on such occasions—with the touch of a soft,
white hand—with broken words of pity—with
tender ejaculations of love and sympathy—with
kindred sighs, and with tears many and freely
flowing (for all who knew him had loved the
brave old sailor well).

120 THE CRoss of HoNor.
But now, soon after her mother had gone out,
the door opened again; and, on looking up, in
obedience to a signal from some one apparently,
Elinor rose up, and passed out; and as she did
so her brother passed in, and took his seat by the -
side of Beatrice's sofa.
Now, under some circumstances, a little de-
ception of a mild order is not only justifiable, but
commendable. -
I think it was so in this instance. Beatrice felt
that a conversation with Walter would tend to
one end, in discomfort to both of them.
Therefore, when she heard him come in, she
pressed her face closer to the back of the couch,
softened her gulping down into regularity, and
pretended to be asleep.
Another reason for her not turning her face
round was to be found in its being much
blotched through crying.
It was unpleasant; but she quite deserved it, I
acknowledge.
Walter, finding her asleep, bent over her, and
kissed a bit of the cheek that was uppermost;
and she, feeling conscious that the bit of cheek
went of a deeper red immediately, gave up the
attempted delusion, and said, opening her eyes—
“Oh I Walter, is that you?” Then, all the
daughter's passionate, yearning love asserting
itself, she went on, “Tell me how you heard it

first when you came home last night, and
how they said he was ill—first—and all you
know.”
Then he, the rough man, softened by his love
and his sorrow, told her all he knew, so gently
and tenderly, that she lay there soothed by the
recital into passive misery, and forgot Frank.
It was the common story. He had been
through scenes of frightful carnage and days of
danger; he had been face to face with death a
thousand times, and his heart had never failed
him, or throbbed one bit the quicker, to his
knowledge.
It remained for it to fail him when, the stormy
part of his career over, he was sitting quietly in
the haven he had reached. In the midst of a
conversation with his old friend and neighbor,
Mr. Forest, there had been a struggle—a fearful,
choking fluttering—a faltered, broken blessing
on his child—and it was all over. He died of
the demon we call heart-complaint.
She heard him through it all, with a little,
low, weary sobbing; and then, when he had
finished, she felt sorry that it should be Walter
and not Frank who would be so intimately
bound up with the memory of the first details of
her sorrow.
“I wish my cousin would come in and speak,
to me, Walter,” she broke out. “It’s too hard

to keep him away from me; papa's own nephew.
Oh, poor papal Oh, dear papal”
Even as her sobs rose up again, and went forth
with the unrestrained violence of an untamed
girl's first grief, she could hear Walter's voice,
saying— -
“Beatrice, he doesn't care for you as I do, my
darling. Don’t go on like that.”
She disregarded the last part of his sentence,
and fiercely answered the first.
“He does—and it’s natural he should—my
own cousin—papa's own nephew.”
“Don’t trust him, Beatrice; he'll take you
and fling you aside if you do, like that;” and in
illustration of his cruel meaning, Walter broke
the little biscuit in two and flung it on the floor,
when Muff immediately made the best of things
as they were, by picking it up and eating it.
“How do you mean—how should he—how
dare you say that to me? He'll be my brother—
and I want a brother, for you think you may
say anything to me.”
Yes; Walter had done it now. He had lost
his cause for ever; he felt that he had, perhaps—
for at any rate he said no more.
Soon after, Beatrice's dearest wish was grati-
fied. Her cousin came in—cold as ice, but kind,
and terribly fraternal and self-possessed.
Mr. Challoner had been up, and had repre-

sented to Mrs. Forest that it would be wrong to
attempt to thwart any intercourse between the
fatherless girl and her only male relative. And
Captain Tierney had hinted that it would be his
earnest desire to see Beatrice settled with his
mother till she married. He had been unlover-
like to a degree, in fact; and as Mrs. Forest
neither desired to see Beatrice her daughter-in-
law, nor to have her (Beatrice's) heart broken by
Captain Tierney, she came round to the view of
the case he showed her, and allowed “the young
people” to have their own way.
“He evidently don't mean anything with her
himself,” she said, in answer to some remarks
Mrs. Beresford made; “for he said—or as good
as said—that he only felt towards her like a
brother.”
“Then there's something about that man I
don't like,” said Mrs. Beresford; “fluctuating in
that way looks bad. Why, he as good as told
me last night that he did care for her. Poor
dear Beel I wish she'd marry Walter.”
“Well, I'm very fond of her; but still, Walter
will want to look out for some one with enough
to stock a farm, you know.”
So—though they really, truly loved her—so
they talked her over in the first hours of her
bereavement even. -
And, in the meantime, Captain Tierney was

by her side, soothing her strangely—giving her
a feeling that, come what would, she might rely
upon him—talking of her father in terms and
tones that made sorrow so exquisite a thing that
it seemed almost a joy—but chilling her with the
conviction that he would not let himself speak
other words of love than a brother might.

CHAPTER XI.
ROBIN HOOD GOES INTO NEW HANDS.
The days passed away heavily; the long dreary
days before dust to dust, ashes to ashes, were
consigned, and Beatrice realized fully that her
father was dead.
Two or three old brother officers, men who
had been in the American war with him, came
down to see the last sad honors paid to the gal-
lant, good man, who had long ago, when they
were all young together, led them bareheaded
into action. And these had borne friendly
invitations from their wives, backed by warmer
ones from themselves, to go and “make their
house her home,” until she could decide upon
what she would do: a species of kindness
that paints more vividly than any amount of
cruelty possibly can do, the agonies of one's
position.
Beatrice thanked them “cordially” for their
coming to pay sad tribute to her father, “wea-
rily” for the kindness offered to herself. She had
“no hopes, no plans, no prospects; she did not

mean to do anything. She supposed she could
live some way or other, and if the could not, she
could”—
She paused here, for life was strong within
her, and it was hard even to say she would wil-
lingly relinquish it, although she was so utterly
crushed and cast down and broken by her filial
sorrow and her baffled love.
They shook their heads at this refusal, but
spared her the hard knowledge still of the penni-
less position in which she was placed by her fa-
ther's death. And then they went out from the
presence of the poor young orphan, and partook
of the luncheon her friends, the Forests, offered
them, and censured strongly the man who had
died before he had saved a competence for his
child out of nothing.
Letters had arrived from Ireland for both
Frank and Beatrice. Mrs. Tierney’s sentiments
were the same in both. Deep grief for her
brother's death—sorrowful satisfaction for hav-
ing, through her son, made all smooth between
them—love and pity for Beatrice, and warmly
expressed wishes to have her at once with her,
Beatrice's own father's own sister.
Beatrice had sobbed over the letters, and
loved their writer dearly, and not taking in
their meaning at all. And now it devolved
upon Captain Tierney to explain to her that

his mother's home must be hers henceforth;
and he dreaded his task, for he feared that
Beatrice would refuse to go to his mother, in
resentment against him for the cold manner
he compelled himself to adopt towards her.
If she did this, he would be obliged to make
a disclosure to her that would wound her still
more; the disclosure that it was not in her
power any longer to choose her place of abode:
the disclosure, hardest of all to make and
hear, that the means of doing so were hers no
Inlore.
“Beatrice,” he said, coming into the room
where she sat alone, with an open letter in his
hand, “I go up to town this afternoon, to meet
my mother, and settle her in a house for a time.
She is very anxious to have you with her... Say
you will give her that pleasure soon—in a few
days—I will come back for you.”
“Why can’t Aunt Tierney come down and
live with me—for a time—till she gets tired of
me, like—like you have I shall never leave
Broome. I shall never leave the house dear papa
died in. No, Frank, I won't go?”
Just what he had anticipated; still he hardly
knew how to deal with the case. Her resentful
love, so plainly shown, redoubled his difficulties,
deepened the claim on his honor to save her
from its ill effects—made him fonder of her than

he was before—and plunged him into a more
unfathomable sea of regret, remorse, and sorrow
for the past.
“Beatrice!” he began, sitting down by her on
the couch, and taking her hand in his, “have I
not promised—and have you not accepted my
promise—to be the brother you have not, to
you? You must not make me break that
promise, Beatrice. You must not refuse such
poor assistance as I can offer you. God knows
it's little enough—it consists solely in bearing
you safely and speedily to the only protection
right for you to be under now—that of your fa-
ther's sister. It would not be right for you to
continue to live at Broome by yourself; and I
do not think I make a mistake in thinking that
you would not like to continue in this house,
fond as you are of the Miss Forests. No, dear
Beatrice, you must go to my mother, and that
soon, if the idea of my mother is not repugnant
to you.”
“You only say all this because you think you
ought to say it. If you don’t care for me to go,
who have seen me, more than Aunt Tierney
does, who has not, why then I’ll stay where I am.
I won't go anywhere simply because it would
be best. Do you care for me to go, Frank?”
She asked it suddenly, placing both her hands
in his, as she turned and faced him.


## p. 129 (#139) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 129
“Yes—I look upon myself as your guardian,
and I should suffer tortures if my ward were out
of reach of my supervision.”
The flash of hope with which she had asked
the question died out, and she sighed heavily, as
she answered—
“Then I will be ready to go to Aunt Tierney,
Frank, whenever you can come back and take
me. What shall I do with the house—lock
it up "
“Leave all that to me,” said her cousin. He
could not tell her yet that her household gods
must go.
Captain Tierney executed his mission to Lon-
don with surprising rapidity. He had taken
rooms in a gloomy but respectable—even more
than that—house; installed his mother in them,
and gladdened the heart of that haughty dame,
by proving to her, from a district map, that
she was located in the aristocratic region of
South Belgravia; and then he had travelled
down to Broome again, and all this was done
within the week. -
He had told Beatrice so cleverly that it
“would be better to sell the things—they would
only be a bore to her”—that Beatrice had no
idea the selling them was a thing of need;
she had not given one thought to money matters
as yet.

Accordingly, when Frank asked her to go
over with him and say what things she would
like kept back from the auction, that was to
take place immediately after their departure,
she very sensibly, and with great womanly taste,
selected all the most valuable and prettiest things
in the house.
“And about Robin Hood, Frank? dear old
vicious pet that he is—can’t I take him up to
town with me?”
Now it was Frank's fixed determination, that
while he could do it, without alarming her pride,
Beatrice should never know what it was to
want a sum wherewith to gratify any reasonable
caprice. But he had just taken heavy expenses
upon himself, in the shape of the proper esta-
blishment and style he had resolved upon keep-
ing up for his mother and cousin. Therefore,
Robin Hood—representing, as he would do, in
London, another sixty pounds annual disburse-
ment—was an impossibility.
“I don't see how you could have him in town,
Beatrice. You couldn’t ride him, you know.
When you ride you must hire till I can get a
good horse for you.”
“Would he cost very much in London?”
“More than the use he would be is worth, I
am afraid you would find.”
“If I don't have him to drive myself, Frank,”

she began nervously; “I couldn't—no, I really
couldn’t " She stopped with the tears in her
eyes.
“What ?”
, “Know that any one else had him Papa
gave him to me. I couldn’t be happy to think
anybody rode and drove him. I had rather he
was killed.”
“Put a price upon that pony of Miss Con-
stable's, will you?” said Captain Tierney, later
in the day, to Walter Forest; “I know you are
a good judge of a horse.”
“What do you think of five-and-twenty I
have had a breaker go and look at him; for I
mean to have him.”
“Very fair, I suppose,” answered Frank; “but
I am afraid you will be disappointed. I have
promised my cousin that no one else shall have
Bobin Hood.”
“Oh, indeed!” replied Mr. Walter Forest,
gruffly, turning away on his heel, as he muttered
something relative to the good qualities he hoped
Captain Tierney would discover in Robin Hood
when he tried him in the streets—hopes, the ex-
pression of which Captain Tierney entirely dis-
regarded. - *
Poor little Robin Hood l Unconscious little
bay! How sweet those oats were that he was
eating that evening when Captain Tierney
entered his stable. -

“Saddle him, sir?” asked the boy, interroga-
tively, as Frank went up and patted the pony.
“He’s in rare good condition, sir,” he continued,
loquaciously. “Miss Beatrice have never rid nor
driv him hard, you see—not cruel hard, like some
ladies do. Mr. Walter will have his money's
worth of work out of him.”
“Who told you Mr. Walter Forest was going
to have him f*
“Mr. Walter himself, sir,” replied the boy,
with the brisk delight boys usually experience at
imparting an unknown (as they imagine) piece
of intelligence.
“Put on his halter, and lead him out into the
yard,” said Frank; “you'll find me there.”
He went out, and stood smoking his cigar over
the very gate he had seen Bee and her father
leaning over that first morning. And as he stood
there, thinking, with more sadness than was his
wont, of what was past, over, and not to be re-
called, some rapid pattering steps roused him,
and the little pony, looking better groomed and
more full of life than usual, was lead out to him.
“Is he going away to-night, sir?” asked the
boy, who had groomed Robin Hood all the time
he had been in Beatrice's service. “Is he going
away at onest, sir? He's a rare good’un, he is.”
“Yes, he's going away,” said Frank, rather
absently. “Go and look for old Beevish; tell
him I’m ready for him.”

Old Beevish had acted as knife-cleaner, bottle-
washer, clothes-brusher, and gardener to Captain
Constable; and this morning, before daybreak,
he had been employing one of his versatile talents
In an uncommon way.
“Come along, Beevish,” said Captain Tierney
when the old man presented himself, looking
mournful and uncomfortable. “Come along,
Beevish ; I am going to do it myself.”
“And right glad I am, sir, that you don't
make the job over to me,” the old man said, with
a relieved air. “I’ve seen her drive her pa out
along o' that pony too many a time, sir, to care
to put him out of the way myself.”
It was at the further end of a little paddock
that the grave was dug–where the paddock
ended, in fact, and a plantation commenced. A
tall, dark, royal Scotch fir kept guard at the
head, and a yellow-haired acacia drooped lov-
ingly over the foot of the deep, long hole where
the little bay fell down without a cry. Poor
little Robin Hood the shot that killed him
pained him less than it did the heart of the one
who aimed it. But he as little as Beatrice could
have borne that any other man should have
owned her pony. *.
Miss Constable, with Captain Tierney for her
escort, was to leave Broome by six o'clock in the
morning, in order to catch an early train, and to

be in London before the shades of murky night
made things doubly depressing. They were a
gloomy group that watched her away—a gloomy,
tearful group; for she had been a great pet and
favorite, and the conviction came home to the
dullest among them, in those parting moments,
that clouds would surely lower over the bright
young head that had hitherto been held so high,
before they met again.
They had arranged—Beatrice and Elinor had—
a rigorous system of correspondence; they were
to write to each other three times a-week, with a
long letter on Sundays thrown in, and they were
to tell each other everything they did; and all
the new dresses, especially as regarded the
sleeves, that came into their possession, were to
be fully described.
Beatrice was to come and stay with the
Forests at Christmas; Elinor was to go and stay
with her in the spring. Still, for all these pleas-
ant plans of future intercourse, they felt that
saying good-bye to Beatrice was a very sad thing
indeed.
Herbert Challoner was there, too, to see her
off.
“You’ll always remember me if you want
anything done that I can do—won't you, Miss
Constable?” he said, as he took her hand for a
moment. “And your cousin has been kind

enough to give me your address, and to say I
may call when I come to town.”
“Yes, I will; and do come,” Beatrice an-
swered, eagerly; the man's unselfish devotion to
her touched her keenly. “You are the kindest
and best friend I could have. I shall always be
glad to see you—always feel sure that I can de-
pend upon you. Good-bye, and thank you for
many things.” *
Before he had cleared his eyes of a certain
dimness that her last words had brought over
them, she was gone; and he saw the Forests
waving their hands to her, in last adieu.
She did not speak till they were long clear of
the village; then she looked up, wistfully, and
said— -,
“There are two or three things, Frank, that I
ought to have asked before; one is, who bought
my poor little pony?—and what he made?”
“His price was thirty guineas,” Frank said,
looking straight ahead of him, in vain attempts
not to see the spray on her eyelashes.
“And who bought him?”
“You did not wish any one to have him,
Bee.”
“No, no; papa gave him to me. Papa had
notions about things being all your own, and
ever your own; and he gave those notions to me.
I can't bear to think that any one else has my

pony that papa gave me; I would rather know
he was dead.”
“He is, Beatrice; I shot him.”
She did not speak; but he saw her eyes light
up with a dangerous glow for the man who was
bent upon not being burnt by it; and she laid
her hand on his arm, with a quick, passionate
clasp.
“You are not angry with me?” he whispered.
And her answer was—
“Frank, Frank I 'twas a good fate for Robin
Hood. Angry with you! Don't you think I can
appreciate your motives better—though you try
to mislead me sometimes?”
“Beatrice,”—he turned pale even for Frank
Tierney, “don’t, for Heaven's sake, be misled,
or mislead yourself.”

CHAPTER XII.
MRs. TIERNEY “could HAve wishED THINGS HAD
BEEN DIFFERENT.”
MRs. TIERNEY was getting nervously impatient
for the arrival of the travellers. She was one of
those women who can stand great trials and sor-
rows and reverses, nobly and uncomplainingly;
but she was apt to get unhappy and utterly des-
pondent about the minor ills and inconveniences
of life, and I am by no means inclined to think
hers an exceptional disposition. She had ex-
pected them to appear at ten minutes past four,
and here the minute hand was jerking itself
spasmodically to the twelve, and a groaning con-
vulsion was commencing in the interior, which
warned her that the gilt wood-cutter was about
to strike five distinct blows.
The room in which Mrs. Tierney awaited the
advent of her son and her niece, was a square,
moderately-sized apartment, lighted by two win-
dows, both of which were decorated with that
paucity which marks furnished lodgings gen-
erally; the green damask curtain on one side,

that is to say, was balanced only by a holey
netted one on the other, as if the supply of either
damask or ready-money had run short when the
adornments of the room were in hand. There
were a couple of comfortable, wide sofas; two or
three easy-chairs; a round table in the centre of
the room, now covered with a dinner-cloth, and
much electroplate and heavy glass; a sideboard
cheffonier; a carpet and hearthrug, tastefully
embellished with improbably large roses; a small
round stand, supporting a huge glass globe, full
of wax flowers, of the conventional water-lily
and moss-rose type; an enormous chimney glass,
the frame of which was concealed from the gaze
of the profane by ingeniously cut yellow paper;
several ladies with little on save bandeaus of
ribbon passed through their hair, and crooks in
their hands, and gentlemen in buff waistcoats
and blue coats, on the wall; and a profusion of
second-rate cracked china, riveted in all sorts of
unexpected places, which caused the accidental
toucher of it much nervous anguish. Altogether,
it was not a room to make the moments fly, and
the waiting a thing of joy.
Mrs. Tierney had her brother's lofty stature,
and her brother's fair, handsome face. The large
grey eyes were the same as his had been in shape
and color; but the expression was different; they
betrayed the most indomitable pride, and this

not occasionally, but usually. Her mouth was
handsomely curved, but the upper and lower
lips contradicted each other strangely; the
former had the haughty, determined curve of a
resolute, proud woman; the latter had the strong,
flat compression of one who had been used to
keep that resolution and pride under.
She was sitting now on one of the wide sofas,
with her feet stretched out, and resting upon a
fender-stool.
Her mourning dress of paramatta, heavily
trimmed with crape, had only existed three days;
yet now, through that extraordinary faculty some
women have of shabbying their toilette at once,
it looked worn and untidy. It was fastened ir-
regularly; a hook had been hitched into a fold
of crape, and had been twitched away in such
haste that the fold hung in a rag. The band of
rep silk had been put on carelessly; consequently,
on the right side it was twisted inside out; and
the jet buckle was not fastened in the centre of
her waist. -
Her collar was brooched a one-side; her hair
—her luxuriant brown, but slightly streaked with
grey, hair—was knotted, under her cap, loosely
behind, and allowed to fall in careless loops on
her well-shaped cheeks. Her long, slender feet
were thrust into boots, the laces of which trailed
over the hearthrug. In fact, as she sat there in

-
a position of haughty ease, in her mature beauty
she might have been taken as a model for the
goddess of untidyness.
Presently she heard a cab draw up at the door,
and, rising, she advanced, with a sweeping
stateliness of step that would have caused the
most critical observer to forget her shortcomings
as to neatness, to the door, which she threw open,
and then paused to welcome her own son, and
her dead brother's child, as Frank Tierney, Esq.,
and one who came for protection to Mrs. Tier-
ney, of Tierney Castle, should be welcomed.
A light step on the stairs—a rustle of female
garments—and Beatrice stood before her.
“Welcome to my heart, my own dear brother's
child—and to the home—poor as it is—that I
have to offer you here.”
The words were kind—more than that, but
they savored something of making a speech,
—the tone in which they were uttered was de-
lightful—a rich, soft accent pervaded them, and
gave them grace and point. - -
The embrace Mrs. Tierney bestowed upon her
niece was perfection—stand where you would,
you would have seen no angular line; but, for all
that, Beatrice would have liked it better if her

pleasure to come into her eyes, when the veil

Beatrice had shrouded her face in during her
journey was removed.
“Will you just throw your bonnét off here,
dear, or will you like to go to your room before
dinner?” Mrs. Tierney asked, and then paused’
for Beatrice's answer, with her hand on the bell.
“Whichever you like,” Beatrice replied, wear-
ily. The room appeared to her stuffy and close;
—a feeling had come over her, since she came
into the presence of Frank's mother, that was
more than fatigue—it was perfect lassitude.
“Ah, then, you’ll like to go. Take Miss Con-
stable to her room,” she continued to the servant,
who came in behind a huge leg of mutton; “and
you, Frank, wait here, while I speak to you.”
As soon as the door closed behind Beatrice,
Mrs. Tierney addressed her son, as follows:
“Frank 1 I could have wished things had been
different.” º
“So could I, mother—many things; but what
are you specially alluding to now?—the room, or
the dinner we are to have? or the increasing in-
aptitude Tierney Castle betrays for keeping one
brick upon another ?”
“Do not scoff, Frank, at the misfortunes which,
if you were what I always prayed you might be,
would crush you to the earth. The downfall
of the name, power, and home of the Tierneys
is no subject for joking. I was not thinking

about our great trials, though, at the moment.
I was thinking about poor Maurice's daughter.
Frank, you never told me your cousin was a
beautiful girl.”
“To answer your first remarks first, my dear
mother—really, you were very good to do such
violence to your maternal feelings, but, I must
say, I rejoice that your prayers did fail, for I
have no desire to be crushed to the earth. As
to the other, I suppose you never reminded me
of Beatrice being a very pretty girl by asking
me what she was like. Her beauty, surely,
though, can't be one of the things you could
wish different—it is just of the order to be
very successful. Remember, her face is her
fortune, and she must marry wealthily, in addi-
tion to well.”
Mrs. Tierney rose, and placed one hand on
the shoulder of her son; and the pride in her
eyes deepened, and the compressed lip grew
sterner as she said—
“Frank, my boy, you're the only one of the
old stock left—of the old race I learnt to revere
when I was a very young girl—all the good
that can ever come back to the old name must
come through you, Frank. Are you trying to
deceive me?—do you really mean that your
cousin, as your words imply, is only your cousin
to you? or do you risk setting me against the

child, who has only me to take care of her now,
by nourishing a warmer feeling for her? Speak,
Frank | To do so would be ruin.”
She spoke passionately, with imperious warn-
ing, with tones and looks that she would sooner
have cut her tongue out than that a third
person should have heard her use to her son,
the sole representative of the old race she so
esteemed.
“Aye, mother; greater ruin even than you
think,” he replied, turning from her with a ges-
ture of miserable impatience.
And as he turned, he saw that the door had
just opened, and that Beatrice had come into
the room. “How much has she heard 7" was
the thought that flashed like lightning through the
brains of both ambitious mother and despondent
son. And the thought threw confusion over
both of them, for none better understood than
did Mrs. Tierney the duties of hospitality.
Beatrice had heard, almost without hearing,
the last few words of her aunt's address to Frank,
and she had not heard more than the three first
words of Frank's answer to his mother.
Therefore, woman like, she put the two to-
gether, and drew a wrong deduction from the
combination. <
“It's his duty to his mother keeps him from
telling me how he loves me,” she thought; “I

suppose she wants him to marry some dreadful
woman with money, in order that punch may
flow as of old about Castle Tierney. What a
shame of her!”
Before she had eaten her first slice of mutton,
she had decided that it would be quite fair to
win Frank from his mother, if she could. Be-
fore the pudding came, she was confident that a
small home in England, with her, would be a far
more preferable fate for a man than a residence
in a tumble-down castle in Ireland, with a care-
lessly arrayed lady for the mistress of his abode.
As she eat her cheese, she saw herself gradually
conquering all Aunt Tierney’s small objections
—as she won that lady, surely, by the charm
that had never failed her yet. And in the even-
ing, when she rested on the sofa, and Frank came
and talked to her, she felt happier than she had
done for many a long day.

CHAPTER XIII.
“B U Y. A D A w G, M A R M.”
The sounds which aroused Beatrice from the
dreamless sleep into which she had tumbled im-
mediately on getting into bed the previous night
were unmistakably Celtic.
“Mee lady, mee lady! will ye wake an tell
me whether it's still slapeing ye’ll be; or will ye
get up, and go down and make tay for the cap-
tain 3’”
Beatrice opened her eyes and smiled an
assent into the round, flat, befreckled face of a
potato-visaged daughter of Erin, who stood over
her couch.
“I’ll get up. Come here and tell me what
your name is?”
“Norah Donovan, from the county Cork. Ah!
now ; will ye get up !" *
“Yes,” replied Beatrice, “of course I will;
you're Mrs. Tierney's—my aunt's—own maid,
that she has brought with her, I suppose.”
“It's just that I am,” said Norah, mournfully
folding her arms across her breast, and nodding

her head solemnly; “and I'm thinking that I
shall turn the kay on your ladyship's honor,
for-saints be good to us—it's the moighty rage
she'll be in when she finds ye won’t do as she
bids ye.”
“But she-my aunt, I mean—has not bid me
do anything, Norah. What do you mean? what
does she want me to do?”
“Only not to fatigue yourself by getting up;
be aisy now, and stay in bed, like the mistress,
till twelve.” -
“Nonsense, Norah; you're a kind girl to be
afraid I’ll fatigue myself,” said Beatrice, laugh-
ing; “but I will take care of that ; at the
same time,” she continued merrily, as the absurd-
ity of her aunt's so soon commencing precau-
tionary measures with regard to restricting the
intercourse between Frank and herself, struck
her, “I mean to go down and make the cap-
tain's tay, and you may go back and tell aunt so,
with my love.”
And then, as Norah backed out of the room
—not at all with the intention of putting this
last behest into execution—Beatrice rose, with
the light-hearted conviction that one thing would
be in her favor, viz., a deep-rooted aversion to
early rising on the part of her aunt.
Inactive people lose a great deal of pleasure in
this world by coming in at the tag end of most

agreeable things, which have been, naturally
enough, seized upon by the prompt ones, and al-
ready exhausted.
Of course it is very annoying to them to ar-
rive at the knowledge that they are late for such
loaves and fishes as they may have anticipated
sharing in ; but, through it all, they have one
comfort—and that not a slight one—they have
not hurried themselves.
Premature heart-complaint is not theirs, by
reason of their having put on much speed; their
coming at all is futile, but then they have not
come in hot haste.
On the other hand, active people very usually
overshoot the mark, and exhaust their energies
by waiting wearily for that event towards which
they have tumultuously hurried, in terrible fear
of being too late.
Every one knows this phase of feeling: how
one rushes up in an agitated dog-trot, and pal-
pitatingly congratulates one's self on being in
such nice time. How shortly a doubt will dart
into one's mind as to whether the promptitude,
punctuality, and speed one has exhibited has
been either necessary or desirable. How grad-
ually the conviction deepens, and becomes a firm
one, that the works on which one has lately
prided one's self have been those of supereroga-
tion. How heavily the time one has gained by

one's activity passes. How weary the moments
of waiting are. How disgusted, finally, one feels,
not only with the rest of the world, but with
one's self.
Beatrice sat alone, on one of the wide sofas,
before the cold, cheerless breakfast-table. Why
is it, that a breakfast-table, in a lodging, always
looks cold and cheerless? And, sitting there, she
‘experienced some of the sensations I have en-
deavored to portray in the foregoing paragraphs.
She had dressed herself quickly, and the view
from her bedroom window not being remarkably
pleasing—it looked out on the leads, and a black
tom-cat, with a bang tail—she had not lingered
long, but had at once, when ready, gone down to
see what prospect of domestic felicity the room
she had thought rather cheerless the night before,
afforded in the morning light.
She drew a blank at once. Frank was not there;
it had never occurred to her that he would be
late, and that her haste would gain her nothing
but an uninterrupted enjoyment of the room.
She poured herself out a cup of tea that she
could not sweeten enough, and then looked round
for something to wile away the time.
Of course she found nothing. Who ever found
more in a just recently hired furnished apartment?
“Poor little Muff!” she thought, “I wish I
had brought you;” for she had left Muff with

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 149
Elinor Forest, no special invitation having been
accorded to the dog.
Thoughts of Muff brought back other thqughts,
and Beatrice began to feel a rising in her throat
and a tightness in her eyeballs.
“How unkind of them to leave me to myself
in this way !” she exclaimed, indignantly rising,
and brushing away the tears; and as she said it,
Frank entered.
Now he was come, she forgot that she had
been waiting for him.
“Ah, Frank, I thought you wouldn’t be lazy,
so I refused to have my “tay” in bed, as Aunt
Tierney (through Norah) requested me to. Do
you know, I was just getting dull, though, and
wishing—for whom do you imagine *
He would not guess; even in joke he could
not bear to believe that Beatrice had wished for
any other presence than his own; his mother's
remarks had stung him the night before—stung
him into imprudence nearly.
“Beatrice,” he began, “don’t harass a fellow,
if you can help it; you have not been wishing for
any one you have left behind you, have you? say.”
“I have, indeed; for Muff.”
“Oh! Muff. Well, I promise you shall have
a better dog than Muff before the day is over.
Will you try to like it as well ?”
“Do you mean you will give me one, Frank?”


## p. 150 (#160) ############################################

150 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
“Yes, if you will do me the honor of accepting
an offering from me.”
“Then I shall like it better than Muff,” she
said, frankly; and then, the dog question being
settled, they sat down to breakfast, and Captain
Tierney mentally swore that he “would go down
to his quarters to-night.”
One benefit decidedly accrues from making a
good resolution—whether that resolution is kept
or not—viz., the maker of it feels so satisfied and
pleased with him, or herself; so justified in re-
warding the resolution as to the future with the
present indulgence.
It causes the maker of it to feel lighter-hearted
at once, better pleased with the world and him-
self, and fully entitled to enjoying the goods that
are going at the time.
So it came to pass that Captain Tierney had no
sooner decided that it behooved him to remove
himself from the dangerous presence of his fair
cousin, and that the deed should be done that
night, than he gave himself up to a freer and
more unfettered enjoyment of her most charming
society than he had ever permitted himself to in-
dulge in before.
“Would you not like to have a walk, Bea-
trice f" he said to her, when the breakfast-table
had been cleared for at least half-an-hour, and
all thoughts of fulfilling the promise she had

made to “go and see her aunt” had apparently
vanished entirely from the surface of her mind.
“Would you not like to have a walk, Beatrice?
You'll find it dull waiting here for my mother;
she never gets up early.”
“Very much indeed, Frank; for, to tell the
truth, I can’t feel at home in this room yet; it's
full of nothing but tables and chairs, and cracked
china; nothing to take up and put down again.
I shall litter some of my things about it pre-
sently, and then I shall like it better, I daresay.”
“But there is another place they call a draw-
ing-room,” said Frank; “at least, there was
when I took the place, I know; for I remember
thinking, when you had, as you say, littered some
of your things about that, it would be rather
habitable. We will go and look at it.”
So they went to look at it. And over the
transposing of furniture, and re-arranging of
some, and abolishment of other ornaments—for
Beatrice had the true womanly quality of mak-
ing the best of things—they grew more confiden-
tial than ever. The tight band round Beatrice's
heart became an elastic one as the fact grew
more transparent that Frank had taken the bit
between his teeth at last.
“This shall be my special corner,” she said,
wheeling a little chess-table in front of a small
couch which she had drawn up into a cosy posi-

tion in the corner, between one of the windows
and the end of a grand piano. Look, Frank, I
shall further fortify it with my wool-work frame;
and then with my desk on this stand, and the
dog you are going to give me on that peculiar
little ottoman, this nook will be comfort itself.
There will be just room for you to sit on that end
of the couch and read. I shall never admit
ladies; their voluminous robes would disturb my
arrangements. Aunt Tierney will have the rest
of the room; but I shall maintain my corner in-
tact. Don’t you think it a good plan º'
“Capital,” Frank replied, looking down ad-
miringly on the bright head that was raised in
earnest endeavor to put the case fully and clearly
before him. “Beatrice,” he added, suddenly,
“do make the place as comfortable—more than
that—as charming as you can; or else my mother
will take it into her head that she's not lodged
according to her dignity, and will want to be off
to the castle; and just fancy how dull it would
be for a fellow up here then.”
To judge from the expression of Beatrice's
eyes, the idea of the flight back to the castle,
that she had once felt poetical about, was no
more pleasant to her than to him.
“Now you had better get ready if we are to
have anything of a walk, for I must be off to
Woolwich some time to-day.”

When Miss Constable had arrayed herself in
walking costume, she bethought herself of that
visit to her aunt that she had promised to pay;
she knocked at the door of that lady's room in a
determined little way, that would have said to
the initiated, plainly as any words could have
done, “I come prepared to combat any objec-
tions you may raise to my going out with your
son.”
But Mrs. Tierney was not a woman to waste
her ammunition in firing small volleys; she re-
served her strength for the time it might be re-
quired. At present she saw, that for some reason
or other unknown to her, Frank was to be trusted
with Beatrice. By-and-bye that unseen obstacle
might be removed, and then, then she would put
forth her maternal powers for her “boy's good,”
of course. -
So, when Beatrice had told her she was going
out with Frank, for a walk, Mrs. Tierney simply
replied— -
" .. Very well, dear; don’t go too far and tire
yourself.”
They came through two or three streets out
into St. James's Park, and from thence into Pic-
cadilly. At Apsley House the string of carriages
and equestrians going in for the morning drive
and ride, was too continuous for them to cross at
once, so they stood there; and as they waited,
7+

they became the objects of attention to two very
different people.
The one was a vendor of small, made-up ani-
mals, curled and combed into the semblance of
various good-bred dogs, who addressed Beatrice
in the tones of his trade with “Buy a dawg,
marm?” -
The other was a lady who roused herself from
her inert attitude in her splendidly-appointed
brougham, to lean forward and gaze at the hand-
some pair, who stood there so unconscious of her
observation. - -
The mercantile offer of the first, even Beatrice,
anxious as she was for a dog, repelled with scorn;
for she saw, at a glance, the dogs were not worth
much. Of the lady's attention they were, as I
said before, unconscious. Then there came an
opening in the line, and they crossed over, and
made for the chairs that stand in long rows along
the lower drive. - -
The lady in the brougham—a mignonne woman,
with pale, straw-colored hair, and large, innocent
blue eyes—with a fair, blush-rose complexion,
and the pouting mouth of a child—drew the
checkstring, and then leaning out, made a gesture
that attracted the vendor of dogs to her carriage
window.
“Here!” she said, speaking very rapidly, and
lifting, as she spoke, a small white silvery dog,

with a peculiar fawn-colored cross on his head,
up in her arms; “take this dog, and offer it for
sale to that same lady, or to the gentlénan, you
spoke to this moment. They won’t buy him, I
know ; but you go and offer him. You must
bring him back to me, at the other end of the
drive, and then I'll give you ten shillings. It's
no use your stealing the dog, for I would pay
any price to hunt you down, if you did,” she
continued, frankly. “Now go; be quick,” she
added, imperiously, as the man took the dog and
ventured to wink in appreciation of the perfect
understanding he had of his mission.
Then the mignonne lady with the lovely eyes
drove rapidly into the Park. Fate favored her;
there came a block just opposite to Frank and
Beatrice. She saw the dog—the white dog with
the fawn-colored cross, offered to Beatrice—she
saw her pat it—she heard her tones of admira-
ration—she saw Frank Tierney bend down, and,
examining the dog and his collar, she saw him
start up into an erect position and exclaim,
“Come on, Beatrice, the dog's stolen l’’ and then
she drove on, laughing, to the other end, to await
the return of her property.

CHAPTER XIV.
T H E G B O S S OF G O L D.
“IT's a miserable life,” said the fair little lady
in the brougham, abruptly changing from her
laughing mood—“a miserable life,” she con-
tinued, apostrophising the white dog with the
fawn-colored cross on his forehead, who was
perched up in the circular seat in front of her,
blinking feebly. “And I haven’t the comfort,
Floss, of thinking that I have only myself to
blame for it—I’ve everybody to blame but my-
self.” And then the lady shed a few tears, and
dried them gracefully on an embroidered pocket-
handkerchief.
The brougham drew up at the private door of
a large pickle and preserve warehouse in Picca-
dilly, and the lady got out and dismissed it, and
then went up to the huge “apartments” she had
hired at an extravagant rate because it was in a
gay place, and she thought she would never
“be dull.” And when she got up in the draw-
ing-room she sat down, and nursed the dog, and
cried over him, and talked to him as women

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 157
who are unhappy, and alone, will cry, and talk
even to dumb animals.
“What a sweet, bright, honest face she had,
Floss—and she leant on his arm as if it belonged
to her. I am sure he will not break his vow,
though; and I can't—no, I can’t release him
from it. He must come round to love me again
in time, because he loved me so well once. Oh!
Floss, Floss! did you do what I prayed you
might—remind him of me kindly?”
At this juncture the street door was assailed
in that violent manner of which London footmen
alone are capable.
“Visitors I” she exclaimed, springing up and
dropping the dog, and, with the unconscious per-
fidy of a polished woman, beaming an antici-
patory smile; “what in the world did I come
home early for, to be bored with visitors at
this hour?”
But none of this sentiment appeared in her
face when the visitor, a short elderly lady, with
gigantic respectability, and fashionable mother-
liness impressed upon every feature, advanced
into the room and gave her hand in cordial greet-
ing to, and received a cordial grasp of welcome
from, Mrs. Arden.
“How kind of you to come and see such a
poor little dull mouse !”
“You naughty child!—I was afraid you had

taken it into your foolish little head to be off out
of town without giving me a word of warning,”
were the sentences interchanged between the
hostess and her guest. And then they kissed
each other, and sat down, smiling benignly, upon
a couch, in affectionate proximity, and com-
menced a little friendly warfare, in the way of
light skirmishing attacks and cleverly parried de-
fences.
“Arthur is staying with me for a few days,”
was the throwing-off shot, just to start the game,
with which the visitor broke ground. She said
it with the most utter and entire absence of in-
terested emphasis on a single syllable; but, at
the same time, she bent down to pat Floss, and
by so doing she brought Mrs. Arden's face more
completely before her.
“Is he?” returned Mrs. Arden, and the care-
lessness in her tones was no effort, as Mrs.
Sketchley read in her eyes; “how very glad you
must be to have him home again.”
This was all very kind, and proper, and cor-
rect; but though the words would have done,
the tones were not such as an anxious mother
would desire to hear from the lips of a rich
young widow, with regard to her (anxious mo-
ther's) promising son who had intentions of
“trying it on in that quarter.” Mrs. Sketchley
settled her skirts and readjusted her laces; gave

Floss a sharp pat on his head that might have
been intended in a friendly spirit, but which
Floss took leave to resent by snapping and de-
pressing his tail in wrath; and then returned to
the charge.
“Glad 1 of course I am—more than glad, to
have my boy at home again; but I fear his re-
turn to England will not be for his happiness—
poor fellow !”
It is a very difficult thing—a situation of ex-
treme peril and danger—to talk to a proud mo-
ther about her pet son; she is sure to think you
say too much or too little.
“Why did he come back, then?” asked Mrs.
Arden. “Poor Floss! poor dear old dog!”
“May, I hardly know whether even a mother
is justified in betraying the secret her maternal
solicitude has surprised. Still, I know you so
well, dear May, and I trust you so tho-
roughly?
“Oh I pray don’t, Mrs. Sketchley,” interrupt-
ed May Arden, hastily. “I really think that you
wouldn’t be justified, or anything of the sort;
it's so wrong to mention anything—anything
that you find out, I mean—to anybody who isn't
interested—that is, particularly interested—in
the affair. And though, of course, I like Cap-
tain Sketchley very much, as your son, I have
no claim to hear his secrets.” -


## p. 160 (#170) ############################################

160 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
She spoke abruptly, and in rather broken, dis-
jointed accents; but broken and disjointed as
they were, they were terribly in earnest.
“I tell you what it is, May,” Mrs. Sketch-
ley began, in a heightened tone, to match the
heightened color on her cheeks, “you are
hankering after that, that worthless, heartless
scou.”
“Don’t call him hard names—don't call him
coarse, hard names to me, Mrs. Sketchley; be-
cause I won't stand it, even from you. Stop;
you need not ask me anything, for I will tell
you without asking. I have seen him to-day
in the Park, with a lady on his arm, that I
am sure from his manner he loves. And for
all that, and though it stabbed me, I can’t
give him up; I can’t give up the hope of re-
gaining him in some way or other. I loved
him so that I descended to the use of threats
when he wanted to break with me; and do you
think, after that, that my love can be lightly
turned from its channel and made to flow to-
wards your son ?”
“May 1 May 1 this is a terrible, a wicked in-
fatuation. After a man has treated you as ho
has treated you, to go on wasting your life and
your love upon him in this way, I have no pa-
tience with you.”
There was genuine truth and fervor in this

last part of the sentence, at any rate. Mrs.
Sketchley, with a selfishly extravagant, noto-
riously wild son perpetually weighing upon
lier mind, and keeping her wits upon the
alert in frequently futile spasmodic endeavors
to screen him from his father's indignation
—Mrs. Sketchley, I repeat, under these circum-
stances was not likely to have a large meed
of patience with a rich and pretty woman, who
persisted in disregarding his suit and clinging
to some very unsatisfactory old memories.
“I have no patience with you, May,” she con-
tinued, wagging her head with womanly con-
tempt of, and want of toleration for, another
woman, whose feelings and heart, hopes and de-
sires, she could no more have fathomed than the
curled lapdog at her feet. “And as for him, I
would not marry Captain Tierney—no, not if he
came and went *— º
“Came and what f° interrupted Mrs. Arden.
“And went down upon his bended knees be-
fore me,” wound up Mrs. Sketchley, with the
triumphant energy of a person who, despite a
certain laxity in the construction of the sentence,
has succeeded in saying her say.
Mrs. Arden shook her bright little fair head,
round which the wavy hair was so gracefully
and neatly banded, and laughed merrily, in spite
of the sorrow at her heart.

“He would never do anything so stagey and
stupid, believe me, Mrs. Sketchley; your ro-
mantic heart and eyes will never be put to the
test of such a severe trial. Come, I will make a
compromise, if you will promise not to say an-
other word about Frank Tierney. I will go
home with you and spend the day, and help to
amuse your son—for which you ought to be very
grateful to me, for, conversationally, he's a trial;
but my going means nothing, understand that.”
Mrs. Sketchley disinterestedly promised all
that was required of her; she was one of those
women who consider that circumstances absolve
them from anything. Thus, though to get the
rich young widow to her house, where May
might see Arthur in the odor of domesticity, she
would declare her readiness to keep and to hold
whatever May demanded, not the less was she
resolved to collect “appearances” for future use
against May Arden, should such a course be de-
manded of her maternal tact.
While the two ladies are on their way to the
Sketchleymansion in GloucesterTerrace, Regent's
Park, we will take a glance over it and its oc-
cupants.
The first thing that came to any one entering
that house was a certain mental and bodily op-
pression; you felt dull, and you couldn't breathe.
Perhaps it was the porter, a stout, sullen man,

with a severely corrective manner, which he ap-
plied to all visitors who did not snub him at
once. Perhaps it was the mingling of damp and
of heat in the atmosphere, which never grew
either brightly cold or generously warm, either
summer or winter. Perhaps some of the melan-
choly at your heart might be due to the ele-
phants’ tusks, and buffaloes’ horns, the lions',
tigers', and black monkey's skins, the chibouques
from Turkey, the bowls from China, the carved
ivory from India, and the mess from everywhere,
arranged in pit-fall and man-trap trophies all
over the entrance-hall, which combined with one
horribly solemn voice to warn you that you had
wandered into the domain of a private collector
of curiosities.
And the truth became more terribly certain
still when you steered clear of the fusty difficul-
ties in the hall and entered the long, handsome
drawing-room. The furniture had been origin-
ally for the use and comfort of the inhabitants of
the house; now it had merged into resting-places
for all the rubbish that the ingenuity of a hare-
brained youth had been able to collect together
and transport to England from every conceivable
and inconceivable corner of the globe. On a
rarely inlaid Indian table would be found a green
fan, a Turkish slipper, the rusty point of a New
Zealander's spear, the heart and intestines of a

Maltese spaniel, preserved in an elegantly-shaped
Greek vase of translucent enamel, and a tooth
from the mouth of the last meal eaten by the
late cannibal king of Dahomey. Beauties and
monstrosities, works of art and works of horror,
were mingled together in tasteless profusion and
vile confusion. The walls were covered with
Wardour Street family portraits, each bearing in
its left hand corner a ticket, written in a clear,
bold, masculine hand, with an imaginary name
and date of death; and these Wardour Street
portraits were grandiloquently spoken of by Cap-
tain Arthur Sketchley as the “forms of his an-
cestors.”
And this mention of his name reminds me that
one other object in the room remains to be des-
cribed.
On a broad, chintz-covered and monkey-skin-
littered couch lay extended the form of a young
man, of about six-and-twenty. His heels, from
being propped up on an ottoman, that in turn
was precariously balanced on the edge of the
couch, occupied such a much higher position in
the world than his head that they claim the first
notice. They were enveloped in Turkish yellow
leather shoes, which latter were declared by
Captain Arthur Sketchley to have been the gift
of the Sultan to him—to do him all justice, when
memory played him false, and he forgot that he

--
had said the Sultan previously, he invariably
insisted on their claim to royal origin, by speak-
ing of them tenderly, as a slight memento of
that good fellow the Pacha's regard for him.
Captain Arthur Sketchley was a little wiry
fellow, with all a sailor's cat-like activity, daring,
and devilment. His long, elf-like, yellow-brown
locks hung round a sea-browned, climate-creased,
weather-reddened face. His long, roughly-chisel-
led nose, and wide, laughing, but thin-lipped
mouth, were indicative of nothing particular.
But the wildly-flashing red-lidded eyes shone
with the fire that his friends said betrayed a
highly excitable organization, and his foes—mad-
ness. However that may be, it had not broken
loose; and now, as he lay there smoking, and
reading, and impatiently awaiting his mother
and the lovely guest she had promised to endea-
vor to secure, he had the satisfaction of knowing
himself to be one of the most rising young officers
in the navy.
But the wild restlessness of an untamed and
untameable nature was there. It showed itself
in the spasmodic, sharp bursts of laughter, in the
cracking “Ha, ha, ha!” he gave when a passage
pleased him. It showed in the rapid change
from one position to another—in the utter ab-
sence of repose in either limb or feature—in the
quick eyes that were round the room with a

lightning flash continually, though nothing was
there, apparently, to call for observation. It
showed in the cruel notice taken of the large,
handsome Skye-terrier, “Revenge,” who was
perpetually called up to have his ears pulled, till
he yelled loudly, and then kicked into obscurity
again. In fact, it showed itself in a variety of
ways that might perchance be pleasing to the
casual observer, but that were decidedly rather
startling to any one condemned to dwell with
him.
And now, having first introduced him, I must
leave him for a time, and go back to Beatrice.
“Why wouldn't you take that dog the man
brought up to us, Frank —such a pretty fellow
he was too—and what is the matter with you?”
Beatrice asked these questions as they stood
together that evening in the drawing-room, while
his mother was indulging in the dangerous, eld-
erly luxury of forty-winks.
Frank's answer was couched in such ambiguous
but depressing terms, that, when he did finally
betake himself to Woolwich, Beatrice soon
pleaded a headache (heartache would have been
more correct), and withdrew to her own bed-
room, where she employed the hours in which
she could not sleep in turning over her dressing-
CaS6.
At last, after some search, she found it.

e
It was a large, dead-gold cross; and Beatrice
fastened it round her throat with a piece of
velvet.
“I’ll wear it from now,” she murmured to
herself; “and then it will not all seem strange
when I quite decide—as I am almost sure I shall
—to be a Sister of Mercy.” -
Poor Beatrice but though May Arden, the
wealthy widow, was laughing, and flirting wildly
with the wild young naval officer, yours was not
the only cross of gold.

CHAPTER XV.
MRS. ARDEN SEES CAPTAIN SRETCHLEY IN THE ODOR
of Dom ESTICITY, AND FINDS IT RATHER AN over-
POWERING ONE.
THE book had been closed with a bang, and
shied accurately into the farthest corner of the
room, to the demolition of a Chinese joss of soap-
stone, which tumbled helpless, broken, and prone
on the floor, despite its sacredness—with a yawn
that proved light literature would have no more
charms for Captain Sketchley this day.
Revenge had been authoritatively commanded
to drop slumber for the nonce, and come up to
be tormented in the endless variety of ways that
occurred to the lighthearted young officer, and
Revenge was just indulging in a prolonged howl
of intense anguish, when Mrs. Sketchley and her
visitor came in.
For the reader's better understanding of the
Sketchley domestic life, I will hint that Mrs.
Sketchley was one of those women who have a
firm faith, i.e., a habit of wildly extolling the
absent.

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 171
call of duty, the last to leave—a thorough sea-
man—a gallant officer—perfectly up, both in the
theory and practice of the profession he loved
with all his heart—Arthur Sketchley, at sea, was
an embodiment of that generally mythical thing,
the right man in the right place.
True that his talk about this thing, that really
and truly was with him a passion, was bombas-
tic, egotistical, and wild. He would begin by
telling you how pluckily the Dido rode through a
storm; and then how gallantly, when dismasted,
she ran before the gale at so many knots an hour.
And about his ship he would rise to a dashing
eloquence that made you forget his elf-like locks
and his powerfully ugly face. But the end of
that weathering the storm was sure to be—the
attention the ambassadress paid him when they
finally got safely into port, and the many times she
waltzed with him at the ball the ambassador gave
in his honor.
Indeed, his love for the navy apart, Captain
Arthur Sketchley was the maddest young snob
that ever existed. And now that he had been
made a commander, at so early an age, his spe-
cial qualities bloomed more luxuriantly than of
yore.
But, for all his arrogant absurdities, for all his
bombastic egotism, for all his unwarrantable as-
Bertions about every human being in a superior

“Bad I ha, ha,” laughed Arthur, executing an
extemporaneous and novel sword dance, and wind-
ing up by leaping over the back of a high oak
chair.
“No, sir; uneasceptionable,” retorted Mrs.
Sketchley, with extreme severity; striving, as she
spoke, to awe the offender into quiescence by her
unfaltering gaze.
“Why didn’t you keep him at home, or make
it pleasanter to him while he was here, eh?”
asked Arthur, waxing wroth in an instant. “Gus
said to me himself, the morning he sailed, “Good-
bye, Arthur, old fellow; you're going home, ain’t
you? Well, I wish you well through Pandemo-
nium.’ He meant home, you know; he did, I
give you my word as an officer in Her Majesty's
service.”
“Wicked, wicked, unfeeling boy!” sobbed Mrs.
Sketchley; “the sacrifices I have made for that
boy! May, my dear, you’d never credit what I
have gone through, for Mr. Sketchley is far,
very far from being all that a man and a father
should be; and then he has the heartless in-
gratitude to turn round upon me and insult me
here in *
“Your own arm-chair,” sang out Arthur, who
had let anger go by for the time. “I love it, I
love it, and who shall dare to chide me for lov-
ing that old arm-chair? Not you, I am per-
suaded, Mrs. Arden.”


## p. 177 (#181) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 175
“Not I–what?” asked May, rather bewild-
ered.
“You will not be the one to chide me for a
feeling that does infinite credit to my heart,
hand, and understanding, as his Royal Highness
the Duke of Cambridge said to me when I made
the assertion to him that such were my senti-
ments on the occasion of his coming on board
the Bellevue, when I had her off Osborne, Her
Majesty's marine residence.”
The mention of the royal appreciator of her
son's virtues soothed Mrs. Sketchley's perturbed
spirit on the spot.
“Dear boy!” she murmured, fondly, “respect-
ed wherever he goes, my dear Mrs. Arden; just
like his brother—as Mr. Graham, whom I may
have mentioned as dear Gus's tutor, has often
said to me: “My dear Mrs. Sketchley, you cannot
be sufficiently thankful for the blessings you en-
joy; in the future I see Gus's career irradiated by
the meteor-like brilliancy of his own genius.’”
“Old chap doesn’t know what a meteor is, I
assure you, Mrs. Arden; he's an impostor, sir, an
impostor. . Gus let a firework off under his nose
once, and on the strength of that, old Graham
presumes to talk about—about a heavenly body
that he's never had anything to do with.”
“Oh, Arthur ! this is very, very distressing to
my feelings,” said Mrs. Sketchley, with the sort

form, and that button, sir, raises emotions in my
heart, to which no language, no, not half-a-dozen
languages, can do justice. I am proud to know
you, Mr. Sketchley;’ and then, Her Majesty—
fine woman she is, with such a spirit—gave me
this rosary that I have in my hand. I’ll give it
to you.”
“I wouldn't take it on any account,” said
May, decidedly; “you ought to keep it in your
family, as a pearl without price, a cherished heir-
loom. I am sure, if a crowned head gave me a
string of old glass beads even, Ishould keep them
and value them—particularly if it was given with
a speech that was so flattering to myself. How
did you come to know her so well ? What is she
like? What did she ride in 7"
“Oh, I hardly know; they’re very enlighten-
ed people, both Otho (that's her husband) and
herself; remarkably handsome woman—a most
remarkably handsome woman—like Gulnare;
you know Gulnare?”
“No ; I do not,” said May Arden, checking
her almost uncontrollable desire to laugh.
“Not know Gulnare l—fine creature Gulnare
—she's the one of whom the immortal bard says,
in ‘Don Juan’”—
“You don’t mean me to take a new view of
the case—do you, Captain Sketchley—and be-
lieve, on your assurance, that Don Juan is to
'e put down as another to Shakspeare #"


## p. 179 (#183) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 179
“Certainly not. Shakspeare was an old muff,
with no immortality worth mentioning, com-
pared to Byron; but, as I was saying, Gulnare
is the one whose beauty is of a kind that will
drive you crazy. No! I’m wrong. It's another
has the maddening style of loveliness. However,
the queen's uncommonly like her. Hullo! here's
- the commodore.”
The gentleman whose advent was thus an-
nounced, was a short, pursy, fat, consequential
man, with a bland bearing, a suave voice, and
the vilest temper that ever was caged in a hu-
man form.
He greeted Mrs. Arden most hospitably, and
informed her that he “was delighted and grati-
fied, and proud to see her,” for he, too, was alive
to the advantages of such a match for his son.
But, for all that it would have been but ave-
ragely diplomatic to have kept a smooth surface
to-night, before the lady yet to be won, they
could not do it. Mrs. Sketchley and her son dis-
puted about the precise hour at which his ap-
pointment to the ship he had commanded had
been delivered at their house—about the relative
importance of the army and navy—about the age
of her uncle, the magistrate—about the social
standing of her brother, the private gentleman.
Finally, Mrs. Sketchley retired in sobs and a
rage to her private sanctum, where May accom-

panied her; and, shortly after, high words were
heard issuing from the room where the father and
son had been left, apparently in peace. The fact
was that the chair of the old banker had been
removed from its former position by his volatile
son, during his momentary absence. The result
was the downfall, both of the master of the house
and the harmony of the evening.
May soon left them after this, and Captain
Sketchley felt persuaded that “by Jove! he'd
made an impression.”

CHAPTER XVI.
“PAPA USED To say—JAY's.”
I HAve said that the last statement that Bea-
trice made in the privacy of her own chamber,
on the night of the day that had witnessed their
encounter with Mrs. Arden, and Frank Tierney's
subsequent dejection, was that she (Beatrice)
would, in all probability, shortly retire from a
participation in the pomps and vanities of this
wicked world, into the unbecoming shades of the
hood of a Sister of Mercy.
But it is a very different thing being resigned
to all the evils that may be in store for one in
this sublunary sphere, when one retires to one's
room at night, tired, cross, and dispirited—it is
a very different thing, making ascetic resolutions
then, and keeping them in the morning, or even
having the wish to keep them in the morning.
I will not go so far as to say that the prospect
from that bedroom window was the brightest in
life, looking, as it did, over the entrances to four
semi-genteel streets, in that South Belgravian
quarter, but it was still bright enough to make

Beatrice determine to wait on fate for a while.
The Micawber spirit is stronger, in most of us, in
fact, than we imagine till we are tried; true, she
sighed as she drew up the blinds, but she also re-
solved to defer that going into black serge and
fever-stricken alleys, professionally, until a later
period—and in the meantime something might
turn up.
She no longer disguised from herself—maid-
enly, proud, womanly reticence no longer called
upon her to disguise it—that she was very truly
and fondly-attached to this Irish cousin of hers,
who had, in the course of their acquaintanceship,
developed into something so un-cousinly and un-
Irish. Nor could he-and a pang of wild joy
made her heart throb, as she thought it—disguise
from her any more that he loved her, even as
she would be loved by Frank Tierney.
What, then, was this cruelly hard chain that
bound him back? Honor and manly faith per-
ceptibly called him on; and yet, though in the
letter he disregarded their appeal, honor and
manly faith were his, undoubtedly, still. His
conduct was an enigma to the woman who loved
him; but she did not, for an instant, descend
into those fatal depths of doubt from whence
love cannot return unsullied.
So she rose in the morning, convinced that
something was wrong somewhere, but, as I said

before, resolved to wait upon fate, and make her
running when the smooth, flat ground, that must
be somewhere, after this lately rough ground
which she had traversed, should be reached.
Mourning was very becoming to Beatrice; it
is to most women who are young and slight, and
who have bright eyes—so, saying that it was so,
is but a small compliment to her. But it was
eacceedingly becoming to her, by reason of the
peculiarity there was in her brunette charms.
There was just that tone about the hue of her
skin that wanted black to whiten it—she looked
remarkably well (for she was a pretty girl) in
colors, but in black she looked distinguished.
Beatrice was in mourning, for the first time
within her experience; and the disagreeable sen-
sations that o'erflowed her mind on discovering
that the new crape-laden dress looked shabby
already, will be sympathized in, as they must
have been shared, by thousands who will reflect
for one instant on the horrible suddenness with
which the four-and-nine-penny-a-yard coburg, or
the more expensive paramatta, “wentrusty” in the
first fortnight of its being worn, and obstinately
refused to look the new and good garment it
was. It is not that they look worn, it is not that
they look brown, it is not that they are scrapped,
or jagged, or ragged; but they persist, after the
first week or two of their early wear, in looking

184 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
poverty-stricken. One knows that, in the reason-
able order of things, they ought to “wear nice
looking” much longer, and that one ought not to
indulge in the luxury of a new ditto yet for a
considerable time. One also feels morally cer-
tain, that if proper patience can be commanded,
that, at the end of a few more weeks, when the
novel shadiness has worn off, they will look as
well as “black in constant wear” ever does look.
But still, for all that, it is a hard thing when
one's bonnet first crinkles, and one's crape skirt
first looks as if it required shearing, not to go to
Jay's at once, and remedy these eyesores.
“I want a new jacket already,” said Beatrice
to herself, as she buttoned the jet knobs that
secured her well-fitting dress round her slight,
beautifully-formed figure, “and while I’m having
that, I may as well have a skirt, with deep tucks
—this looks horrid already l I wonder if Aunt
Tierney will go out shopping with me to-day; it
will help-my goodness! what a poor pass-time,
after all!—to pass the first day of Frank's being
away. He's promised to come up on Sunday,
though, and then a day's to be fixed for our go-
ing to Woolwich, to see his quarters.” And as
she thought of this last projected plan, Beatrice
resolved that she would get a few more trifles,
in the way of gloves, etc.; for she remembered
how fastidious her father had always been as to

THE CROSS OF HONOR. . 185
“how she looked”—how particular that she
should have the best of everything, and how flat-
teringly interested in what suited the pretty
daughter, who thus learnt to love dress, as many
women do, for the sake of those who love to see
them in what is dainty, fair, and bright.
And, as she thought of her father, poor, for-
lorn Beatrice forgot her dress, and cried with a
more hearty grief for him, maybe, than would a
model girl, who would have set to, and learnt
lessons of economy and prudence, even in her
first sorrow.
The breakfast that morning was very lonely,
Beatrice was not fond of making early morning
calls upon people who remained in bed in a
motiveless manner: therefore she simply sent
her love to her aunt, and hoped she was well;
and her aunt returned her love by Norah—with
a request appended, that Beatrice would forth-
with send her up a poached egg, a rasher of
streaky bacon, and a very strong cup of coffee,
which “the misthress cud just pick, she thart,”
Norah said; but as in the course of Beatrice's
unsatisfactory meal the daughter of Erin made
several raids amongst the viands, Beatrice con-
cluded that the appetite of her aunt had been
underrated by that suggestion.
Mrs. Tierney was not ill pleased at the notion
of a shopping expedition. Castle Tierney had

been far removed from the possibility of indulg-
ing in anything so paradisiacal. She wanted a
few more things for herself and Norah—she
wanted a few more things to send as kind me-
mentos to some Tierney hangers-on in Ireland;
and, above all, she wanted to partake in that
ecstatic feeling produced in women by the sight
of all manner of luxurious articles, in luxurious
profusion around them. For a rich girl, Mrs.
Tierney would have been a most able coadjutor;
for a poor girl, she was rather a dangerous one.
“Now, where shall we go, auntº asked Bea-
trice, brightly, as soon as they got outside their
own door. “We ought to have some idea; don’t
you think so f”
“Oh! where you like,” replied Mrs. Tierney,
genially. “There's shops on all sides; it is not
far we need go, to be suited with all we are
wanting.”
“Papa used to say Jay's,” suggested Beatrice,
doubtfully looking up into the now beaming face
of her aunt. “Do you think we could find that,
Aunt Tierney?”
Mrs. Tierney looked equal to finding anything,
as far as standing any extraneous amount of wear
and tear was concerned. Her long, handsomely-
trimmed black cloak was constrained to attach
itself together, and to her person, in a way so
well-made a garment had surely never been re-

quired to do before. Her bonnet was all a-one
side; and the bow, into which the strings had
been dovetailed, was rapidly subsiding into that
knot, so very hard to untie by fair means, known
disrespectfully as a “Granny’s.”
“Papa used to say Jay's,” Beatrice said, in .
the hesitating accents a person of large faith, but
timid practice, might employ, if suggesting a
tour in fairyland to a stern realist.
“It depends a great deal, I’m thinking, on
what you want, Beatrice,” said Mrs. Tierney;
and at this brilliant reminder, they were both
thrown back into the realms of doubt as to their
destination again.
“Well,” said Beatrice, after a pause, during
which they wandered further from the parts
where omnibuses plied, and into regions yet
more remote from a cabstand, “I want boots—
pretty boots, and dresses, and gloves, and a
shawl, and, oh! several things.”
“We don’t seem likely to find them here,”
remarked Mrs. Tierney, dolefully; “nor the
things I’m wanting either. I’ve pickles to get
and preserves, and an orange-tree in bloom, and
fruit, too, to send over to the christening of
Michel Maurice's fourth son. You have heard
Frank speak of Michel Maurice?”
She was the unprotected female, adrift in the
world no longer; she was the lynx-eyed mother

glancing keenly into all that concerned her son.
Beatrice felt the sudden, inexplicable exaltation
that came over her aunt as she asked that ques-
tion, and she could have smote the tell-tale
cheek that burned with a passionate bloom as
she answered—
“No, never, aunt; who is he?”
“The father of a girl that wanted to marry
Frank once, only I put my veto upon anything
of the sort.”
“Indeed!” and now Beatrice could hardly re-
press a sneer; “and did Frank prove obedient?
It must have been very unexpected if he did,
I should think, against the dictates of his own
heart.”
“The dictates of his own heart had nothing
whatever to do in the matter,” replied Mrs.
Tierney, rather coldly ; and now that Beatrice's
judgment was not biassed by her being kind,
she could see how very untidy her aunt was. “I
did not say that Frank wanted to marry her; I
simply put my veto upon the girl's making a
goose of herself. At that time Frank wanted to
marry some one else.”
Beatrice's attention was aroused and enchained,
with a vengeance; but she could not have asked
a question, had her life depended on it. She
could walk along and keep down the wild sor-
row that was battling for utterance, and that was

all. It is not a pleasant thing, that, hearing for
the first time, that the one you want to marry
yourself has at any period of his or her career
wanted to marry somebody else.
“Has he ever told you about her ?” asked her
aunt, presently.”
“No, never,” said Beatrice.
“Then we'll drop the subject,” said Mrs.
Tierney; and, on the whole, I must say I think
it was rather a meat way of getting out of her
difficulty. She was much too proud a mother—
much too exacting a woman—to go on and ex-
pose how very little she knew about the subject
herself. - -
“Hadn't we better get into a cab, and say
where we want to go?” said Beatrice at last; for
her knees were trembling with retrospective
jealousy.
So they found a cab, and got in, and said where
they wanted to go, or rather didn’t say where they
wanted to go, with the clear emphasis required by
a London cabman.
So, after going to a boot-shop in the City,
and an Italian warehouse in the West-end, they
finally found themselves deposited at the door
of the great emporium of ready-made woe in
Regent-street, and subjected to the modest charge
of eighteen shillings for the locomotive bliss they
had enjoyed.

190 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
“But isn't it rather dear?” Beatrice asked,
modestly, as she tendered the amount. “We
might have hired a carriage for it.”
“And so you hev hired a carriage.” The cab-
man had been weighing the respective merits of
bullying and fawning; he decided in favor of the
former, for the “old 'un looked careless-like,”
he thought, and “the young 'un down on her
luck.” “And so you hev hired a carriage, which
sixpence a mile is the charge, and we’ve been
miles more nor I'd like to count, to say nothin'
of waitin' at half the shops in London.”
“For all that, I don’t mean to be cheated,”
said Beatrice.
If the cabman had been deprecating in his
manner, so would Beatrice have been; but, as he
attempted to put her down, and extort through
brutality, her natural spirit came to her aid
through the clouds of gloom that encompassed
her, and defeated him.
“I shall go into that shop,” she continued,
“and ask some one to be kind enough to come
out and pay you what is due to you, after I have
told where we have been.”
And so she did; and the cabman had to ac-
cept his defeat, and less than half his charge.
Even this little excitement of going about in a
fusty cab, and winding up with a quarrel with
the cabman, wrought a good effect—that is to

say, good shot with bad, as they say of a change-
able, silk. It made her look pretty, and feel
lighter-hearted; and, as a natural consequence,
it inclined her to greater expenditure. The lady
who saves twopence or two shillings on her cab
or omnibus, is sure to walk into a shop with the
pleasing conviction firmly impressed upon her
mind that through having effected that saving
she is fully justified in spending two pounds
more than she had intended on the contem-
plated dress. 4.
Papa's taste had been unexceptionable, and
papa had always said Jay’s. Beatrice had a very
accurate eye, and no sooner selected a dress than
the trimmings and accompaniments that were
proper became absolutely necessary to her. And
then she pointed out a black-and-white morning
wrapper, that would be the very thing to wear
to save her crape skirts in the mornings; and
then she chose a crape and tulle fichu; and then
sundry pairs of gloves, with divers kinds of
gauntlets attached thereunto; and then—but it
is unfair to specify the various extravagances
into which a young lady, at large in a seductive
London shop, rushed—suffice it to say, that a
refusal to submit to an extortionate demand for
the fare, on their return home, would have been,
with both ladies, a matter no longer of choice,
but of necessity.

The rest of that day passed agreeably enough;
there was the thought that it was Friday, and
that on Sunday Frank would be there again;
there was the late dinner, which was not much
more unpleasant to the eye and taste than din-
ners, whether late or early, with which people
are regaled in “furnished, with cooking and at-
tendance,” apartments generally are; and, lastly,
there was the parcel from Jay's]
“Dear me!” said Beatrice, when she had un-
packed, and looked at ev'rything, and found out
—as one invariably does when out of the influ-
ence of the shop in which they'were bought—
that these things were not so essential to her well-
being as she had imagined—“dear me! I didn't
want half these things, after all; and now I
haven't any money left.”
“When do you expect to get any more, my
dear?” asked her aunt.
It just occurred to her that, perhaps, Beatrice,
through some mistaken chivalry of Frank's, might
be still unconscious of “how she was left.”
“I am sure I can’t tell,” began Beatrice, ear-
nestly, and with the first momentary cloud that
had ever dimmed it crossing her brow; “there's
something to come to me, I suppose. Poor papa's
pay, you know, for the quarter; and the money
the things made; and ’’
She stopped short, with the damping, crushing

conviction that she had enumerated all her re-
Sources.
“Oh ! Aunt Tierney,” she said, presently ris-
ing up and going over to the woman, who, for
all her outward composure, was sorely put to it,
how best, most kindly, to let the poor child know
the hard truth—“Oh! Aunt Tierney, tell me at
once—what I ought to have asked before—the
little I have will be as nothing for me!” *
“Nothing, if you had to live upon it, dar-
ling.”
Mrs. Tierney at that moment would have
pawned the Castle for “the child,” if any one
would have advanced on it “but useful pocket-
money, for a time, for my adopted daughter.”
“Thank you, aunt,” said Beatrice, quietly.
“And now I'll go and put these things away.”
“I don’t half like the way she takes it,” so-
liloquized Mrs. Tierney, when Beatrice had left
the room. “And Frank won’t half like her
knowing anything about it; but, still, it was
time the child did, or she'd have been going all
over London—wherever “Papa (poor Maurice!)
had always said.’”
“This shall not go on any longer,” was Bea-
trice's last waking thought. “I can’t afford to
live here and see Frank; and I can’t afford to go
off, and be porfessionally charitable and de-
spondent. I won't be a governess. So I must

look out for what papa used to call a poodle-
washer's berth.”
And the resolution, made this night, was not
put a-one side, to wait on fate in the morning.
She was more determined to wear the Cross of
Honor than she had been to wear the Cross of
Gold.
Now, at the first blush of the thing, it is much
more courageous to decide on being a companion,
than it is to decide on being a Sister of Mercy;
for, in the former case, the act of self-abnegation
is such a common and everyday occurrence, that
no one exalts the perpetrator of it into a heroine.
But, in the latter case, there is a melancholy,
pious gloom, and, in the garb, an uncompromis-
ingly devotional ugliness, that wins for the one
about to sacrifice herself an amount of curious
pity and admiring attention that is refreshing
while it lasts, but that has the slight drawback
—to be sure of lasting a very short time.

CHAPTER XVII.
MRs. ARDEN ON THE PIANo, AND CAPTAIN SKETCHLEY
ON THE BONES-OF HIS ANCESTORS.
TIME rarely hung heavy on Captain Sketch-
ley's hands when he was located in London.
Independently of quarrelling with his father and
mother, he had many occupations of a congenial
nature. He liked going to the Admiralty, and
harassing, if not the First Lord, at least his secre-
tary; he liked picking up any stray naval man
in town, and receiving flattery from him if he
were poor and desolate—friendship if he were
rich and respected. He liked attending the
levees, and getting his cocked hat spoilt, and his
eyes injured, by the awkwardness and swords of
those who were less proficient then himself. He
liked seeing his name in full in the morning
papers of the following day, “Captain Arthur
Hamilton Sketchley, by his Grace the Duke of
Nottingham.” He liked strutting along outside
the rails of Rotten Row, and making believe, to
any likely-to-be-gulled bystander, that he was
personally acquainted with every noble lady
who passed.

It was a bewildering thing to those who knew
him well—it will ever remain one of the most
awful of unexplained phenomena—how this per-
fect, thorough officer could be so little of a gentle-
7700170,
In the proudest service in the world, he was
acknowledged to be the one—by men who were
glad for the reflected honor it would bring them
to serve with, and under him. But on shore,
like a swan or a duck, or a royal yachtsman,
or any other unmitigated aquatic, he lost im-
measurably.
In addition to this, he could always play bil-
liards with the casual acquaintance made over
the champagne, with which he was wont to glad-
den his heart from morning to night, at short
and irregular intervals; and when he could do
none of these things any longer, he could buy
gloves at Pivers', and perfume in the Burlington
Arcade.
But this morning a nobler ambition fired his
brain. He would go and deepen that impression
he had made on the fair widow. Like the Laird
of Cockpen, he went forth in all his bravery.
On his finger glittered a ring, which he was pre-
pared to swear had been the gift to him, under
circumstances of peculiar and affecting interest,
of an African chief, whose heart had first warmed
to him from witnessing the heroic fortitude with

which he, on a never-to-be-forgotten occasion,
partook of the liver of a deceased messmate.
In his hand he carried a cane, delicate, natty,
with half-a-dozen initials wrought into the most
illegible of monograms, on the silver plate at the
top. This cane had been wont to adorn the hand
—he would assure his friends—of a man whom
to know was an honor, and to be intimate with
was a boon—a man whom he was proud to call
his “dear and valued old friend, Charlie Napier.”
It was a gratifying feature in the case to notice
how—on occasions of coming in contact with his
esteemed friend—completely he abstained from
either inviting or receiving notice from the great
In all.
He did not say, in the words of the aforesaid
laird to whom I have likened him, that she'd be
daft to refuse him; but, nevertheless, he thought
it.
“It isn't every woman,” he said to himself, as
he swaggered along Piccadilly, “that has the
opportunity, sir, of sharing the name and position
of a man with such ancestral and professional
claims as mine.”
Captain Sketchley's belief in his ancestors was
another of those touching traits in his character
that suggested Bedlam. Nobody else extant,
contemporaneously with himself, had ever heard
of them. Very few of those who had been extant,

198 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
contemporaneously with themselves, had ever
heard of them. Yet, his firm faith in the legends
he had coined respecting them was a grand thing
in its way. Not a battle renowned in English
history but had seen a Sketchley in the brunt of
it, cleaving the head of some unfortunate but
equally mythical personage, according to the
revised and improved version of the affair by this
latest scion of the stock.
The “blood of the Sketchleys” was a fluid to
which such frequent allusion was made in the
most casual conversations. Captain Arthur of that
ilk ever held with other humanity, that this lat-
ter generally ended by wishing that every drop
of it had been spilt in some one of the alluded-to
fights, so that none had been able to flow down to
color the statements of this “last and worst of
his race,” in whose veins it boiled and seethed
with mad violence.
Mrs. Arden was tired of everything, for the
simple reason that the one thing in the world
that she had set her warm little heart on attain-
ing, seemed not, and was not, within her reach.
At seven-and-twenty, women who are wealthy,
and who have a fair and unimpeached name and
fame before the world, the taste to enjoy cul-
tivated society, and the things that conduce
towards the cultivation and refinement of that
society, together with the means of procuring

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 199
and commanding it and them—at seven-and-
twenty, women who can do, and who are all
this, rarely feel that all is an utter blank before
them.
In very early life Mrs. Arden had known as
much sorrow as usually falls to the lot of woman.
A beauty, an heiress, and an only child—she had
been allowed to follow her own sweet will; and
her own sweet will led her to form a matrimonial
alliance with one of the most specious, heartless,
licentious scoundrels who ever made a third-rate
tricky genius his excuse for perpetrating every
description of wild folly that could alienate a
woman's heart, and wring a woman’s soul with
shame for that she ever could have loved him.
She bore it all, until a tide of loathing set in,
that swept her along its current with mad force
to the sea of separation; slight, fragile, delicate
lily that she was, she bore from him, with un-
yielding feminine dignity, for a time, insults and
indignities that would have bowed the head and
broken the heart of a stronger woman. But, at
last, she could bear it no longer; she made—for
her future peace—the fatal mistake of leaving
him, and appealing for protection to that court
from which it seems impossible for a woman to
come out untainted. She gained her cause—she
got her divorce; but she shuddered, at the time,
at the horrible obnoxious penny-a-lining publicity


## p. 200 (#204) ############################################

200 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
that was hers; she shuddered at the private life
(though hers was, beyond all doubt, blameless)
being laid bare, and commented upon by all who
had ever known her, and thousands who had not;
she trembled and wept over the severance of
every tie, once holy, now irksome; but she shud-
dered, and trembled, and wept yet more when
her heart was cruelly punished for the evils it
had been unable to bear.
She was sitting alone in her comfortable little
boudoir, when Captain Sketchley was ushered into
her presence. It was a tiny room, by compari-
son with the drawing-room from which it opened;
but, what it lacked in size, it made up in quality.
She always hired “furnished apartments;” but
she invariably carried her boudoir about with
her, and merely required a frame, i.e., four walls
within which to place it when located in a fresh
abode.
The walls of Mrs. Arden's boudoir were draped
with Rose du Barri corded silk. They were not
fluted—that, she had discovered, was a mistake in
walls that were to bear paintings: the silk was
arranged in flat plaits, after the manner of the
chintz hangings on board the royal yachts. In
the centre of the room was a floral pyramid—
evergreens at the bottom—roses (crimson and
white) on the next round—ferns drooping over
from the third tier, to temper this vivid coloring

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 201
—the rich blue lobelin, mingled with lilies of the
valley, on the fourth; and on the fifth and high-
est, feathery ferns again, surrounding one glow-
ing crimson rose.
This floral structure was modern—the only
modern thing in the room; or, at least, the only
palpably modern thing, for the couch on which
Mrs. Arden sat was much younger than it affected
to be.
The two cabinets, the writing and work tables,
the little piano, the casket containing letters, the
vases, and clock on the mantelpiece—all these
were unmistakably antiques. They were one and
all of enamel and Sèvres china; the ground of
that peculiar, and not to be reproduced Rose du
Barriblue: the subjects, beauties of Louis XIV.'s
time, in court, fancy, and other dresses.
And the appearance of the mistress and occu-
pant of this room was harmonious. Nothing
jarred; face, figure, costume—all was as fair as
even Rose du Barri surroundings required.
From the purple-velvet-slippered feet, to the
delicate collar of embroidery that finished off the
bright fawn-colored silk robe, all was correct and
in keeping.
Captain Sketchley recognised, the moment he
entered, that that crowding together of things
that marked arrangements in his mother's house,
was a mistake.

No man can give that gaze which is not a stare
of surprise, nor a stare of annoyance, nor (es-
pecially this latter) a stare of ill-breeding, but a
double distilled essence and combination of the
two former, with the effect a woman can. And
this was the gaze that was directed full at Captain
Sketchley as he entered, and stood gesticulating,
hat and pocket-handkerchief in hand (all vulgar
men trust largely to their pocket-handkerchiefs
in moments of social peril), before Mrs. Arden.
She rose, for she was always a graceful hostess,
and gave him her hand—her little cold steady
hand—for an instant, and then motioned him to
a chair at some distance from her couch, and
then sat down and spoke of the weather, observ-
ing that it was very disagreeable, it being too
windy to take Floss out for an airing—and alto-
gether iced Captain Sketchley, and made him
marvel why he, an officer in her Majesty's Navy,
had come here to be treated thus.
When a lady leans back, and calmly surveys
the human interruption that has occurred to the
midst of that page of the novel she is reading, on
which she keeps her finger—the situation for that
aforesaid interruption becomes one of depressing,
anguish usually, if he chances not to be pos-
sessed of sufficient moral courage to rise up, and
stand, not upon the manner of his going, but go
at once. Arthur Sketchley could not do it; for

once in his life, he was fairly at fault, and he
could not determine whether he was so through
the agency of the blue china or the lady. But
by degrees his courage came up again; he might
gain a good deal by staying, he still thought—so
he rushed into the middle of some of his expe-
riences, and amused her into being more affable
to him. Then he rapturously praised her dog,
and her room—specially her china—and wound
up by asking her to play him something.
Mrs. Arden played well; and she had fatigued
herself with listening and laughing at his bursts
of nonsense—two reasons why she should accede
to his request, since she saw no probability of his
taking his departure. So she sang him a version
of the Enchanted Palace and Sleeping Beauty
story, in which Tennyson's glorious words were
displaced, and spoiled, of course, but of which
the air was ringingly bright.
“Bah!” she exclaimed, rising abruptly when
she had struck the last bar; “‘the happy Prince,
with joyful eyes,' only comes to the one who
waits for him—in song.”
Captain Sketchley “could not agree with her.”
“But I know it,” she continued; “or, at the
most, he rides by, and dares not the fate of those
whose bodies and bones warn him that, in days
gone by, breaking through the hedge was not
alone a difficulty, but a danger.”
Captain Sketchley “could assure her that there

were men—he could at least solemnly assure her
that there was, at least, a man—ready to adven-
ture upon the experiment, without the slightest
regard for the ghastly warning.”
“Then he's sure not to be the Prince,” she
said, laughing again;–“by-the-bye, don't you
think it was very unfeeling of the happy pair, to
ride off without giving a thought to the decent
burial of the unsuccessful ones?”
“Very !” Captain Sketchley thought—“very
unfeeling indeed; vanquished rivals should be
treated with common decency, whether in allegory
or in the flesh; for his own part, to take the
matter-of-fact and practical view of the case, he
had a very profound respect for the ashes of the
departed; it had been his naturally—it had been
nourished on classic soil. To-day, in coming
through Regent-street, he had seen a vase of the
burial urn order, which he had immediately re-
solved to make his own. The thought that the
bones of his ancestors were lying on numerous
fields of valor, which they had won, was painful
to him. The spot where a Sketchley had fallen
was sure to be remarkable; forthwith he would
collect them, have them cleaned, and put them
into this vase. Didn't Mrs. Arden think it would
be a good idea—capital plan—the only recom-
pense, in fact, that a fellow could make his an-
cestors for the honor they were to him f*
At this point, Mrs. Arden interrupted the rapid

flow of language with a quiet little remark. She
had a very low, gentle voice, and she spoke very
quietly always; therefore she was sure of com-
manding her audience. It is only women who
shriek forth their sentiments who experience a
difficulty in making themselves heard. The low-
toned ones of the earth are always listened to.
“Has it ever occurred to you, Captain Sketch-
ley, that your nonsense, though very amusing to
yourself, is very tedious and unentertaining to
other people *
“Never!—'pon my honor, Mrs. Arden, you
mean to insult me, madam—a Sketchley does not
stand this sort of thing, by Jovel—I am afraid
you don’t appreciate” (he called it appreeciate)
“that peculiar power of recital for which I am
so eminently famed.”
Captain Sketchley had risen with wrath in his
bearing; but his moods being transient, all of
them, he had wound up his remonstrance with a
merry laugh at the idea of any one failing to ap-
preciate him.
“Perhaps I do not: that's my misfortune; but
I, at any rate, will tell you, that you are rather a
strain on one's patience when you give those
powers full play. I, for instance, can very sel-
dom laugh with you, and to keep on laughing at
you is fatiguing.”
It was not kind of Mrs. Arden to say it; but

she was getting cross, and he made no sign of
going.
Captain Sketchley evidently found this first
plainly-given lesson on his faults and foibles a
severe one. He could not realize it at all. Mrs.
Arden, only a woman, snub him / He drew a
long—a savagely long—breath ; and then he
thought he saw it all—she wanted to lead him

“Mrs. Arden,” he began, with a pompous
solemnity—“Mrs. Arden, you are justified in
being rather impatient of the rhodomontade style
of conversation in which I have indulged—keep-
ing you in a state of suspense was unpardonable,
after I had given you such confident reason to
expect something different. A princess—an Af.
rican princess—of the purest water (Imean blood)
has been offered me, by her royal parent, ma'am,
in matrimony. Lovely creatures in every clime
have sighed—and sighed, I hasten to observe, in
vain—for the honor I am about to confer upon
you. Mrs. Arden, will you be my wife?”
“Thank you, no l’” said Mrs. Arden.
“Do you know what you are refusing, madam?
The hand of an officer in Her Majesty's Navy is
not to be picked up every day, let me tell you.
I am entitled to present you at court, madam, if
I make you my wife—to carry a sword”—
“I must decline the hand, in spite of its sword.

carrying and bone collecting qualities, Captain
Sketchley. I must be explicit with you, I find,
since you have opened the forbidden subject
again. If I told you that I wouldn't marry you
if there wasn't another man in the world, you
might doubt me, perhaps; but when I tell you
that while there is another I will not, you may
believe me.”
“You will repent these—these insults /?” said
Captain Sketchley, his face livid with rage, and
his eyes darting forth lurid lightning; really,
now that he felt he must lose her, he loved her
with something like genuine affection. “No,
madam, I will not offer my hand in friendship;
for, as sure as my name is Arthur Hamilton
Sketchley, you will repent of these insults.”
“Oh I no I shall not,” she said, carelessly.
(but she did, in time to come). “Good morn-
ing.” And so they parted.

CHAPTER XVIII.
A FRIEND IN N E E D.
HUNDREDs of thousands have searched the ad-
vertisement columns of the Times to find the
thing that will suit them—or “anything, any-
thing”—with beating hearts, and throbbing tem-
ples, and anxious, fluttering hands; but no one
ever searched it with more beating, throbbing,
and fluttering than did Beatrice Constable.
The craving had come upon her to “do some-
thing” for herself; to rid herself of the horrible
feeling this life of dependence gave; to get out
of the house of bondage and slavery (for such the
house of her aunt would be to her now) as rapidly
as possible. It is a very unpleasant and humiliat-
ing thing to awaken to the knowledge that you
are beholden for all you have, when you have
thought that the favors were equally divided
between yourself and another. Beatrice went
through sensations that nearly choked her, that
first morning after the visit to Jay's; she practised
such small and futile economy as occurred to her
distorted mind. She left off sugar to her tea, and
didn't butter her bread; but the unsweetened tea


## p. 209 (#213) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 209
and dry bread would be paid for out of funds to
which she would have no power to contribute.
Therefore was Beatrice wholly miserable, and
utterly unable to think that poverty was the
most blissful state in the world.
It is one of the received and steadily believed-
in axioms afloat in the world, that adversity and
poverty bring out the noble traits of a character
that has any noble traits to be brought out.) But
Ido not believe it.) Generosity I have been taught
to consider noble; and with sixpence in the hand
and nothing in the bush, to indulge in generosity
becomes a crime. That comparative poverty
which precludes the possibility of going to the
opera three times a week, and of entertaining
one's friend at the most recherché of dinners d-la-
Russe on the remaining three—which limits one
to a brougham and one riding-horse, to a buttons
instead of a Jeames, to a villa in Kensington
instead of a mansion in Park-lane or Piccadilly,
may be a poverty to refine and purify the too
worldly human heart. But that the poverty which
perpetually reminds one that it is well to look
before the leap, which may be very good in itself,
is taken; which teaches one to turn, at the dic-
tates of prudence, from the sight of the bare-
footed beggar, old, worn, and weary; which
makes one deaf to the cry of the widow, and
cold to the wail of the orphan; which makes one

hold the hand that might save the weak from
folly and the erring from crime; which makes
L. S. D. the idol to which one must bow if one
would not die beaten by the way—that this is a
poverty that can aid in developing nobility of cha-
racter I am not so false to the teachings of expe-
rience as to believe. It makes the eye too watch-
ful, and the tongue too wary; the rough hewing
that it renders necessary hardens alike the heart
and the hand; nor does it, I fear, make the un-
derstanding more ductile and impressionable. It
cannot crush passion and pathos out of the soul
and brain utterly; but both, perchance, would
be exhibited in a more pleasing garb if they had
not been made to graduate in the stern school of
adversity.
Probably some such ideas gleamed across Bea-
trice Constable's mind, as she sat there nibbling
the dry bread and the hard truth, and possibly
some far more desolate and less reasonable ones
did also. She was, undoubtedly, very unhappy;
the change from what had been to what was
pained and hurt the girl to a degree she would
not have believed, had she been told six months
before that a reverse of fortune could have
done.
It would be hard to go out in the world and
hold her own against the dwellers in high places
thereof, with whom she might be constrained to

take service; but that would be better, anything
would be better than owing aught to Frank—to
whom still, with a woman's inconsistency, she
gladly owed all.
That dreary advertisement-sheet! How many
pangs has the framing of one single paragraph
cost, perhaps.
The most pathetically worded are not the
most replete with true pathos, I am inclined to
believe; it is the plainly phrased direct appeal
that always touches me most nearly.
The list of those who “wanted situations” was
long; the list of those who required occupants
for said situations was short. Beatrice sickened
as she read, and put the paper down with a sigh
as the conviction deepened in her mind that
huge difficulties would have to be surmounted,
even in the unpleasant path which duty, and
honor, and pride constrained her to take.
“What am I fit for * she cried aloud, with an
impatient stamp of the pretty little foot that had
during her, father's life trodden only in the
pleasant ways of the world. “I’m not even fit for
a cook, since it would be my humble ambition to
be a good one,” she continued, with a half laugh.
“And as to being a governess, if I had indulged
in any such lofty aspirations they would all have
been crushed out of me by this morning's read-
ing. And people who want companions insist

that they shall make themselves ‘generally use-
ful,” which I am sure I couldn’t do. Well, I
must wait now till Monday, and be as happy as
I can to-morrow, for Frank will be here.”
It is an easy thing to say, in calm tones, that
one will wait patiently for a given period; but
it is almost impossible to do it unless the blood
is cold as a fish's, and sluggish in flowing. Wait-
ing, with the heart beating, and the pulse throb-
bing with the wild fever of impatience, is worse
to endure, harder to bear, than the most cruel
actual end can be which touches oneself alone.
She had thought to put anxiety for the future
away for a time, and to enjoy the beautiful pre-
sent which Frank's being there would make;
but she could not. In action alone she found
peace, in apparently taking some steps forward
in the direction of the end that must come. She
marshalled in mental review the names of all
those who would be likely to be able to assist
her; and when she had thought them all over,
she decided on applying to no one but Herbert
Challoner.
“So kind, so true, so nobly just and trusting
to Frank he is,” she thought. “I’ll write and
tell him everything, and ask for his advice.”
And so she did : and when the letter was
despatched—when she had taken her first reso-
lute step forward—she felt happier, and better

able to greet her aunt with the bright cheerful-
ness of the Beatrice of old.
He could hardly tell her—he could hardly
bear to tell her—what he knew would rob her
cheek of the blush that brightened it to all its
former loveliness, and her eyes of the soft light
that lived in them, with a flattering radiance for
the man who called it into existence; he would
keep the news back for a time, and let Beatrice
trick herself in the beams of happiness while she
might. But even as he stood resolving upon
this, marking her womanly grace and charms as
she came forward to give him the cordial wel-
come a cousin might give, Beatrice looked into
Frank Tierney's face, and read there that some-
thing more “dreadful” had to be told and
listened to.
“What is it, Frank?” she asked, with a pas-
sionate keenness of tutterance. “You have
something to tell me that will hurt me, I know;
but tell it quickly.”
“My regiment is ordered off to the Crimea at
once,” he said, abruptly walking to the window
as he spoke. “I have been expecting it, but not
so soon. We sail on Tuesday.”
When he turned from the window, Beatrice
was there no longer.
“Be careful, Frank,” said his mother, coming
forward, and placing her hand on his shoulder.

“You should remember that there was much
sorrow—much biting poverty, privation, and
care—that there were many devices resorted to,
unworthy of the name, in your father's time, at
Castle Tierney.”
“I know it,” he replied, moodily.
“And do you know how they were brought
about?” she asked, throwing her head back with
a haughty gesture. -
“I do, mother.”
“ How 2°
“By an assiduously cultivated, falsely senti-
mental desire to hold to traditions that never
should have been handed down, and family traits
that never existed; by the mistakenly fond fos-
tering of characteristics that in time lost all of
dashing fascination they had ever possessed, and
became mere unchecked extravagances; by a
series of follies, mother, that are better for-
gotten, since they are past, and cannot be re-
called.”
He spoke very gravely and gently; but Mrs.
Tierney’s tones were hot and passionate, as she
replied— -
“By nothing of the sort, boy; they were
brought about by this face,” and she swept her
hand across her brow as she spoke, “which in
its youth was far fairer even than your cousin's.
Your father forgot what he owed to his race, and

married for beauty alone, when he should—as he
could—have combind it with wealth. The result
was the cark and care, the poverty and penury,
which it nearly broke my heart to witness, since
I was the cause. I never forgot the sacrifices he
had made, nor will I let my son forget them.
You must not err as he did.”
“Decidedly I shall not, mother.”
“Frank, you had it in your power to regene-
rate your father's name. Why, why will you
let a falsely honorable scruple stand in your
way?”
“That subject must not be mentioned.”
“Nor shall it again, Frank—nor shall it
again; but now that you are going away, and
that your heart will be surely wrung by the
sight of her distress (I love her, too, for she's
my brother's daughter), I must caution you to
be careful, for Beatrice Constable has a rare
charm.”
And then seeing an ominous cloud lower over
her son's brow, and Beatrice re-entering the
room, Mrs. Tierney dropped the subject, and
they talked about affairs in the Crimea, spoke
with cheery tones of his prospects of promotion,
and thought (two of them at least), with sad
hearts, of his prospects of death.
It was not heartless of her? No; I do not
think that the tenderest, on consideration, will

accuse her of being heartless in this thing; but
it had come to such a pass with Beatrice, that
she was glad—yes, after the first pang of wonder
and sorrow was over, she was glad that march-
ing orders had come to Frank, though perchance,
they might have come to march him to his
death.
Something better than this horrible stagnation
of all things must eventuate through this sudden
breaking up and severance of the ties and habits
of the last few weeks.
He could not, she thought—arguing as women
fatally will, from their own feelings—he could
not leave her with the passionate longing he had
raised at her heart still unsatisfied, when he was
going forth where danger and death would be
around and assailing him. The something that
held him from her must give way now, if mortal
love was strong enough to break its unseen links
—if the present, in its solemn sadness, was as
holy to him as to her, it must sanctify the past,
whatever that past had been—if the future
seemed as serious, as fraught with noble dangers,
as full of opportunities of displaying that gal-
lantry and bravery which a woman loves to be-
lieve, are the attributes plenteously of her hero—
if it seemed all this, then would he joy to claim
the constant thoughts of one heart that could
beat highly in unison with his own. In short,

to be practical, Beatrice believed it to be impos-
sible that Frank could leave her without the
word that should end her heart's suspense, on
such an errand as he was bent on.
She was agitated—excited to an extraordinary
degree, and her agitation and excitement roused
every particle of her lately slumbering beauty
into new life and force. She reminded him of
how she had looked that first evening of his see-
ing her, when her father had brought her proudly
before his notice. His voice and eyes were well
under command usually, but not even Frank
Tierney could steady the former to coolness and
the latter to ordinary admiration, as she sat
there, essaying to busy herself about some tea-
table arrangements, and failing in everything
save the one grand thing of being charming, and
winning love.
How would it end? He wondered how ! as he
marked the cheek kindling to get a quicker, pas-
sionate, glowing warmth, under the gaze he could
not render aught but what it was—tender and
fond.
She wondered how! but feared not; so loving
her, he could but tell her so before he went away;
so loved by her, he would escape all dangers,
and return when this terrible war was over, un-
scathed, unharmed, unchanged.
Mrs. Tierney wondered how ! as she thought

of the dilapidated castle, and microscopic rent-
roll—of the delicate dimensions of a captain's
pay, and the elegant tastes of the two who were
making her think anxiously of these things.
As the evening wore on, Beatrice began to
taste that terrible agony a gambler feels when he
has cast his all on the hazard of a die. The time
was so short now ; it would be all a blank to her
if the next half hour did not hear those words
uttered, for the utterance of which she had im-
patiently prayed this last half hour to come.
At last she could bear it no longer.
“I will leave you with your mother,” she said,
with startling abruptness. “I am going into the
drawing-room, Frank, for you will like to be
alone with your mother.”
And before either of them could protest—Mrs.
Tierney out of fear that Frank would seek her
there, and Frank out of conventional politeness
—Beatrice had passed from the room, and up-
stairs into the apartment where she had, but the
other day, in a slight rebound from sorrow, laid
out and designed a corner comprising comfort
for herself and happiness for Frank.
He was coming; she heard the dining-room
door open, and his footstep on the stair. Would
he ask her to marry him at once? Officers' wives
were allowed to go with their husbands in war
time, and she would be ready to do even as Lady

Errol—brave, beautiful, Lady Errol was doing
already—live under canvas, and in constant
danger and discomfort. Would he tell her why
he had hesitated before ? Would his mother
make a dreadful piece of work, or sensibly sub-
mit to what could not be avoided any more ?
Would Frank accuse her, in his most secret
heart, of having come up here on purpose to
secure an uninterrupted interview with him ;
She asked herself all these questions—she an-
swered them all to her own complete satisfaction
in the interval between Frank's step first sound-
ing on the stair and Frank's hand opening the
door.
And then she faced round, with her hands
clasped, her lips parted, her eyes softly lighted
with a light he could but read. Within herself
she felt that gone by was the time for concealing
the true state of her feelings from him; he would,
he must, clearly read them.
He came in; not the ardent lover who had
swept all obstacles that intervened between him-
self and his love—not the man about to ask for a
boon for which he would more than amply repay
the giver—but the man who was bound to say
that which it would be shame, and pain and grief
to utter.
Her hands were taken—and never a drowning
wretch clutched at a fragile straw with more

despairing fervor than did Frank Tierney cling
to the last clasp he might ever give to the little
hands that were so willingly given into his.
“Beatrice,” he began, and then he stopped,
overpowered by his own agony, and the thought
of what would be hers when she should know all.
“Beatrice, you know how I love you?”
Her head sank lower, and the red flag of love
was unfurled in a moment on her cheek—she
did not attempt to speak—she waited for no
fuller assurance but just to realize her own hap-
piness.
“God forgive me—it will kill her,” he almost
groaned. “Beatrice, I am a married man!”

CHAPTER XIX.
THEY BOTH SEEK DISTRA&TION.
THE day had dawned and waned—the day
that witnessed Frank Tierney's embarkation for
Malta en route to the East. Not a voice had
cheered louder than his—not a hat been waved
with a more gallant grace, on high, in answer to
the madly enthusiastic cheering and waving of
hats from the crowd on the shore, assembled to
see them start on their fatal mission, as the gal-
lant little steamer made her way out of South-
ampton water.
In action alone there was peace for him now;
in action, in forced excitement, in the hope that
he might do something signally gallant, and then
die, and be mourned by Beatrice, for that he was
not wholly bad, but a brave soldier—in these
hopes and this turmoil, in the pomp and circum-
stance of war—was peace, or, rather, partial for-
getfulness alone for him now.
He had told her the secret now—the secret he
had struggled so hard to keep—the secret that,
if kept any longer, would make honor and him-

self strangers for ever. And the thought of the
way she had cowered, and trembled, and been
crushed down with mighty shame by his words,
would nerve his arm, in the time to come, with
the wild force of despair.
If she had fainted—or wept and sobbed—or
been wrought up to passion—or reduced to the
utterance of unavailing reproaches, be could have
borne it better; he had expected the latter: he
knew her hot, proud nature—her quick, passion-
ate temper—her prompt habit of speech, which
invariably led her to say what she thought; and
he had nerved himself to bear the torrent of
either womanly rage or repining, which she
might gather up and hurl against him. But he
had not nerved himself to bear the sight of his
own shame and dishonor, reflected in the cower-
ing, shrinking form of the woman who loved
him.
And now he was going away from her—for
ever, perhaps—with no further word or expostu-
lation—for it began and ended in that one sen-
tence—“Beatrice, I am a married man.”
He had, with considerable difficulty, effected
an exchange into the Light Cavalry Brigade,
under command of Lord Cardigan; for his late
regiment—with which, however, he was pro-
ceeding to Malta—was under orders to go
under canvas at the latter place for some time,

and Tierney was panting to be in the “thick
of it.”
So we leave him on his way, to make one of
that immortal band—that gallant six hundred—
who have caused the words “the 25th of Octo-
ber” to ring out with undying brilliancy, to be
the proudest and the most mournful ever uttered
by Englishmen.
“Wanted, by a widow lady, a companion.
Apply at No. —, Piccadilly.”
Beatrice read the words, and put the paper
down with a cold, hard, passive indifference.
“It reads very arid,” she said to herself;
“but as well that now as anything else; it will
do to live by, till I leave off living; and if she
works me hard, it will finish me the sooner, and
I shall have less time to think.”
Mrs. Tierney did not know what had been said
—and listened to-up in that room which Bea-
trice could not enter now without an ague-fit
coming over her. She attributed the girl's in-
creased dejection—her rigidity of eye, and lip, and
heart—to Frank's departure, and Frank's danger
alone; and now that he was gone, and no longer
liable to being married on the spot, she loved
Beatrice for Beatrice's deep love for Frank.
“I am going out, aunt,” Beatrice said, pre-
senting herself, dressed, at Mrs. Tierney's bed-
room door—for, as I said before, Mrs. Tierney

was a votary of that breakfast-in-bed creed which
has recently been aired in the pages of a clever
periodical.
“Going out? and alone, Beatrice!”
“Yes—why not? What am I that I shouldn't
go out alone? I certainly don’t look too attrac-
tive for it—look here!” and, as she spoke, she
advanced into the room, and, pulling back the
curtain, allowed the full, strong morning light to
fall on the cheek that had lost its healthful flush,
but that was still hot with pain; and on the brow,
that had gained a sallow tinge, and a wistful look,
that had not been there—poor child!—even when
she wept for her father.
Mrs. Tierney raised herself on the pillow, and .
looked, with a gathering film over her eyes, at
her brother's daughter—left so touchingly to her
sole guardianship, care, and love. Had she been
the cause of that altered, faded beauty? Had her
representations, fondly, truly maternal, as they
were, sent her son away without those words
being spoken, that the young life before her had
wasted in yearning to hear?
“My poor, poor child !” she said; and, for the
first time since her husband's death, tears coursed
down her cheeks; “my darling Beatrice! he
will—he must—come back; God will spare him
to my prayers and yours, Beatrice; and—you
will be my daughter yet.”

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 225
And then tears, which she had been unable to
shed before, since the horrible truth had been
told her, came to Beatrice—but not softly and re-
lievingly. Some women cry in agony, and she was
one of those women; they scorched her eyes, and
seared her heart, and shook her frame with their
hot vehemence. How happy the women are who
can sob and howl at everything! who can cry
when a life-hope is failing them, and then plain-
tively declare that they feel the better for it !
who can wipe out a great grief with a few salt
drops, and ease an aching heart, occasionally, at
no greater trouble and expense than a red nose
and blistered cheeks l They belong to the race
who are cold in clime as in blood; and though
I will not go so far as to say that their love is
hardly worth the name, it is not, unquestionably,
so well worth it as hers whose tears (like her
love) are like the lava-flood—hot, withering,
destructive.)
“Mrs. Arden was at home, and Mrs. Arden
would see the lady,” was the answer to the in-
quiry Beatrice Constable made when, in obedi-
ence to the advertisement directions, she knocked
at the door of No. —, Piccadilly.
“Oh! papa, papal if you could see me
now /*—her heart groaned as she ascended the
stairs, and was ushered into the little boudoir,

whose charms I essayed to paint in a former
chapter.
She had dressed herself so carelessly—that is to
say, with little regard to the becoming; she had
not cared to put the shawl on with the graceful
sweep in which she so excelled, and she had
dragged the bonnet (they were “Marie Stuart”
bonnets in those days, and required careful fitting
on) too far forward. Her depression had influ-
enced her gait as she walked through the streets—
she had looked nothing superior to the sorrowful
sisterhood of grinding but honorable toil who
daily walk them; but now that she had come
into the presence of this lady, to whom she had
come to sue for service, the old, proud spirit re-
asserted itself, and the old, proud, high-born grace
came back in all its force.
“There must be some mistake,” said Mrs.
Arden, rising, and advancing cautiously. “It
cannot be that you are answering my advertise-
ment.”
“There is no mistake, I hope,” said Beatrice,
coldly; “I am come to offer myself as a candi-
date for the situation of your companion. I
assure you I am quite competent to undertake
its duties.”

CHAPTER XX.
“A GENTLEMAN FoR MIss constable, MA’AM.”
I will not stay to record minutely the various
trifling arrangements which had to be made,
and circumstances which occurred alternately to
hinder and forward it, before Beatrice Constable
entered upon her new duties as Mrs. Arden's
companion.
Her aunt heard her determination with a storm
of anger and a torrent of reproaches, but Beatrice
was not to be moved from her purpose by aught
that Frank's mother could say now. She coldly
sat through it all, and then repeated her inten-
tion, and then once more sat in silence while her
aunt exploded.
So, as Beatrice proved thus unexpectedly obsti-
nate, Mrs. Tierney gave a week's notice, re-
packed her travelling trunk, and set off again for
that Ireland round which her softest, fondest
memories were entwined.
In a few days the unconscious rivals were in
the same house—exchanging almost sisterly kind-
nesses—giving each other minor confidences—


## p. 228 (#232) ############################################

228 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
loving, and liking, and—partially trusting each
other.
For they were unconscious rivals. When Bea-
trice first entered her boudoir, an idea had
flashed across Mrs. Arden's mind, that she had
seen the former “somewhere;” but it had only
been in a dream, she thought—as we are all apt
to think—and, possibly, think correctly, too—
when one of those glimmering recollections flashes
athwart our minds. It was the same with Floss
and Beatrice; she remembered the little dog—
white, with a fawn colored forehead—that the
shabby man had brought up for Frank's inspec-
tion, that happy morning, in the park; but that
he could be identical with the prized little pet
who lay on a purple velvet cushion in Mrs.
Arden's boudoir never occurred to her.
Had it not been for the horrible weight which
Frank had laid at her heart, Beatrice could have
been happy enough, despite her determination
that it could not be so in a life of dependence
with Mrs. Arden. Her duties, as companion to
the bright, pretty little blonde, were not onerous;
they consisted solely, in fact, in being petted and
made much of, and treated in every respect as a
prized and favored guest. In truth, it was a far
happier life than the majority of girls lead in their
legitimate homes; for, frequently, an idea exists
in the minds of their mothers that they have

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 229
desires to do that which they ought not to do, on
every possible and impossible occasion, and that
therefore they are to be kept from evil only by a
judicious course of alternate praise to strangers
publicly, and private nagging at and sulking
with.
This interference with the liberty of the subject,
in trifles, in the otherwise well and admirably
conducted (vide Mrs. Ellis) homes of England, is
a great blemish on our social system. It takes
its root in the stupid, meaningless phrases that
are all very well when applied to children and very
young girls; but that an attempted fettering of
action in puerilities, on the part of a mother, when
a daughter has arrived at years of discretion (if
discretion is ever going to be hers), can conduce
to the dignity of either, is a fallacy. Most noble,
trustful, and beautiful is the bond that exists
between some mothers and their daughters; but
it does not exist where the mother seeks to be
absolute confessor—dictator about everything—
and arranger of her daughter's thoughts, habits,
walks, words, and feelings.)
So, though she received salary for services, and
had taken to the bread and salt of a dependent
position in default of another turning up, Beatrice
could not on that score get up a counter irritation
against the feeling of gnawing grief that was ever
at her heart on account of the man who had

230 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
failed her in everything—as cousin, friend, and
lover.
She had in these days utterly ceased from all
correspondence with the Forests; she did not
like to answer their letters gloomily, as her soul
prompted her to do, because she could not bear
that they should guess that their prognostications
had been verified, ever so slightly, about Frank.
And she could not bear to answer them cheer-
fully, because writing lies was an unpleasant,
loathsome task to the honest-hearted girl. And
she could not bear that they should think her
ungrateful and careless of them; but still she
never wrote. And gradually the days wore away,
and Broome became of the past—so entirely had
a few weeks altered her.
It was a cold, damp morning in October, when
they were recalled, rather startlingly, to her mind
—a cold, damp, cheerless morning, that looked
yellow, even through the blue-curtained window
—a morning to take away all desires of doing
anything in the way either of shopping or the park
—a morning to make the thoughts of the ap-
proaching hot luncheon pleasant to the most
aesthetic—a morning to make the clearest com-
plexioned pale woman resemble boiled pork (I
offer my regrets that no more agreeable com-
parison suggests itself to me)—a morning to make
people say perpetually to one another, “What

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 231
shall we do after luncheon ? we ought to go out,
you know !” in that way that sounded as if the
propriety of the thing was more strongly im-
pressed upon their minds than its pleasantness.
Mrs. Arden had made the very remark to
Beatrice one or twice, as they sat close to the
fire, with their feet stretched out on the fender-
stool—their faces scorched by the blaze (the most
uninstructed on novelistic writing matters will
perceive at once, from this, that I am imperfectly
initiated in the craft of my calling, or I should
never venture to scorch a heroine's face—it
is so extremely unbecoming); and the leaves of
the books they were reading cracking sharply as
they turned them, thus offering noisy tribute to
the “throwing-out” powers of the little boudoir
stove. ,
Beatrice had answered the remark by looking
out at the yellow sky, giving utterance to the
trite observation, that it was pleasant by the fire,
wasn’t it?—heaving a sigh, that was half satis-
faction at the mere physical and mental comforts
of her present position before the fire, and half
sorrow for Frank; and then coming in with the
apparently irrelevant rider—“Wormwood Scrubs
must be wretchedly bleak.” Not that, in truth,
it was so totally irrelevant.
Plans had been half formed by the two ladies,
on various davs lately, to ride down to Wormwood


## p. 232 (#236) ############################################

232 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
Scrubs and have a gallop; but these plans had
ended in nought during the fine days that were
now passed, and Beatrice meant it as a hint that
she would not be a gladly consenting party to
their being carried out to-day.
The very thought of riding had been odious to
her; the little pony she used to ride had been
shot, for love of her, by one whom it behooved her
now to love, and let love, no longer. Besides,
riding was an exercise for happy, light-hearted
people, with whom the world is yet a place of
roses as well as thorns, she felt. And I agree with
Beatrice in this: I have the feeling strongly that
if I should ever be utterly miserable, I could not
bear to practise my now favorite amusement.
“A gentleman for Miss Constable, ma'am.”
Albert, Mrs. Arden's page was the speaker;
and Albert's feelings of intense enjoyment be-
came apoplectic when Beatrice sprang to her feet,
dropped her book, and rushed from the room in
the direction she presumed the advertised gentle-
man would be in.
How well schooled she was, to be sure; she had
decided that as far as Frank was concerned, all
was lost but honor—her own honor; but now
she was tested—for, naturally enough, at this
period, there only existed one gentleman in the
world for Miss Constable—she was wanting
in prudence, in proper feeling, in circumspec-

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 233
tion—in everything but true womanly love and
faith.
“What is the gentleman like?” asked Mrs.
Arden, rather eagerly.
Miss Constable had never mentioned a single
gentleman, of an eligible character, in her con-
versations with Mrs. Arden; therefore Mrs.
Arden was naturally desirous of learning what
was the appearance of a gentleman whose most
casual mention had the power to banish thoughts
of the scorched face.
“He looked like a parson,” Albert opined;
“and he warn’t much like a gentleman as ought
to come after Miss Constable,” he added; for
Albert's faith in Beatrice's attractive powers
was large, and if the Lord Mayor or the Prince
of Wales (whom he felt to be rather young for
the purpose) had come in their robes of state,
and offered her marriage, he would have felt
that she was only receiving her due. So, while
Beatrice was tearing down to her disappoint-
ment, Mrs. Arden had to sit and nurse her
curiosity, and feed the newborn infant on the
nothing that Beatrice's conversation had supplied
her with.
It was disappointing ! to descend the stairs at
breakneck speed, and enter that cold dining-
room, and expect impossibilities, and get nothing
but—Mr. Challoner in return for it all.


## p. 234 (#238) ############################################

234 THE OROSS OF HONOR.
Beatrice declared to herself that she had not
anticipated seeing Frank Tierney—that had it
been Frank Tierney by any improbable train of
circumstances, she would have pointed to the
door, and observed to him that his path lay there
and hers elsewhere, with other remarks of a
transcendental and unpleasantly heroic nature.
Nevertheless, when she saw Mr. Challoner,
the scorch on her face paled away, under the in-
fluence of the sudden revulsion of feeling; and
though she said, cordially and kindly, “Oh, Mr.
Challoner, I’m so glad—so heartily glad to see
you’—she didn’t mean it; however, that is
nothing—for when a woman frankly assures a
man, who is not the man, that she is heartily
glad to see him, she generally does not mean it.
“I have taken the leave that your cousin ex-
tended to me, you see, Miss Constable, though
he is not here to renew it.”
Beatrice hung her head, and said—
“No; Captain Tierney, her cousin Frank, was
gone to the Crimea.”
At once Mr. Challoner saw that something
was wrong—and at once Mr. Challoner had a
faint glimmering notion as to what that wrong
something was.
“I thought from the tone of your letter, that
you were unhappy and anxious, Miss Constable;
and my warm old friendship for your father, as

well as for yourself—(generous fellow, he made
the offering it to her an honor—a touching tri-
bute to her daughter's pride)—justified me in
coming up; we can deal better with tangible
and intangible unpleasantnesses by word of
mouth, I think, than by letter.”
“It was undecided as to what I should—what
I could do, when I wrote to you,” said Beatrice;
“dear old friend—I am settled here, and satisfied
now ; but your kindness in coming to me—the
dear brotherly love and kindness that has brought
you, is—oh so, so dear and sweet to me. You
must stay and see Mrs. Arden now, and see for
yourself how kind she is, and how happy she
would make me if she could.”
“Mrs. whom f* asked Mr. Challoner, starting
to his feet.
“Arden I Do you know her?”
“Yes—no—that is—I have heard her name;
or the name rather, before. Beatrice do you
know this lady? Is she quite a stranger to
you?”
“Quite,” said Beatrice; “I answered her
advertisement, and I find myself situated as
comfortably here as I can ever hope to be any-
where. But why do you ask?”
“Oh, only because I thought it strange that
you should so soon be happy with a stranger,”
he answered, evasively.

“You won’t wonder at it when you see her—
she's charming, and pretty, and good-tempered,
and lively—everything that a woman should be,
I think. I love her very much already—and
she's so fond of me,” added Beatrice, with a can-
did vanity that was pleasant to Herbert Chal-
loner, as one of the old well-remembered attri-
butes of the otherwise sadly-altered girl.
“If she is all this, then,” thought Herbert
Challoner, as he followed the old love—the dear
old friend, as he had called her—up to Mrs.
Arden's boudoir, “when the war is over, we may
see a change in that poor faded face.”
“Beatrice, dear,” said Mrs. Arden, about two
hours after this—when Mr. Challoner had taken
his leave, and they had shaken off inactivity
sufficiently to step from a luxurious room into a
luxurious brougham—“that poor man is very
fond of you, evidently; how simply he exhibits
his worship, too. If he was only something
better than a poor country curate, I would say,
take a heart that will never know shadow of
turning or change; as it is, however, I feel that
you would be throwing yourself away.”
“He asked me once,” answered Beatrice, with
a callous indifference and hardihood; “and then
I had dreams, and said—‘no;' but I am awake
now, if he will only take the trouble to see it.”

ACTIVE SERVICE IS RENDERED BY TWO REJECTED ONES.
“I AM awake now, if he will only take the
trouble to see it,” Beatrice had said. And as
she said it, Mrs. Arden glanced sharply at her,
with an undefined but keen suspicion that all
was not fair and smooth within, as the fair,
smooth young beauty of the girl had seemed to
promise.
“Beatrice ſ” she exclaimed suddenly; “tell
me”— and then she stopped, as the reflection
flashed across her that, fond as she was of
Beatrice, she was not quite ready to give confi-
dence for confidence.
“Tell you what?” said Beatrice, drearily; “I
have nothing to tell, Mrs. Arden; you may guess
how eventful the life of a poor naval officer's
daughter is likely to have been ; genteel pau-
perism isn't conducive to sentiment, you must
know—or, rather, you must allow me to tell you,
for of yourself you can’t be expected to know.
Here is my story, if you want it “told you’:—
A petted, spoilt, ignorant girl—with little beauty

and less sense—thrown suddenly on a world of
which she knows little, and of which the little
she knows is bad; without patience enough to
think that whatever is may be borne—without
piety enough to feel that whatever is is best—
and without pride enough to care what her ulti-
mate fate here may be. That's my story ! Do
you like it?”
“Oh, Beatrice I God help you and forgive
you for those wild words. You can have done
nothing to deserve such utter blankness of heart
and feeling—such early despair.”
Beatrice laughed. The unhappiest thing about
the girl was that she could not soften under her
8Orrow. -
“No,” she replied; “but that is the sorest
point. My fate and state is just as I have painted
it, and I have done nothing to deserve it; so,
finding that undeserved punishment is so hard to
bear, I begin to feel like not caring much whether
or not I do anything to merit it. Let us talk of
something pleasanter than myself, though; I
loathe the subject.”
“What can have been your bitter experience,
Beatrice? I have suffered, Heaven help me! I
have suffered—I do still, terribly; but, then, I
partially brought it upon myself. Without be-
ing exactly wicked, I was very foolish; things
don’t come home to me like they seem to do to

you. I couldn’t go and give up everything;
like—like marrying Mr. Challoner, for instance.”
Beatrice laughed. “Nor shall Iſ” she said;
“but out of no hopes and regard for myself. I
wouldn't do any man that papa knew and had a
regard for, the wrong of marrying him, feeling
as I feel.”
“You won't confide in me, Beatrice? I love
you dearly; I do, indeed. You won’t confide in
me?”
Beatrice took the fair little hand that was laid
so pleadingly on her arm, and raised it to her
lips.
“No; I will not ‘confide,’ as you call it, in
you, dear Mrs. Arden, because I see no use in
laying my burden on another's shoulder; it
wouldn't lighten it to me—the sharing it with
any one, for it's not all my own. Besides, “giv-
ing a confidence’ means laying yourself open to
having your grievance constantly trotted out and
talked over, and made less sacred and private a
thing than a great grievance should be. Don't
you agree with me?”
“Yes.” Mrs. Arden thought she agreed with
Beatrice.
“Added to which,” Beatrice went on, “no
good is ever done in nine cases out of ten; rip-
ping up a wound, for the mere purpose of laying
it bare, and with no hopes of its healing the bet-

ter, is a stupid thing to do. My secret, such as
it is, shall remain my secret still; and this I say
with no lack of gratitude for the kindness which
made you wish to share it with me.”
Little Mrs. Arden said, “Oh, of course!” and
“oh, certainly ſ” but not the less was little Mrs.
Arden savagely vexed at her services as condoler-
in-ordinary being so unceremoniously dispensed
with. People do not like to offer themselves up
as altars on which the hearts of their friends may
be emptied, and then to have their offers—well,
not spurned exactly, but unequivocally declined.
“I think I shall go and call on Mrs. Sketch-
ley,” she said, as Beatrice was stepping out of
the brougham; “but I shall be home to dinner,
Beatrice.”
And Beatrice, perfectly unconscious that she
had given offence or made her friend fifty thou-
sand times more anxious to know “all about it,”
said “Very well.”
Mrs. Sketchley was benign, but distantly so.
Arthur was occasionally terrible to endure; but
he was her son, and, as such, merited something
better than the refusal Mrs. Arden had given
him—in fact, an acceptance. Therefore, as I said
before, Mrs. Sketchley was benign—but dis-
tantly so.
“How is Arthur” asked Mrs. Arden, half
laughing.


## p. 241 (#245) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 241
“Quite well; and in such spirits, my dear!
He has been at the Admiralty this morning, and
they have appointed him to the Vesper gun boat;
he's to proceed to the Black Sea at once—active
service, you know. Dear Arthur is always so
happy and so entirely in his element in active
service. He is sure to receive promotion soon—
quite sure to be posted; indeed, I have no doubt
he will soon get his flag.” (Mrs. Sketchley's
wishes, it will be perceived, were rather apt to
run away with her.) -
“I hope he may, indeed,” Mrs. Arden said,
very cordially—her knowledge of naval matters
was microscopic, so to say, and she saw nothing
outrageous in Arthur's valiant daring being so
speedily recompensed; “when does he sail?”
“To-morrow,” said Mrs. Sketchley; and then
she forgot her nonsense and absurdities and bom-
bastic habit of speech, and the tears came into
her eyes, and her maternal forebodings gave her
dignity; “and if he gets attached to the Naval
Brigade, as he hopes to do, he may never come
back.” And as his mother gave utterance to
the fear that had sufficient grounds of justifi-
cation, Mrs. Arden felt very sorry for Arthur
Sketchley. -
“I should like to see him, and shake hands
with him before he goes. Can I see him, Mrs.
Sketchley "

Mrs. Sketchley was on her false dignity again
now; she didn't know whether he wasn’t out, she
said—and even if he was at home, she thought
he was very busy. However, finally, she elected .
to send in search of him; and then Arthur ap-
peared in undress uniform—for, unlike the ma-
jority of naval men, he was never happier than
when in full plumage and a great state of im-
portance, brag, and egotism.
He overdid his indifference to, and forgiveness
of, Mrs. Arden's rejection of his hand; he even
went so far as to tell her that it was a fortunate
thing she had been clearsighted enough to see
how matters would go, as he should have been
compelled as an officer, a gentleman, and, above
all, as a Sketchley, to have given her back her
promise before leaving England.
“You have a friend out there—haven’t you?”
he asked, with impertinent meaning—for through
his mother he knew the story of her love for
Frank Tierney. “If I should see him at Bala-
klava, shall I say anything to him from you, Mrs.
Arden º’”
And that annoyed her; so they parted, after
all, in anger.
Mr. Challoner had come up from his peaceful
fold, and cast himself like a confiding lamb upon
the wide world of London, with the idea of being
of use to Beatrice Constable; and now Beatrice

Constable, apparently, did not want him. On
her own responsibility she had “settled herself.”
—as the phrase for unsettling all one's precon-
ceived ideas is-in a home. On her own respon-
sibility she had undertaken duties which, for-
tunately for her, were very light; and this she
had done after requesting his advice and assist-
ance, and causing him to disarrange his well-
regulated plans.
But, far from taking offence with her for thus
rendering his good intentions of no avail, he cast
about the more earnestly—seeing that on the
surface his aid was not required—to see how he
could befriend her in that which was under the
surface. And the only way in which he could
hope to do this, was by gaining a clear insight
into Mrs. Arden's character; and to gain an in-
sight into Mrs. Arden's character it simply be-
hooved him to be a good deal in Mrs. Arden's
society, for the depths of it were easily sounded.
So it came to pass that Herbert Challoner de-
clared he had business in town, which would de-
tain him some days; and though he could ill
afford it—poor fellow !—he stayed over a Sunday,
and mulcted himself of a guinea, and thought
himself a fortunate man that one of his reverend
brethren, “out of work,” could be had at the
time, so that he might strive to serve Beatrice
Constable.

Mrs. Arden was one of those women who
have not the least objection to telling a gentle-
man friend that which they would sedulously
withhold from a sister. Perhaps such women
are right in their selection of a confidante, al-
ways provided the man to whom they talk is a
gentleman; for a man can hold his tongue on a \,
topic while it is desirable he should do so—as
thing no woman ever succeeded in doing yet—N
and can drop it altogether without a manifest
sense of injury when such a course becomes
agreeable.
When I say that Mrs. Arden was one of these
women, perhaps I am wrong, I overstate the
case; she did not rehabilitate “facts” and by-
gone occurrences; she merely grew confidential
and discursive on the state of her sentiments and
feelings. Imagining Mr. Challoner as complete
a stranger to her past life as she was to his, she
put hypothetical cases to him, merely for the
sake of expanding and airing her views; and he
being in a measure behind the scenes, and his
powers of observation being sharpened by his love
for Beatrice, and desire to set things right for her,
soon read little Mrs. Arden as plainly as a legi-
bly printed book.
At last she left off describing her sentiments
and feelings so elaborately, and came down to
the statement of a few unimportant facts. She
º

spoke of her early marriage; of her trials while
the bond lasted; of her sufferings when it was
broken; of her undeserved punishment since.
She then gave sketches that were evidently
realistic of the pangs women endured when the
love they had deemed most fondly requited was
returned to them a blank. And then Mr. Chal-
loner made his boldest move, and said—“But
that could never have been the case with a lady
so rarely endowed with personal and mental
charms,” and then blushed painfully, and work-
ed his Berlin thread gloves into holes, as he fired
off the first direct compliment he had ever paid
in his life.
That Mrs. Arden's account of how it had been
the case was not a remarkably lucid one I need
not say. No woman is lucid on the subject of
the smallest of her own humiliations. But,
though she was far from lucid in her sketchy
description of the past, Mr. Challoner gleaned
enough, from her confiding weakness, to enable
him to see his way clearly to the perpetration of
a vile plot, which, if successful, would ensure the
happiness, not only of two people who were very
dear to him, but of the fair little widow herself.
Yes! of two people who were “very dear to
him,” though one had refused the best gift he
had—or any man can have—to give, and the
other had won that for which he had pleaded in

vain. These natures are in the world; they do
not always animate the proudest, loftiest, noblest
looking forms—they abide frequently in temples
so insignificant that they get trodden upon in the
march, and the doughty deeds they do get over-
looked in the battle. But the work they do is
good, and true, and fruitful, for all that.
The sacrifices made by uninteresting, quiet,
retiring people are terribly underrated—more
especially by those for whom the sacrifices are
made. The wife who consistently smiles under
the yoke, and simpers under the mortifications
he heaps upon her before strangers, and submits
to her husband's rough usage and cutting un-
kindness, quietly, patiently, lovingly, meekly—
because, forsooth, he loved her once, she says—
reaps but too often the reward of her self-abne-
gation, by these things being still more unspar-
ingly bestowed upon her. The sister who begins
by knuckling under to her brother in love, ends
by doing it in fear, and gets no praise for doing
it at all. And the lover who, rejected himself,
strives to smooth the path for a happier rival, out
of great love for the one who could not care for
him, is apt, while the affair still wavers tortur-
ingly between the successful and the unsuccess-
ful sands of life, to be considered amiable, but
weak, to be liked and pitied, and—nothing
more.

So Beatrice, now that Herbert Challoner was
giving his whole mind to plotting and intrigue
for her sake, continued to think of him as mild
men who will strive to do good earnestly, but
awkwardly, must be contented to be thought of
by those for whom they plot, and plan, without
prospect, or hope, or wish for a reward.
At the end of a long conversation, held with
Mrs. Arden, Mr. Challoner remarked – “In
truth, such a mind as his is not to be lightly
moved, or lightly replaced "
“Ah! and he was so handsome !” replied the
lady. And on that hint he acted.

the shadow of A CHANGE.
WALTER FoREST, as well as his sisters, had
found it very dull indeed, when death removed
one dear old valued neighbor, and circumstances
removed another.
The day of Beatrice's departure from Broome
had been a hard one for Walter to get through.
Granted that he had determined to “forgether”
—the determination was a hard one to keep.
The way in which he banged the door of his
room was a caution to his sisters to keep out of
his orbit. And, presently afterwards, when they
saw him march out of the yard with his duck-
gun over his shoulder, they resolved, more out of
fear than love, upon not chaffing him on the sub-
ject of the “once loved, now lost,” till time should
have softened the wound, and made the approach-
ing it—with kindly surgical views, as to cauter-
ising—safe. For Walter, though he carried his
gun on his shoulder—thus giving a coloring to
the pretext of shooting, which he offered, in

passing out, as an excuse for his meditated ab-
sence during the whole day—had forgotten to
whistle his retriever up; and this, together with
his gloomy brow, was taken as sufficient evidence,
by his sisters, that Beatrice had been loved with
a love that would brook no light mention.
With whom are a sister's sympathies in a case
—no matter who brought the end about—when
the end is not a peal of bells (and tea, and good
wishes unlimited from the old women of a par-
ish)? With whom are a sister's sympathies when
the active agents have been a dearly loved bro-
ther and a dearly prized friend? It is hard for the
sister who has been made the cat's paw in the
affair, and who has been required to do nothing
but be passive and agreeable—it is hard for her
to wake up one day to the knowledge that one
has been to blame and the other one slighted.
It is mortifying to friendly and fraternal feeling,
that either should have been made to eat of the
odious dish, yelept “humble-pie;” it is painful
to the same that either should have acted badly,
d. e., shown a microscopic appreciation of the
other. The sister who has interfered, by word or
deed, in one of these delicate matters, is sure to
find herself in a bad place when the race is run,
and the two whom she had set high hopes on,
esteeming it impossible that they could do aught
but “come in together,” have run wide of the

goal—shied at some tiny obstacle, and frustrated
all hopes connected with them mutually.
So now, under the present aspect of affairs,
Mrs. Beresford and Elinor Forest, finding that
things were never likely to square themselves
between Walter and Beatrice, grew unjust and
inconsequent, as women will when their curiosity
and feelings are at fault.
They discussed the subject with that contra-
dictory eloquence which is so marked a charac-
teristic of the sex. Beatrice had “tried hard to
catch Walter, and been very much in love with
him, and treated him abominably, and never
cared for any one but herself, or for anything but
flirtation,” they declared in the same breath.
Walter had behaved badly, “raising hopes that
he never meant to realize;” and had “been
shamefully treated;” and had “adored Beatrice,”
and had “never cared for her beyond the mere
fact of liking her as a neighbor,” they asserted
to the friends with whom they discussed the
matter. And the peculiar part of the affair was
that each statement, as they made it, they reli-
giously believed in. So, sometimes poor Beatrice
got hard measure dealt to her in one way, and,
sometimes in another. And, through it all
Walter—for he loved her still—held his peace.
When days went on and became weeks, and
letters from Beatrice, sparing at first, became


## p. 251 (#255) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 251
more sparing still, and finally dropped altogether,
they never stayed to think that she might be
only unhappy—not ungrateful—they declared
her, unhesitatingly, to be the latter. And of
course they were right, for is it not a well-estab-
lished rule that duty first, and inclination after,
is the way of the world. Therefore—though to
write, in her then frame of mind, would have
been pain and grief to poor Beatrice—she ought
to have written; for was it not her duty to give
thus much in return for all the old kindnesses
heaped upon her while she was their playfellow,
companion—possible sister-in-law §
Then came Mr. Challoner's abrupt departure
for that London where Beatrice was, without a
word of explanation being offered to them. They
suspected that he had gone to see Beatrice, and
the suspicion increased the friendly animus, if I
may be allowed such an expression, they already
felt towards her. Why, if she wanted anything,
couldn't she have sent for them, or to them :
they asked each other, indignantly; and the an-
swer still was—Why?
But one morning, early in October, a new im-
petus was given to thought and curiosity. The
post town from whence their letters were sent to
them was a mile distant from Broome, and the
letters lagged on that last mile, by reason of their
being, at the post town referred to, entrusted to a

little Broome maiden, who was daily despatched
to receive them. She was careful, trustworthy,
and to be relied upon, in the main ; but she was
wont, in the autumn, to linger about the hedges,
where grew the too seductive blackberry.
And here we must pause to remark that the
waiting till twelve o'clock for one's letters, gives
an interest and a zest to correspendence that no
town-bred wight, used to his five postal deliveries
a day, can ever hope to feel. There is certainly
a great charm in having one's letters and perio-
dicals handed to one at the breakfast-table; it
makes one linger cosily over that meal, and—if
the letters are of an agreeable nature—feel do-
mestic and pleasant generally towards one's
family. But people can never hope to arrive at
knowledge of how truly important an element in
our daily life is the reception of letters, until
they have been kept without them till the hour
Q. twelve daily for some time.
They had not very many habitually, and the
few they had were not very important; still, the
Misses Forest had a reasonable desire to get pos-
session of their letters as soon as might be on all
occasions. And this special morning, while they
were waiting at the gate—for they had grown
tired of sitting indoors watching for her arrival—
their brother joined them, and asked if “the post
girl was in yet?”

T.
While they were telling him “No!” she turned
a corner, and came meekly along, trying to look
innocent of blackberries, and happily unconscious
that she was wearing a bluish black moustache
and beard, through the perfidiously sweet juice
in which she had been indulging freely. But
they did not stay to chide the trembling sinner
for her tarrying upon the way, when they opened
the bag and found that one letter of the two re-
posing in it was from Beatrice Constable and the
other from Herbert Challoner.
Beatrice's letter to Elinor was short, affec-
tionate, and to the purpose. She had been ill,
she said, in mind and body, which must be her
excuse for the silence she had maintained. Mr.
Challoner had come to see her—had advised
change, and her return to her native air for a
time—and Mrs. Arden, the lady with whom she
was living as companion (Beatrice would never
blench from the statement of a fact), had kindly
acquiesced in his suggestion, and offered to bring
Beatrice to Broome if lodgings could be found
for them for a few weeks. Would Elinor kindly
find these lodgings, and communicate the having
done so, to her affectionate friend, Beatrice Con-
stable %
Exclamations and wonderings were checked
for a time by anxiety to hear what Mr. Challo-
ner's letter to Walter could be about. It was a

254 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
repetition of the statements made in Beatrice's
letter; but it contained an additional request.
“Would Walter,” Mr. Challoner asked, “im-
press strongly upon all his family the necessity
that existed for refraining from all mention of
Captain Tierney (Miss Constable's cousin) to Mrs.
Arden (Miss Constable's friend) when both ladies
should be with them? His reasons for making
this request should be hereafter explained to
Walter, fully,” he went on to say; “but at
present he must ask for attention to his request,
and no questions.”
And so it came to pass that in a few days
Beatrice Constable was back at Broome once
more; and all the village, who had known her
from a baby, sighed to see how sadly altered and
sorrowfully changed.
She could not be compared now with the
graceful, bright-eyed, brilliant-looking girl, who
had come forward in the flowing blue muslin to
welcome Frank Tierney, that first evening of his
arrival. Still less could she bear comparison
with the lovely, golden-haired widow whose
blonde beauty and mignonne charms seemed to
bloom in fresher, fairer radiance when viewed
by the side of the pale, melancholy-looking girl,
whose beauty had been her animation.
The shadow that they had all felt might be
there when they met again at their parting was

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 255
on Beatrice's face now; and they respected the
unnamed sorrow, and held their tongues, as
Herbert Challoner had bid them, about Frank
Tierney.
Back in her old home—for it was in her old
home that lodgings had been found for them—
back in the place that had grown strange to her
almost, so much had been gone through sinces
she had quitted it—back, with nothing better to
do than to weary over the past, and to groan
over the Cross of Honor laid upon both Frank
and herself—there was no reviving power in the
native breeze; there was no soothing influence
in the change of scene from London (where she
had suffered much) to the country, where she had
suffered less; there was no pleasure in the old
familiar companionship of those whom she had
known all her life. And still, seeing all this
clearly as he did, in the light of his great un-
selfish love for her, Herbert Challoner never felt
the hope fade that great good must accrue to
Beatrice from this visit to Broome.
Transition states are invariably queer things;
it is curious to see a grub—a dirty-brown, un-
wieldy little thing—turn into a gorgeous butter-
fly, all fragility and bright coloring; curious to
see, through the medium of “our correspondents,”
a horrible despot, at the frown on whose insig-
nificant but cruel forehead a whole nation trem-

bled, turning into a contemptible devotee; it is
a sight that repays the trouble of looking at-
that of a mere girl merging into a young lady;
the rapid accumulation of dignity on the head of
a hitherto unimportant alderman, when he is in a
state of transition about the city—in the principal
feature of the day of which he is lord, is a most
amusing spectacle; but all these fade into no-
thingness before the interest, to those concerned,
of a transition state of affection.
Walter Forest had been very much in love
with Beatrice Constable; propinquity had done
its work well, and developed a passion, that on
the whole made him a better man—for a man
must be better during the influence over his
heart of a pure, good, refined woman.) But Bea-
trice Constable had been blind to his merits from
the first moment of her eyes being dazzled by
a brighter luminary, and—Mrs. Arden was very
pretty.
When this last-named fact struck him with
dangerous force, at first he was annoyed and
almost angry with himself for acknowledging,
even to himself, the superior claims to beauty
that Mrs. Arden had over Beatrice; but he got
over that.
When a magnificent mastiff, or a splendidly
handsome St. Bernard, comes and lays his
choicest bones at the silken-fringed paws of a

minute King Charles's spaniel, who answers to
the name of “Belle,” the latter generally shakes
her long velvet ears with pardonable gratification
and vanity, snorts (for King Charles's spaniels are
invariably of a plethoric temperament) a gentle
note of approbation, and gives other signs of
triumph at things being as they are. She likes
the idea of a huge, handsome animal eating dust
before her, so to say; she plumes herself on those
small delicate charms of hers which have won
her the humble adoration of so fine a dog. She
picks the bone he brings, wagging her tail the
while; and makes him feel altogether that he is
a happy fellow, and extremely honored by a
particle like herself looking at him. So was it
with Mrs. Arden.
It was only natural that they should all be a
great deal together again; and Mrs. Arden, in
their walks, and drives, and rides, always relied
on Walter, and trusted to him so entirely to
enable her to surmount microscopic difficulties,
and looked up at him with large blue eyes for
assistance, and took such a firm grasp of his
strong one in her delicate little hand, and was
so plaintive, and lively, and gay, and melancholy,
and charming altogether, that Walter grew
several shades less brown, and acknowledged to
himself that he was off with the old love de-
cidedly, and experienced nervous pangs as he

reflected that he was very, very far from being
on with the new.
“Why don’t you come to the point with
her?” his sister, Mrs. Beresford, would say to
him; “what is the use of going on as you do?
Anybody can see that she likes you, Walter;
and as to you, you're perfectly absurd about her.
I wonder what Beatrice Constable thinks?”
Beatrice Constable did not begin to think
about it as soon as the rest; but when she did—
well, what does any woman think who has ima-
gined for a long time that a man's heart belongs
to herself, solely and wholly? She does not like,
unless she is an angel, or a strong-minded woman
—and Beatrice was neither—she does not like to
open her eyes one day to the fact of its being
given to another.
Of course, it is all right and proper that the
love you do not care to have when it is offered
to you should be withdrawn and offered to some
one else. It is all right and proper; but it is
not nice—in fact, it is remarkably annoying. If
the chords of a man's heart have once trembled
to your lightest touch, though you may have held
your hand, you do not like to see them swept by
another woman. It is not jealousy—it is not a
dog-in-the-mangerish disposition; but it is a feel-
ing that the best thing the world has to give—the
love of a human heart—is taken from you, and
belongs of right now to another. You may be

very friendly with him, but you will never feel
disgusted with him, if he is more a kind than a
devoted husband. The warmest feelings of his
heart having been given, as you thought, to your-
self, you will not feel very enthusiastically pleased
to see them heated up again and offered to some
one else. You will see the tiniest fault of the
woman he elects to enthrone in his heart now,
with a clearness of vision astonishing to yourself
even. You will be apt to remark that he might
have done better, and to think that he couldn't
well have done worse. In your heart you are
never sorry if, when thrown into the company of
your rival, you are wittier, and pleasanter, and
prettier, and more agreeable and fascinating than
she is ; nor are you, I fear, very sorry if he seems
to be dimly conscious of the fact of your being
all these things.
But these feelings, happily with a woman
worthy of the name, do not last long; the un-
reasonable mood of wanting all and giving
nothing is quickly over. He loved you once 1
take that knowledge, and be thankful for the
honor; he loves you no longer | Well, it is
mortifying, because every woman would think a
lasting passion a more gratifying tribute; but
make the best of it, and repay the old love more
worthily than by spite and cold feeling; wish
him—as Beatrice soon did Walter—God speed in
his suit, and a prosperous issue to it.

CHAPTER XXIII.
A DEATH WACANCY-WHICH WALTER MAY BE
EXPECTED TO FILL.
“WEAKNEss to be wroth with weakness!”
Why should she blame him for staying the siege
when “no surrender” had been her definitive'
She did not blame him; but there was a gentle
sorrow at her heart, superadded to her other
grand sorrow, that men should be so well able
to survive the downfall of their hopes concerning
her. Here was Mr. Challoner proving himself
anxious to be her friend, and nothing more; and
Walter Forest airing himself in the sun of obser-
vation, as the lover of another woman.
That May Arden was quickly touched by
Walter's devotion soon became evident, not only
to Mrs. Beresford, but to every one but Walter
himself. Walter himself grew strangely diffident
and anxious; he did not exactly doubt that she
loved him, but he doubted very much that she
would marry him. -
Walter and Mr. Challoner—utterly different
as they were on all things—educated differently

º
—addicted to widely different pursuits—were
great allies in these days. Walter got into the
habit of going down every morning to Challoner's
rooms, and talking of many things; and, among
other things, of May Arden. He did not exactly
take Challoner into his confidence respecting the
state of his feelings towards her, but he felt that
Challoner—quiet Challoner, whom in the old
days he had been wont to dub a muff—was his
friend in the affair, and that frequent mention
of Mrs. Arden's name was a safe thing before
‘him.
One morning — one cold, foggy, wretched
morning—Walter, as was now customary, strolled
in before the letter bags came, to have his
“gossip,” as he called the intercourse which con-
sisted chiefly of hazy conjectures as to the pro-
bable destination of “Beatrice and her friend ’’
when they should leave Broome.
“I think Mrs. Arden will be sorry to leave
Broome,” Mr. Challoner responded, as he took
his paper from the bag, and cut and opened it.
And then Walter looked foolish, and asked
“Why?” and Mr. Challoner laughed, and said
“Ask her l’”
Simple as the words were, they made Walter
very happy—too happy to sit still; for somehow
it had come to be understood that Mr. Challoner
and Mrs. Arden were great friends, and that the

lady had few secrets from the quiet, unobtrusive,
true hearted gentleman. So Walter, feeling too
happy to sit still, rose up and said he should go
now, and leave Challoner to his Times uninter-
ruptedly, and then went off, determined that he
would put it to the test—fear his fate no longer,
and win, or lose it all, this very day.
And then Herbert Challoner, having first read
the telegrams from the seat of war, turned to that
column where the truth was to be learnt, through
the noble words of William Russell. ..!.
The letter was dated the 25th of October, and
he read the account—the gloriously clear account
—of that deathless charge when “into the valley
of death rode the six hundred.”
Few that read this book but will be old enough
to remember the throb that went through all
England when the news of that madly gallant
charge was first waſted abroad. Not a heart in
the country but ached with pain, and beat with
pride, as the tidings were brought home of how
our curled darlings had ridden at “the order” to
their death.
That letter containing the account of the charge
of the light brigade, bowed with agony the noblest
heads in England; but, at the same time, the
mothers who wept their sons, the brides their
husbands, the fathers their heirs, and the
brothers their scarcely-parted-with Sandhurst,

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 263
Eton, and Addiscomb chums, felt there was balm
in the thought that they had won themselves an
everlasting name in the annals of heroism and
gallantry.
Herbert Challoner read that letter with a cold
horror creeping over him and numbing his brain
almost. Beatrice had told him that Captain
Tierney had exchanged into Lord Cardigan's light
brigade, and word by word as he read his heart
sank lower.
Then, trembling with horrible curiosity, he
turned to the list of killed and wounded; and
then—ohl his love for her had foreboded it—all
was lost 1 lost! for there, the fourth on the list,
stood the name of “Captain Francis Ballantyne
Tierney.”
The paper dropped from his hand, and falling
on his knees, Herbert Challoner burst into a
torrent of tears for the first time in his manhood
—tears that were as horrible an agony to him
as they would have been to a physically stronger
man.
He did not see, in the list of the “wounded ”
—and if he had seen it, he would have passed it
over without special notice—the name of “Cap-
tain Arthur Hamilton Sketchley, R.N., dan-
gerously.”
Has it ever been your fate, reader, to hold in
your hand that which, when given up for perusal,

will break the heart and crush the spring of life
—the elasticity of youth—out of the being, of the
dearer to you than life? You may keep it from
them for ever—and your deception would be jus-
tifiable—but will others be equally kind, or
cautious rather? No, no! the blow must be
dealt, but woe to you if it must be by your
hand.
So now he sat there, when he had recovered
the first shock a little, with a greater sorrow at
his heart, for the grief that would soon bow
Beatrice's head still lower, with a greater sorrow
—kindly brother though he was—than he would
have felt for a sister. He pictured to himself the
different ways in which she might receive the in-
telligence.
By times he dreaded that stony despair—wild
repining—utter prostration would be hers. And
then he rose up and paced the room, with a sick
foreboding that, bad as his imaginings were, the
reality would be worse.
Then, “who should tell her ?” He had no need
to ask that question twice; his heart, and under-
standing, and feeling of every kind, answered
him at once. He, and he alone, must tell this
cherished darling the cruel truth; on his ears
alone must fall the fierce reproaches, the wild
words that she might give vent to in her first
passionate outbreak of sorrow. He owed it to


## p. 265 (#269) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 265
the memory of her father, and to his own undying
love for her, to tell her this thing himself.
And all this time—though his first thought
had been of Beatrice, and his greatest pang was
for her—his grief for the gallant young soldier
who had gone to his death was bitter, deep, and
true. What though he could have won the hand
and had won the heart of the girl he himself
idolized that only gave the man he respected
and loved a deeper claim on his regard. He
mourned him with a depth and earnestness—with
a sorrowful tenderness—only inferior to that
which Beatrice herself would feel when she came
to know it.
When she came to know it? Ah l and she
must know it soon. Better that she should hear
it at once from his lips than learn it unsoftened
from another.
His “plan” that had seemed so fair but this
very morning—so fraught with rich promise in
the future, for those whom he loved so well—how
void it was, and barren, now ! how utterly cold
and uninteresting ! Walter and Mrs. Arden
would “bury their dead,” would marry and be
happy; and Frank would fill a far-off grave, and
soon be forgotten by all but one, who would soon
fade away, and be forgotten too.
And thinking of these things brought Herbert
Challoner up to Mrs. Arden's door—brought him
12

266 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
so far on his sorrowful mission, all the painful
weight of which rushed upon him, and crushed
him down nearly, as, in answer to his inquiries,
he was told “that the ladies were both at home,
that Miss Forest was with them, and that some-
thing was amiss.”
And now to go back a little.
Mrs. Forest had taken the post-bag from the
girl that morning, opened it, and distributed its
contents with what can scarcely be termed strict
impartiality, for it only contained one newspaper
—The Times—and that she reserved for herself,
sitting down to its perusal immediately, with an
air of determination that implied she had views
as to reading it through religiously; and that,
therefore, the hopes of the others as to getting it
soon were small.
Mrs. Forest was one of those estimable women
who, when they do a thing at all, do it thor-
oughly. She would suffer many weeks to elapse
frequently without troubling herself as to current
affairs or literature at all. But when she did take
her Times she took it unflinchingly from begin-
ning to end—generally winding up with the re-
mark that “a paper was that pleasant reading
you'd hardly think.”
Her plan of proceeding was comprehensive,
yet simple. She first read the births, marriages,
and deaths aloud; because, as she observed,


## p. 267 (#271) ############################################

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 267
“somebody might be born that they knew; if
not, married or dead.” And, perhaps, of all the
minor ills and annoyances of life, that one of be-
ing read aloud to when you dislike being read
aloud to, is the hardest to endure. It is not every
one who possesses the deep-rooted detestation to
it that I do; but even the most tolerant of the
practice find it conduces first to mental prickly
heat, and then to utter despondency, to have
those three doleful columns poured into their suf-
fering, unsympathetic ears.
It is a thing to make the strongest tremble—
that little sentence, “Just listen; here's a bit I
must read to you.” Those treacherous “little
bits "they are so expansive. I have known them
develope into a whole column of the Times, when
thus perfidiously they have been thrust into no-
tice. And you have no redress under the inflic-
tion; if you look injured at having been made to
listen to something, either that you did not care
to hear at all or that you could only endure to
read to yourself, the reader of it heaps further
shame and confusion on your already wretched
head, by looking more injured still, and thus im-
parting a hazy belief to your mind that the not
enjoying such an intellectual treat as has just
been offered is an ungrateful thing.
Now, Mrs. Forest was not what one would be
justified in calling a “delightful reader;” figura-

268 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
tively speaking, the purest Saxon was to her as a
wide, deep brook, in which stepping-stones were,
it is true, but very wide apart, and each one to
be trodden upon with care and circumspection;
and long words offered obstacles that she had to
tackle several times before they could be sur-
mounted. The stops, too, presented difficulties
in her path that the compositors could never have
foreseen; consequently, the language assumed a
character, very often, that would have caused the
writer to tear his hair, and offer other maniacal
symptoms of remorse, at having indited anything
of the sort. On the whole, therefore, it will be
readily believed that hearing Mrs. Forest read
was not all pleasure; nor will it occasion surprise
when I say that urgent business generally took
her daughters out of the room before she man-
gled the literary remains of those in the last co-
lumn.
Having finished these off, she perused the ad-
vertisements with that miraculously keen pleasure
some women find in learning that A. S. S. is
earnestly entreated to come or send to his dis-
tracted G.; that a Skye-terrier has left its home;
that a young woman with a dark shawl on has
gone nobody knows where; that Blondin is going
to carry his wife across the high rope—(it is an
interesting fact, undoubtedly, that a woman re-
cognised as sane should have been found willing

to submit to such an imbecile risk,)—and that
the “divine,” “immortal,” or “matchless” some-
body-or-other is going to sing somewhere, at
seven o’clock this night. As Mrs. Forest re-
marked, “It is so very pleasant to know what's
going on.” So she read the advertisements
through piously, not missing a line; and when
she had done that, she began upon the other por-
tion of the paper at hazard, for she was not at
home here as she was in the advertisement sheet;
she said “it was so tiresome; it was always
changing”—a fault even keener critics have oc-
casionally found with our great institution. The
only rule she followed here, was the simple one
of reading the largest lettered pieces first; and
to-day the largest letters on the page before her
formed this sentence:–“List of the killed and
wofinded.” So she read it down to the third
name, with no particular ebullition of feeling,
merely sighing, and shaking her head, and say-
ing “war was a horrid thing.” But when she
came to the fourth, the paper dropped out of her
hand. “Oh, my goodness gracious me /* she
ejaculated; “whatever 'll Beatrice Constable do
now %"
And then there was chaos and confusion in
the Forest's house; and they all wondered, and
ejaculated, and pitied him, and pitied Beatrice,
and “always said he was such a nice young man,”

and had “always liked him so very much;” and
shed a few tears, because it seemed so terrible,
and finally decided that Beatrice ought to be
told, and that Elinor ought to tell her.
I think—I have never tried either—but I
think that it requires far less courage to take up
a pistol and blow your own brains out, than to
go to one who is very dear, with that on your
tongue that will take all the light out of life for
the hearer. Whatever may be my fate, I shall
never think myself wholly miserable till mine
has been the voice to say words that will stab the
heart of one dear to me with a pain I have no
power to assuage. But all people, fortunately,
have not this inveterate aversion to being birds
of ill omen; and Elinor Forest was of the latter
class. A kind-hearted girl, she could tell bad
news with a properly mournful face, and tender
voice, and sympathetic eye; but she could tell it
lucidly nevertheless.
“It would have been much better for her, in
every way, if she would have had Walter when
he wanted her to; it's too late now. Walter
would never ask any one twice. Besides, he is
as much in love with Mrs. Arden now as ever
he was with Beatrice,” Elinor said, as she was
putting on her hat, preparatory to “stepping
over” with her news.
“Oh, quite!” Marian responded. “Yes, of

THE CROSS OF HONOR. 271
course, it would have been better—for Beatrice;
but I don't think it would have been so well for
Walter.” For Marian, though fond enough of
Beatrice, “as a friend,” liked the idea of a sister-
in-law well able to gild the wheels of the family
coach if she pleased.
Elinor had prepared herself, she thought, for
the scene that awaited her; but she had contem-
plated having to deal with Beatrice alone; she
had not counted on a disclosure being made—
little less stunning than the news of his death—
by Mrs. Arden.
She told it tenderly and well; and then,
amidst frantic exclamations, explanations, and
sobs from Mrs. Arden, Elinor saw Beatrice cease
to be the Beatrice she knew, and turn round
like a wounded tigress on Mrs. Arden—on the
woman who dared to put in an authorised claim
to share in the grief of agonized regret that she,
and she alone, might feel for Frank Tierney.
It was a painful scene, that upon which Her-
bert Challoner entered. Painful to witness
Beatrice's passionate grief for Frank's death,
and her even more passionate indignation at
Mrs. Arden putting in a claim to share in such
grief.
Mr. Challoner had some difficulty in clear-
ing away the mists of misconception that were
obscuring the minds of those two women who

had loved and been loved by Frank Tierney.
But he essayed to do it, and finally succeeded.
He told the whole story that Frank had told
to him on that summer morning after the excur-
sion to the Priory ruins, when the soldier had
first sought the churchman's confidence—the
story of Frank's first meeting with the beautiful
May, when he was scarcely out of his impulsive
boyhood, and full of faith in what was fair.
Frank Tierney had imagined her to be the un-
married girl she passed for in the little garrison
town in which he had made her acquaintance;
and he soon loved, and speedily won her pro-
mise to be his wife. And she kept the fact of
her being a divorced wife from his knowledge
with sedulous care.
The divorce had been of her own seeking, and
was no stain on her honor; but she knew well
how the chivalrous young soldier shrank from
the shadow of a shade; therefore, no portion of
her past life was divulged to him till the morning
of their marriage arrived and they stood together
at the steps of the altar. Then her heart failed
her. “She could not marry him with a lie,” she
said. So, after winning a boyish assurance that
he “regarded her as his wife already,” May
Arden told the truth.
An hour before he had been an impulsive boy,
full of faith, and trust, and love. Her communi-

cation was of so astounding a character that it
shocked him into manhood at once—manhood
fraught with suspicions, but lacking its best
element of sense. He was an impulsive boy no
longer. The divorce he might have forgiven;
the suppression he could not. His love turned
in an instant to aversion. He disregarded alike
her indignant brother, her passionate protests,
and the prayer of the priest. In a word, he
stopped the ceremony, and refused to make her
his wife.
But she was a siren-voiced woman, and he had
adored her; and in that hour of false enthu-
siasm and terrible excitement she wrung a pro-
mise from him, that till she tacitly renounced
him by marrying another herself, or formally
released him, he would not seek another woman's
love. It was the memory of this rash promise
that had made him strive to cause Beatrice to
cease from loving him, by telling her “I am a
married man.”
“I would have released him now,” May
sobbed; “for I see that I was very foolish and
wicked.”

CHAPTER XXIV.
“THE BEST MISTAKE THose RASCALLY RUSSIANs EvKR
MADE, SIR-BUT A MISTAKE JUST THE SAME.”
A SUNBEAM was gliding through one of the
wards of the hospital of Scutari—a sunbeam in
mortal shape—in the shape of a noble-hearted
lady, whose name all men love and reverence.
Sick and feeble now in body—worn out by the
labors she so grandly originated, executed, and
urged others to carry through—her name must
not be idly mentioned in a light work of fiction
without this passing tribute of praise being
added by one who has learnt to look upon Miss
Nightingale as the loftiest type of womanhood;
without this pen, which can bring no fresh honor
to so honored a lady, writing “God bless the
soldier's friend l’”
And presently the sunbeam paused at the
pallet of a convalescent, and the sweet, attrac-
tive, kind face, that we all know and love, bent
down, and the soft, gentle voice gave him a
greeting, and asked after his wounds, with the
interest and absence of fuss that marked her.

He was terribly pale and thin, and the lustrous
blue eyes that lighted up at sight of her, and
kindled yet more at her tone, were too large and
brilliant for the sunken white face. The head
was shaven, too, which made him still more
ghastly; but the moustache and beard bloomed
luxuriantly, and the color of them was tawny.
His voice, too, when he gave the satisfactory
assurance that he was better, and would be all
right again—ohl Beatrice, wailing your heart
out in England, what would you have given to
hear that well-loved voice! For it was—yes it
was—Frank Tierney, wounded and suffering,
but alive, and out of danger.
“And how is the poor fellow who saved me at
the risk of his own life?” he asked. “When
may I go to him # I shall recover more rapidly
when I’ve grasped his hand,” he added, eagerly.
Not yet, he was told; and then the fact was
cautiously added—for she thought it best to tell
him, now he could bear it—that the poor fellow
for whom he inquired had been battling hard for
the small portion of life left in him for some
weeks, but that now death was proving himself
the stronger of the two; “he could not live
long,” she said. And at that Frank Tierney
turned his face to the pillow, and she deemed it
kinder to leave him.
About the same hour a still more severely

wounded, and an incomparably weaker man
turned his head feebly round on the pillow from
the wall he had been gazing at, and asked the
attendant-nurse, in low, broken tones, “the
time.” “Eleven, just eleven,” he was told, and
then quite cheerily and steadily he said, “I
thought so; I haven’t much more leave here
below I fancy; the charge was a done thing at
half-past eleven that morning; but before I go
I’d like to see the man I saved.”
They brought him to the side of the dying
man. Doctor, and nurse, and comrade-friend
supported and assisted the man who was recov-
ering, to the side of the man who had dashed in
with such wild gallantry to save and rescue
Frank Tierney when that murderous valley laid
him low, with the rest of the brave band.
There was not much to be said. Ask your-
self what you would, what you could say, in the
dying moments of a man whose life had been
sacrificed in saving yours? No words would
come. I think you could only do as Frank
Tierney did—bow your head lower before the
shadow of the wings of the angel who had
claimed you his conscript but for this generous
substitute. Bow your head lower, and pray to
be a better man.
“It’s all right, old fellow,” the other one mut-
tered hoarsely, taking as firm a hold of Frank's

hand as the quick-coming weakness of death
would allow. “Cheer up; if I’d lived I should
have been discharged the service, sir, for I dis-
obeyed orders, left my ship, and went up to the
Naval Brigade without leave. When I was car-
rying you off they aimed at me—thinking me the
better man, they aimed at me—the best mistake
those rascally Russians ever made, sir; but a
mistake just the same.”
There was a pause here, and Frank Tierney
(these romances of war try men's feelings not a
little) felt that now if he suffered a muscle of his
whole face to waver, the whole structure of self-
control, which he had built up with such elabo-
rate care, would totter and be destroyed. And
then he listened eagerly again to the tones that
came now from the paling lips with still more
palpable weakness.
“You’ve something to live for, Tierney; you'd
have been mourned if you had fallen; I have
nothing of the sort. But ask May Arden to give
a kind thought now and then to Arthur Sketch-
ley.”
Then the half-past eleven bell rang, and as
the anniversary of the hour tolled forth, on which
he had thrown his own away to save Frank
Tierney’s life, “broken was the golden bowl, and
the spirit fled for ever.”
These romances of war are very trying. If a

comrade falls by your side on the field of fame—as
men call the ground where they cut, and hack, and
blow one another to pieces, in carrying out the
idea of aking who is not gifted with too many of the
same—if he falls by your side in the heat and pas-
"sion of war, you can bear it very well. He dies
with his face to the foe, with his sword in his
hand, with a pall of glory over him. He dies the
death a soldier would die. But it is different
when, the pomp and circumstance of war no longer
around you, you see in all its blank hideousness
the fact that your friend, your comrade, is dying
of the butchery that scarlet and gold makes legal.
Then is the time that you begin to feel that men's
lives may, perhaps, in the sight of the God who
made them, be of more account than the right
of entering a certain port for purposes of trade.
When banners wave and swords flash—when
highly-trained chargers stamp, curvet, and snort—
when the glitter of stars and medals dazzles your
vision, and the cry of on to glory and promotion.
urges you forward with headlong speed, oh! war
is glorious; men have no time to be either con-
scientious or cowardly then. But when—the charge
over—the sick, the wounded, and the dying lay
helplessly around you in fearful profusion in the
hospital wards—then war seems ghastly.

down on his couch again, a change had come

over him; and by the light of that final flicker,
that the lamp of poor Arthur Sketchley's life
had given in going out, he saw things clearer
than he had of yore.
Something to live for! Yes; but not the
something to which poor Sketchley had alluded.
He—from having loved her himself—had deemed
that May's grief, had Frank fallen, and May's
joy now Frank was saved, would be all-suffi-
cient; but, more than ever, Frank knew that it
would not. *
“Mourned P’ay, he would have been mourned,
in truth, by that fair young cousin of his, whose
proud, generous heart had been so sorely wrung
by his parting words. Was the idle promise he
had given—the rash vow he had made when
scarcely out of his impulsive boyhood—to stand
for ever in his path like an avenging spirit,
blasting his happiness and hers ?
Had Beatrice seen how badly he was wounded ?
he wondered. Had she wept and sorrowed for his
sufferings, and sighed that she could not be near
to succor and to tend ? Would her heart throb
with pride when she read of his reward and pro-
motion ? Would she care to see him when he
got back to England, and be dear, and sweet, and
friendly with him till—till “something turned
up,” and that obstacle was removed, which now
stood between them : Then he went off into

hazy conjectures as to what that “something”
would or could be. And as he saw no prospect of
escape for himself, or shadow of turning in May's
resolution, he groaned, in an access of sorrow
and bitterness of heart, that the gallant fellow
who had died to save him had not instead left
him to his fate. His Cross of Honor was too
heavy for him to bear.
This chapter is too melancholy a one altogether
for me to care to make it longer; but, as all sun-
shine and no shade makes but a sorry picture,
these darker tints were indispensable. However,
a writer whose highest aspiration it is to be
amusing, must not linger in the woeful and
solemn paths of fiction too long; therefore I shall
leave Frank Tierney in the hospital at Scutari
till he is well enough to be sent home on sick
leave, and return to follow the again startlingly
altered fortunes of Beatrice Constable.

CHAPTER XXV.
“A LETTER—AND FOR ME?” SHE ASKED.
PEOPLE say that there is this consolation in
everything you value being gone, and in all hope
being over—viz., that you have nothing more to
fear, and nothing more to lose; but it is the sor-
riest comfort in the world. While anxiety re-
mains there is not absolute stagnation of the
heart and feelings, and while hope lives the
world is not all dark.
Beatrice could not stay in Broome when she
recovered from the illness that the announcement
of Frank's death threw her into (and during this
illness the attention of all her friends had been
so entirely centred on her, that no one saw the
contradiction of the report of Frank's death).
She could not stay in Broome—everything irri-
.tated her—the very kindness they all heaped
upon her, and which she knew she ought to take
at least with passive gratitude, was irksome
and wearying; besides, the feeling of unrest that
had come over her would not allow of her re-
maining quiescent. So she gave her address

to Herbert Challoner, whose heart ached alike to
see and to lose sight of her, and went up to town
again, intending to live for a time “on what she
had’ (which was little enough naturally), and
then to “do something.”
Mrs. Arden remained at Broome. Having
once made a clear breast of it, with regard to that
early sad affair, she saw no reason for going away.
She was very sorry for Frank—very heartily
grieved and sorry; but she was not beyond the
power of consolation. Her cheeks grew pale,
and her tones grew softer, and her whole bearing
and manner more subdued. She looked very
lovely in the rich silk and crape in which she
mourned poor Frank—those fair, tiny sylphs in-
variably look well in mourning. Altogether
Walter Forest grew daily more alive to the con-
sciousness that it would be a glorious task in-
deed to console so sweet a woman for the loss of
one who had never appreciated her.
Beatrice had taken up her abode in the square
that has swarms of literary memoirs and nothing
else. No.—, Hans Place, was quiet, comfortable,
and dull; and being all this, it suited her
well. * ,
The winter, the long dreary winter; was wear-
ing away fast, and still she stayed there;—her
sole recreation walking round the old place in
the quiet starlight night, her sole interest, pet-

ting and playing with Floss (Mrs. Arden had
given Floss to her with such true womanly sym-
pathy and tenderness that Beatrice nearly for-
gave her); and her sole correspondent, Herbert
Challoner.
He was very regular with his letters. He
wrote to her once a week—never oftener, never
less frequently; and his kind, brotherly epistle
was always looked for by her with something ap-
proaching to interest on Tuesday morning, when
she came in to her solitary breakfast. But this
was Thursday morning, and what “could it
mean ſ” The servant came and knocked at her
bed-room door, and told her that there was
“tuppence to pay.”
“A letter! and for me?” she asked, doubt-
ingly; and then she took the heavy enclosure,
and found it was re-directed to her by Herbert
Challoner.
She sat down and wondered whether she was
going mad or not when she read it; and then
broke into terrible wailing sobs as she reflected
“that all this would not bring Frank back, and
would be worthless now he was dead.” And
then she read the letter again, and doubted her
own identity, and tried to realize how happy she
should have been if he had been alive—and free
—and some one had died and left her a great
heiress. For the letter was from the lawyer who

had drawn out and witnessed the will of a brother
of her mother's, who, dying, had left “his niece,
Beatrice Constable, whom he had never seen,
but whom he loved for her mother's sake, eight
hundred a-year.”
Eight hundred a-year seemed a colossal for-
tune to a girl like Beatrice, who had been
brought up on the delicately proportioned pay
of a naval officer, and who, but an hour before,
had never hoped or anticipated being the owner
of eight hundred pence.
She knew well, when she came to be able
to think calmly of her unexpected reverse of
fortune, that it would not enable her to lavish
riches on all those who had formerly lavished
care and kindness on her, nor entitle her to a
town house and country villa—to carriages and
riding horses. But she also knew that it would
enable her to mark her gratitude in a measure—
to do a great deal of good; and last, and far
from least, to travel to Ireland and see his old
home.
Her aunt would let her love her now, she
thought, and would surely suffer her to share her
cares for Tierney Castle, so far as restoring dilap-
idations went ; would let her be kind to the peo-
ple around, who had known him when he was a
boy; would show her his old haunts, and talk to
her about him, and let her be the daughter Frank

Tierney's love should be to Frank Tierney’s
mother.
I must chronicle one purchase she made—(and
let those who will call her weak)—a silver collar
for white Floss, with a wide plate in the centre,
and Frank's and her own initials wrought into
the most wonderfully elaborate monogram that
was ever seen. And when this was chased and
finished to her entire satisfaction, her other affairs
were settled and in fair order, and she started
without further delay for the Green Isle she loved
for his sake.
Floss travelled luxuriously; but, for all that,
his sufferings were terrific in crossing; for his
mistress, not being superior to physical ills, was
lost to all things from the first moment the steam-
er pitched, and Floss was meanly beguiled by
the steward out of the saloon where his howls
were an annoyance to the other passengers (who
had no tender memories concerning him), and
basely put into a poultry-crane, where he got
pecked at by a large-legged cochin-china, spur-
red by a sanguinary little bantam, and made to
feel sick in body and mind.
Fortunately for Beatrice's peace of mind, his
collar came out of the affair untarnished; and,
as he said nothing about the peckings and spur-
rings, she nourished the false idea that he had
passed a happier time in the channel than she
herself had.

She was a bone of contention amongst many
enthusiastic car-drivers when she landed, and
taking her inexperience into consideration, it
cannot be thought that she did amiss in the se-
lection she made, when I say that Miss Consta-
ble, her maid, and dog, were each and all safely
deposited in the yard of the hotel to which she
had directed to be driven.
For Beatrice, all able to help herself, and rely
upon herself in matters connected with the toi-
lette, had still deemed it only right to institute
that very necessary (but tedious) luxury for
young ladies to possess who contemplate taking
out a roving commission for an indefinite period.
She had, when the idea of setting up a lady's-
maid first occurred to her, asked herself, half
sarcastically, what “she should do with her?”
“I don’t care to have my dresses undergoing
perpetual repairs and improvements,” she said;
“I can put on my things far better than any
maid can do it for me; and I do not indulge in
a multitude of braids and kinkings that render
another pair of hands than my own essential.”
Yet, nevertheless, after saying all this to her.
self, Beatrice Constable very properly took unto
herself a lady's-maid; for though “needs must”
had her circumstances continued what they had
been when the letter was brought to her in Hans
Place—though then, being poor, that she should

also be “unprotected" would follow in the eyes
of the world as a matter of course, still, now
having the wherewithal, “needs must” no long-
er; and she knew that it behooved her to have a
respectable female with her—one to whom she
could speak, and on whom she could rely.
And after some little difficulty such a one was
found—with this additional merit thrown, into
the bargain, that she was uncommonly fond of
dogs in general, and forcibly struck with Floss in
particular. Moreover, Floss condescended to like
her, which was a great point—for he was a little
dog of an uncertain habit of mind and turn of
temper; rather given to snapping at unwary
fingers, and to taking the run of his teeth on the
persons of those who ventured upon the slightest
familiarity, if he did not chance to approve of
it.
Tea exercises a great fascination over the fem-
inine mind; ladies invariably wax what they call
“comfortable” over their tea-cups. Tea is the
thing they fly to in cases of fatigue, happy meet-
ings, nervous headaches—everything, in fact; so,
as a matter of course, the thing Beatrice did, on
arriving at the hotel, was to order “a cup of tea
and the paper.”
Then she took off her bonnet, and arranged
her hair more carefully, with a more studious
regard for the “becoming” than she had, for

many a long day; but, somehow, now she was
in Frank Tierney’s land, and fairly on her way
to Frank Tierney's home and mother, her heart
felt less heavily sore. Then, over her deep mourn.
ing dress she put a velvet jacket, for the sake of
the warmth; and then, with Floss on her lap, she
sat down to drink her tea and read the paper.
The first announcement that caught her eye
was the following:—
“On the 17th, at St. Philip's, Norwich, Wal-
ter, only son of John Forest, Esq., of Broome,
to May, relict of the late Thomas Arden, Esq.,
of Greenfells, Warwickshire.”
So, May had “buried her dead!”—forfeited
even the poor right she had to mourn him 1–
Well, there was comfort in that, at any rate.
Now, more than ever, his very memory would
belong wholely and solely to Beatrice, to be kept
sacred for ever in her heart of hearts.
“Oh, Frank! Frank l’” she half sobbed, as she
bent her head, and pressed it on Floss's unsym-
pathetic little forehead; “she never loved you,
darling, or she never would have forgotten
you.”
And as she thus made her moan in her private
sitting-room, a young officer, weak from his
wounds, but rapidly improving, was partaking
of some broiled chicken before he went to bed

to recruit his strength with a good night's rest
ere he started for Castle Tierney.
Only a few bricks, some lath and plaster, and
a very flaring vulgar paper divided those who
had been parted by circumstances and seas, by
doubt and distrust. But they did not happen
to be conscious of this fact; therefore, as far as
any immediate good being gained, circumstances
and seas might as well have been between them
still.
When the wounded officer was going, a little
later, to his room, a little white dog shot across
the corridor, and away out of sight.
“The deucel she here!” he muttered, hastily.
He little guessed who the “she” was.
I will leave events that remain to be chroni-
cled in my next (and last) chapter.

CHAPTER XXVI.
THE CROSS OF HONOR GAINED AND REMOVED.
WHEN Beatrice took her seat the following day
in a dashing jaunting-car, and ordered the man
—all “tattered and torn,” but humorously intelli-
gent-looking nevertheless—to drive her to Castle
Tierney, her heart failed her, for the first time
since starting, as to the result of her expedition.
How would her aunt receive her? she wonder-
ed;—would sorrow have made the always stern
lady still sterner? “If she throws what I have
to offer back upon me, where shall I turn ?”
And as she thought thus, the tears rose and fell
—tears that were in tribute to Frank Tierney,
and in pity for herself—for the utter loneliness,
the cold, icy heart solitude that would be hers
in the world from this time forth.
She knew and accepted the fact that no other
love could ever lighten her dark path. The
chords of the harp of her life had been swept by
too strong a hand for them ever to cease to
vibrate; “having known " him she could never
“decline on a lower range of feeling and a nar-

rower heart.” She made small vows to be faith-
ful for ever as the widow of Frank Tierney's
memory.
Castle Tierney was about ten miles from the
hotel at which she had passed the night. Ten
miles to a fast-trotting Irish horse are a mere
nothing, consequently Beatrice found herself in-
vading her aunt's portals before she had com-
pletely arranged the speech with which she re-
solved to greet her. It always happens so. Peo-
ple rarely propose any undertaking at all out of
the usual way without arranging a set form of
address to accompany it, and they rarely succeed
in getting this set form of address out. The ele-
gantly rounded sentences are sure to fail us in
our need; and the embarrassment of a moment
puts the composition of hours out of our heads
completely, and obliges us to come down to the
rational void of literary pretension talk of every
day life. -
It is a fact that no one can utter naturally
sentences prepared beforehand; if we have quar-
relled with any one, and a wordy duel is deter-
mined upon to set matters straight and clear the
moral atmosphere between us, we can never say,
when it comes to the point, the pithy, magnani-
mous, terse yet comprehensive, kindly corrective,
telling things we intended. When a man makes
an offer, he never does it in the language he pro-

posed to himself to use when he decided on tak-
ing the fatal leap. And if we prepare a speech
towards obviating the disagreeableness of a du-
bious reception from a cantankerous relative, woe
for the preparation, for it never gets aired ver-
bally.
Beatrice, with Floss under her arm (Floss be-
longed to that race of dogs who always require
carrying on any such emergency as a dirty road,
a visit to a strange place, &c.), walked trem-
blingly along the square, airy, modern-looking
hall (that dashed all her preconceived ideas of the
sombre gloom of the castle to the ground) in the
rear of a domestic, who regarded her with hila-
rious curiosity. “Forgotten, uncared for, unwept
here in his own halls!” she thought, with poetical
bitterness; and then she hugged the little dog,
whose head Frank must often have patted in the
days before she knew him, closer to her heart—
an attention Floss recognised by a snarling yap
at her shawl, and then a prolonged rumbling
growl.
The aforesaid domestic ushered Miss Constable
into a round room that was situated in one of the
still standing towers of the ancient part of Castle
Tierney. The spring day was warm and bright; .
but, for all that, the peat fire blazing up on the
hearth had a cheerful, agreeable look. She looked
round the room—there was no one there. “Will

you tell Mrs. Tierney that—that a lady from
England wants to speak to her?” she said, her
voice faltering with the emotion the forthcoming
interview with his mother could not fail to pro-
duce; and as she spoke she put Floss down, and .
that little dog, with the proverbial instinct of his
race, which invariably incites them to seek for
new and strange things and to patter into un-
known places, immediately made for the door,
through which he vanished before Beatrice missed
him.
. The servant first opined that the misthress
wouldn’t see the lady at all—then that she
wouldn't this day, the saints be praised l—then,
that maybe she would, if the lady would send
her name, and say her motive for wanting it.
But Beatrice for once took refuge in her sex's
stronghold, reiteration; she would not send her
name—she would not tell her motive—she would
not go away and come again another time—she
would simply wait there while the servant went
to tell Mrs. Tierney that a lady from England
wanted her.
When left fairly alone, she turned absently
towards the table, and leant against it; for she
was too unhappy and heartsick to do what people
generally do in a strange house, viz., look round
in order to gain from the room a partial insight
into the character of the occupier of it. And, as

she stood there, she took a brisk review of her
life during the last year. * -
A year ago she had been a happy, lighthearted
girl—the belle and beauty of a county neighbor-
hood—the petted, idolized daughter of a well-
loved father—without care or thought for the
morrow. Then came that evening when the sun
of her life dawned upon her; she remembered
every incident that occurred during his visit with
horrible fidelity—every light and shade in the
picture memory painted in strong colors. Again
she felt the love deepening between them; again
she felt the cloud lowering; again she went
through those agonies of despair alternating
with hope; again the daughter's sorrow at her
father's death welled up. |Then she saw herself
in London—taking that one unclouded walk with
him—listening to his announcement of his speedy
departure—hearing the sickening words, Bea-
trice, I am a married man.”
Then the curtain fell over that scene, and she
was at Broome once more, hearing that he was
dead; and as her brain reproduced this but too
faithfully, she fell back in a chair, sobbing and
moaning out, “Oh! Frank, Frank! if I could
only die, too !” and then the door opened, and
her aunt walked in.
In no fresh deep mourning robes!—that, Bea-
trice noticed at a glance l—and also with a beam-

ing, happy face, despite a certain air of anxious
curiosity.
She started back with terror, almost, when
her niece's face met her view, and made for the
door, uttering the (to Beatrice) incomprehensible
cries of
“Stop him! stop him for mercy's sake!”
But Beatrice was clinging round her in a
moment—crying, and kissing, and Sobbing, and
talking all in a breath, as women will, under the
influence of strong excitement. And, presently,
Mrs. Tierney was calm enough to welcome her
with passionate warmth, and to ask her, wonder-
ingly, “what made her cry so?” and to tell her
how happy she hoped to be now.
And then Beatrice explained that happiness
was out of the question, of course; but that, now
he was dead (Mrs. Tierney understood it all now)
she must let her (Beatrice) live there, and be
miserable, comfortably; and then she added the
news of her accession to fortune, and offered up
her plans as to spending it on the improvement
of the Tierney estate to her aunt.
“Do you know, the little white dog made us
anticipate seeing another / my dear,” said Mrs.
Tierney.
Beatrice told her how it came into her pos-
session.
“You loved him well, indeed, my darling,”

296 THE CROSS OF HONOR.
the mother said, proudly, when Beatrice had
told her all she had to tell; “but,” she added,
tenderly, “your illness prevented, it seems,
your learning that there was an error in that
Return?”
Beatrice sprang to her feet, and stood erect
before her aunt—all the vitality of youth and
hope asserting itself in a moment; in a moment
the fact proved itself, that she had been quenched,
not put out. Her lips opened, and—the words
refused to come; but the passionate, the terribly
eager, passionate flame in her eyes and action of
her hands cried aloud for fuller tidings; and
Mrs. Tierney, now crying heartily, soon gave
them.
First, she learnt that he was alive; then,
wounded badly; then, better from his wounds;
then, coming home soon; then, that he was home !
—here!—in the house with her. Only, “would
she be calm ?—for he was weak, very weak
still.” -
Of course, Beatrice promised wildly anything
—everything that was asked of her; and, of
course, she forgot her promise the moment he
came into her presence. But I am inclined to
think that the excitement did Frank Tierney no
manner of harm.
He had only been at home about an hour when
the servant had appeared with what sounded like

a mysterious message, closely followed by the in-
quisitive Floss. Not having seen May's marriage
he took it into his head that she was the lady
who wanted his mother; and had, therefore, re-
solved upon the unherolike action of keeping out
of the way.
I need scarcely say that he was soon informed
of the transformation Mrs. Arden had undergone
in name and sentiments; nor perhaps need I add
that the good wishes the Walter Forests received
from their friends in Ireland were the warmest
ever offered to a newly-wedded pair. But as I
like pleasant and clearly defined terminations, I
will add that on their way from the Catholic to
the Protestant Church there were no unpleasant
disclosures made; therefore, the ceremony which
made Frank Tierney and Beatrice Constable one
was concluded without let or hindrance. ,
One short scene more. The time is summer;
the place, a London park; the actors, a Queen
and the flower of her soldiery. We all remember
the day when our always dearly-loved and then
brightly happy Sovereign distributed the Vic-
toria Crosses; we all sympathized, at the time,
with the throb of pride that made each man’s
heart bound quicker, as the Queen herself bent
down and fastened on the badge of gallantry.
In a carriage, at some short distance from the
spot where they were given away, sat three ladies,

and close to them two men stood. The ladies
were the two Mrs. Tierneys and Mrs. Walter
Forest; the gentlmen were Walter and Mr.
Challoner.
“Doesn't he look handsome 7 and doesn't he
look well ?” said Beatrice, enthusiastically, as
Colonel Tierney received the badge “for valor.”
“I wish I had brought Franky with me; he ought
to have seen this /—he ought to have seen his
father to-day.”
“Franky —such a baby, my dear! Besides,
he has a cold, and waiting about like this would
have done him harm.”
“But still, well”—all the mother's pride break-
ing loose—“l do wish that he had been here to
see his father to-day !”
“Franky shows such an evident appreciation
of my conversational powers,” said Mr. Challoner,
laughing, “that I shall make “a story’ of this for
him, and tell it to him when I come to you at
Christmas, Beatrice.”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Walter Forest, blushing
warmly, and at the same time bestowing a hearty
wife's look of admiration and love on her husband;
“and tell him that if anybody (I ought to know
it well) in this world ever did, his father well.
deserved a Cross of Honor.”

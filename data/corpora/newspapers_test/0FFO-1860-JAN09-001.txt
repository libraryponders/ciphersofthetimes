AUTION to PURCHASERS of REVOLVERS.
er revolvers, professed by the adver¬
tisers to be improvements on Deine and Adams revolver, are appear¬

sometimes known as Deine and Adams, but most generally as Adams
revolver. The original revolver was invented and patented by Mr.
Adams while he was a partner in the firm of Deane, Adams, and
Deane. Since he dissolved partnership he has, by recent patented
improvements on the original pistol, made it the most perfect and
rellable weapon before the public, and the only one adopted by H.M.
War Department and the Queen. To be obtained wholesale and
retall, together with guus and rifes of the finest London manufac¬

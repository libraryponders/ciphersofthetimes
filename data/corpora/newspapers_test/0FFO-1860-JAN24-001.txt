HE GLENMORE SUICIDE: WEST HIGH¬
LAND JOURNAL, Oban. Aswe formerly remarked, the im
pression of our report of this sad affair, inserted in the West Higaland
Journal on th November last, contained statemente which we have
no hesitation in saying were entirely without foundation. Our re¬
porter, from what we have since learned, was quite in error in judging
the character of Mr. Gordon Cook, the gamekceper as other than
most respectable and irreproachable. We cheerfully RETRACT any
STATEMENTS or impression ever made or conveyed by us in any re¬
spect to the contrary; and very much regret that our fournal shoud
unfortunately, have been made the medium of convering any report
which could in any way affect the feelings or character of Mr. Cook.

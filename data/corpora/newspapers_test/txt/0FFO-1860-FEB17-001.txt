HE late Captain HARRISON. The official
collecting books have just been issued tous. We beg to say that
we shall be most happy to receive the donations of those friends
and admirers of the late gallant and generous-hearted seaman who
may desire to pay the last tribute of respectful esteem for his memory
by their kindly and generous sympathy to the living. It is carcestly
hoped that the memonial will be such an one as will be a full and
practical expression of that almost universal grief which was expe¬

end, and which made each one of us feel as
he bad lost a dear and valued friend. If anything earthly can tend to
—
—
nd up the bleeding wounds of his broken¬
hearted family, it will surely be found in such a comblned expresion
of respect and sympathy as that now contemplated. This expression
must be made allke worthy of the proverbially generous character of
Englishmen and of him whose character embodied that fine combina¬
tion of all those high, noble, and kindly qualities which they ever
delight to honour. It is men of this stamp who make England
what she is among the nations of the earth, and has made
her
story s glorious a record of noble and heroic deeds. Directions
have been given that to any friend kindly forwarding donations, and
expressing a with to possess a memento of the late Captain, a copy
of one of the last portraits taken of him on board shall be sent, gratuit¬
ously, with the acknowledgment of the donation. Post office order and
drafts to the undersigned, to be crossed Union Bank of London,

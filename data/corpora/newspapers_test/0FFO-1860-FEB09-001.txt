EVERLEY ELECTION PROSECUTIONS.—
Ata large and infuential MEETING of the Inhabitants of the
Forough of Beverley and the neighbourhood, held in the Mechanics¬
hall, Beverley, on the oth of February, 1860, the following resolutions
were passed unanimously:
Moved by Alfred Crosskill, Esq., seconded by Mr. Alderman Foster:
That, in the opinion of this Meeting, the order by the Houss of
Commons for the Attorney-General to prosecute Messe. Daniel Boyes
and Robert Taylor, is exceedingly harsh and unjust, as it is founded
on evidence taken in an inqiury to which they were not parties, and on
statements which they had no oppartunity of contradicting, answering,
or explaining, and that to employ the power and infinence of the House
of Commons against two individuals charged under such circumstances
la a most oppressive measure, and deserves the stronges: reprobation
of this Meeting and
eople of England.
Moved by Mr. William Meldrum, seconded by Thomas Beaumon¬
Esq.
That as the charges against Messe. Boyes and Taylor can only be
supported by the evidence of witnesses whose statements will criminate
themselvee, the order of the House of Commons holds ont encourage¬
ment for a class of testimony the employment of which has always been
denounced by the soundest constitutional authorities, and that to invite
a number of persons to give evidence against themeelves is in direct
contradiction to the practice of allthe
ular tribunals of the country.
will estah ish a dangerous precede
and is in the highest degree de¬
trimental to the interests of public justice and morality.

AUTION TO MEMBERS of RIFLE CORPS, and
Mater
and Wardens of the Birmingham Gun-barrel Proof-house, having rea¬
son to believe that many rites and other firears have recently boon
seld the barrels of which have not been duly proved and markelas
proved, and for the safety of which therefore their possessors can have
no satisfactory guarantee, desire strongly to impress upon the attention
of the public in general, and particularly upon members of rife corps
and their offices, the necessity of being personally satisfied, by careful
examination of each rifle or other firearm, that its barrel bears the
mark of due proof according to law. A special Act of Parlament, called
The Gun-barrel Proof Act. 1855, provides that all gun barrols, ox apt
they are supplied direct from Government, must be proved at the Bir¬
mingham Proof-house, or at that of the unmakers Company in London,
and, if they stand the tost applied, duly marked as proved accordingly;
and the same Act impose heavy penaities on persons selling or kesping
for ale fircare the barrels of which are not so proved and maried.
It is for the public safety, and with a viow to prevent accidonts, that
this intimation le given : and, as the public is general are not familiar
with the lesal proof marks, the Proof Master and Wariens further ive
notice that upon application of any person at the Proof-house in Ban¬
bury street Birmingham, the officers of that establishment will examine
all firears brought to them for that purpose gralis, and state whether
they bear the legal proof mark or not. No breach of the law by sending
out unproved arms can possibly occur except through direct criminality
of intention, or negligence so gross as to be scarcely less oulpable,
and the Proof Master and Wardens therefore carnestly request that
immediate information may be given to them of any rifes or other
arme known or found to be unproved, in order that legal praceedings
may be instituted against the offender accordingly, 25 reward will
be paid upon conviction of any offender to the person or persons
through whose information auch conviction shall be obtained. ly
ordre of the Proof Master and Wardens of the Birmingham Proof¬
house.

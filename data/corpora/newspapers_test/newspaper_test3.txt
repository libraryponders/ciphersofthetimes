account of a statement made by him at a Meeting of the Fulham
Board of Worke, on the lit ult., relative to an alleged nuisance ema¬

Mr. Weiter for the expressions made use of, and of which he has
plained to us, as we feel assured that Mr. Weaver acted only in the
discharge of his dury in his communication to the Board of works, and
that an escape of gas from te meter in the chapel, and at the gate
leading into the chapelland, of which the Trustees of the chapel were
unaware, warranted the statements made by Mr. Weaver, and we do
bereby retract the statements and observations made by us rejecting
on Mr. Weavers character and integrity.

Whereas it has been represented to the Master, Wariens and
Assistants of the Gummakers Company that on the occurrence of an
accident at Kyburn a short time since, by the bursting of a rife in the
hands of a member of the Victoria Brigade, it was found that the
barrel of such rife had never been duly proved; and whereas the
Master and Wardens, together with their Proof master, having in¬
spected the fragments of the burst riffe, und such representation to
be correct, and that the rise in question has been manufactured and
sold without the barrel having been submitted to the test requisite to
guarantee its safety, and contrary to the provisions of the Gun-barrel
Act, 1855, which enacts that no barrel shall be uel in the making of
any small arm, nor shall a small arm be sold or kept for sale unless the
barrel or barrels thereof have been duly proved at the Proof-house of
the Gummakers' Company, the Birmingham proot-house, or some
other public proof house, established by law, and duly marked as
proved; and inasmuch as the master and wardens have reason to
believe that many rifies are now in the possession of members of the
different brigades the barrels of which have not been duly proved,
whereby the safety of the public as well as of individuals is manifestly
endangered; all Commanding Offices of Rie Brigades throughout Eng¬
land, as also the respective members thereof, and the public generally,
are hereby ward of the abovementioned occurrence, and caution
against the purchase or use of rified and other arms without being
quite satisfied that the barrels of such as have been duly proved and
marked as proved according to the said act of Parlament.

AUTION TO MEMBERS of RIFLE CORPS, and
Theater
and Warden of the Birmingham Gun-barrel Proof-house, having rea¬
son to believe that many rifies and other firearms have recently been
sold the barrels of which have not been duly proved and marked as
proved, and for the safety of which therefore their possessors can have
no satisfactory guarantee, desire strongly to impress upon the attention
of the public in general, and particularly upon members of ritto corps
and their offices, the necessity of being personally satisfied, by careful
examination of each riffe or other firearm, that its barrel bears the
mark of due proof according to law. A special act of Parlament, called
The Gun barrel Proof Act. 1855, provides that all gun barrel, except
they are supplied direct from Government, must be proved at the Bür¬
mingham Proof house, or at that of the makes Company in London,
and, if they stand the test applied duly marked as proved accordingly;
and the same Act imposes heavy penalties on persons selling or keeping
for cale frears the barrels of which are not so proved and marked.
It is for the public safety, and with a view to prevent accidents that
this intimation is given ; and, as the public in general are not familiar
with the legal proof marks, the Proof Master and Wardens further give
notice that upon application of any person at the Proof-house in Bau¬
bury street, Birmingham, the offices of that establishment will examine
all rears brought to them for that purpose gratis, and state whether
the bear the legal proof mark or not. No breach of the law by sending
our un proved arme can possibly occur except through direct criminality
of intention, or negligence so gross as to be scarcely less culpable,
and the roof Master and Wardens therefore carnestly request that
immediate information may be given to them of any rites or other
arm know or found to be unproved, in order that legal proceedings
may be instituted against the offenders accordingly, a reward will
be paid upon conviction of any offender to the person or persons
through whose information such conviction shall be obtained by
ordre of the Proof Master and Wardens of the Birmingham Proot¬
house,

AUTION TO MEMBERS of RIFLE CORPS, and
other persons accustomed to use Firmare. The Proof Master
and Werdens of the Birmingham Gun-barrel Proof-house, having rea¬
son to believe that many riftes and other frears have recently been
sold the barrels of which have not been duly proved and marked as
proved, and for the safety of which therefore their possessors can have
no satisfactory guarante, desire strongly to impress upon the attention
of the public in geroval, and particularly upon members of rifle corps
and their offices, the necessity of being personally satisfied, by careful
examination of each rife or other firealm, that its barrel bears the
mark of due proof according to law. A special act of Parlament, called
The Gun-barrel Proot Act. 1855, provides that all gun barres, except
they are supplied direct from Government, must be proved at the Ber¬
mingham Proof-house or at that of the Gummakers Company in London,
and, if they stand the test applied, duly marked as proved accordingly;
and the same Act imposes heavy penalties on persons selling or keeping
for sale firears the barrels of which are not so proved and marked.
It is for the public safety, and with a view to prevent accidents that
this intimation is given ; and, as the public in general are not familiar
with the legal proof marks, the Proof Master and Wardens further give
notice that upon application of any person at the Proof-house in Ban¬
burg-Street, Birmingham, the offices of that establishment will examine
all fire are brought to them for that purpose gratis, and state whether
the bear the legal proof mark or not. No breach of the law by sending
out unproved arme can possibly occur except through direct criminality
of intention, or negligence so gross as to be scarcely less culpable,
and the Proof Master and Wardens therefore cretly request that
immediate information may be given to them of any rilles or other
are known or found to be unproved, in order that legal proceedings
may be instituted against the offenders accordingly, 25 reward will
be paid upon conviction of any offender to the person or persons
through whose information auch conviction shall be obtained. — By
ordre of the Proof Master and Wardens of the Birmingham Proot¬
house.

LAN JOURNAL Oban. As we formerly remarked, the im¬
pression of our report of this sad affair, inserted in the West Highland
Journal on Ilth November last, contained statemente which we have
no hesitation in saying were entirely without foundation. Our re¬
porter, from what we have since learned, was quite in error in judging
the character of Mr. Gordon Cook, the gamekceper as other than
most respectable and irreprochable. We cheerfully RETRACT any
STATEMENTS or impression ever made or conveyed by us in any re¬
spect to the contrary; and very much regret that our journal should
unfortunately, have been made the medium of conveying any report
which could in any way affect the feelings or character of Mr. Cook.

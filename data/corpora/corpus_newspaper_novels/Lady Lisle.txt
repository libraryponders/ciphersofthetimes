CHAPTER 1.
AFTER EIGHT YEARS.
The red glory of an autumn sunset blazed upon the
dark patches of furze and the trembling fringes of
purple heather that crowned the ridgy summit of a hill
in the county of Sussex.
Far away there mingled with the low complaining
voice of the September wind the long wailings of the
distant ocean. Up and down, up and down, upon a
narrow pathway, that wound along the brow of this
great hill, paced a lady, dressed in widow's weeds-a
lady who never took her eyes from the crimson horizon
and the long purple line of the distant sea. A boy, of
about seven years of age, ran backwards and forwards
amongst the furze-bushes, stopping now and then to
gather the yellow blossoms, which, five minutes after.
wards, he threw away and trampled under his feet.
The smoke from two or three cottage-chimneys at
the foot of this hill only broke the utter solitude of the
barren landscape; but in the winding road, which
skirted the hill-side, a low phaeton, with a pair of
impatient cream-coloured ponies, stood, waiting for its
occupants. This carriage had waited for upwards of
an hour, and the groom was tired of driving slowly up
and down, listening to the whirr of the partridges, and

the report of some sportsman's fowling-piece far away
upon the downs.
“Then are you going home, mamma?" the boy
said presently, running to his mother's side.
" Very soon."
“I am so tired.”
“My poor Rupert!" murmured the lady tenderly.
She laid her hand caressingly upon the boy's shoulder,
but never took her eyes from the fading sunlight over
the darkening line of the distant sea ; "Dr. Parsons
says you must have exercise, Rupert,” she added pre-
sently ; “ that's why I bring you up here. Run about,
un about, my darling.”
“I hate running about alone. Play with me, mamma.
Play at horses."
The lady sighed heavily, and, drawing her great
shawl closer round her, prepared to comply with the
boy's request. She was tall and slender, very fragile
and delicate in appearance. Her complexion was daz-
zlingly fair, her eyes large and blue, lovely in colour, but
perhaps rather wanting in expression. She had a small
straight nose ; a rosy little mouth which did not pro-
mise much decision of character ; and long loose
floating curls of the palest flaxen hair. She would
have been a beautifal doll, but she was not a beautiful
woman. She drew her rich mourning shawl closely
round her, knotted the ends at the back of her waist,
and, giving them to her son, began to run up and dowu
the mountain ridge; the boy shouting to her, with a
feeble treble voice.
This he called playing at horses.
The lady ran very slowly, but quite fast enough to
please her son, up and down, up and down, till her
breath failed her, and she stopped suddenly, holding
her two little gloved hands over her beating heart;
the boy still dragging at the fringe of her shawl.
With the last rays of the red sun shining upon his
pale olive face, with the dying light flickering in the
depths of his brown eyes, with his long shadow

After Eight Years.
stretching out grim and gigantic upon the hill behind
him, in the pathway exactly opposite to her, stood a
man whom she had not seen for eight years.
“ Captain Walsingham !” she cried, with a terrified
shiver in her voice, which was neither a gasp nor a
scream.
“Lady Lisle !” He lifted his hat; the September
wind caught the clusters of his short black hair, and
swept them away from his low forehead. He was very
handsome; but his dark beauty had something foreign
in its character. He had heavy but firmly-chiselled
features, an olive complexion, and brown eyes which
looked as black as. midnight, so shrouded were they
by their inky lashes. He was tall, broad-chested, and
rather stout; he carried a cane in his hand, on the gold
handle of which he leaned as he stood opposite to Lady
Lisle. There was no surprise in his manner at this
meeting, and very little animation. After a pause, he
said,-
“ I saw his death in a paper."
She looked at him with scared bewildered eyes, and
murmured,
“I thought you were in India.”
“Yes; but I saw his death in a paper. I was
drinking bitter beer at a club-house in Calcutta, with a
lot of fellows who were playing at billiards ; some one
put an English newspaper into my hand. I rarely read
the papers; but I looked at this, and read, Sir Regi-
nald Lisle, Bart., of Lislewood Park, Sussex, aged
twenty-nine,' amongst the other deaths. The Dalhousie
sailed the next day, and I sailed with it.”
“ Then you still- ".
" Love you. As much as ever.” He took her little
gloved hand in his, and pressed it gently to his lips.
The boy pulled violently at the fringe of her shawl,
and cried out,-
“Who is he, mamma, and why does he kiss your
hand? Why does he love you? He is not my poor

papa."

Lady Lisle.
Captain Walsingham laid his hand on the boy's head,
and turning the pale sickly face to the dying light,
looked earnestly at it, as he said, -
“You are like your mamma both in face and in
character, Sir Rupert Lisle, and you and I will be
very good friends. I will play at horses with you.”
" Then I shall like you very much," said the boy.
6 You are surprised to see me, Lady Lisle ? Yet
what more natural than my coming? I saw Sir Regi-
nald's death in the paper; and on the next day I
started for England. Arrived at Dover, I ascertained
that you were still living at Lislewood. I came across
immediately, without even going to London. I went
straight to the house, was told you had driven out in
the pony carriage, and came here to find you."
“Why here ?" she asked.
“You cannot guess ? Because on the brow of this
hill we parted, in September, eight years ago; and
because I thought you might sometimes come to see
the old spot.”
“You will come and stay at the park ?"
“No. I will stop at the Golden Lion, at Lislewood,
and I will ride over to the park every day. If I stayed
at your house, the people would begin to talk of you."
“Ah, to be sure. You are quite right.”
She had thought for herself so seldom, and had been
so accustomed all her life to act upon the opinions of
other people, that the most obvious ideas never ap.
peared to occur to her spontaneously.
“I saw your pony carriage in the road yonder, and
recognized the Lisle livery. Will you drive me home
with you ?”
“ Yes, if you will come. We dine at seven. It is
past that time, I think; but I always keep dinner
waiting—the servants are used to it. Come, Rupert.”
She took the boy's hand in hers, and they went
slowly down the hill, Captain Walsingham walking by
her sido.
“You do not say that you are glad to see me," he

After Eight Years.
said, after a pause, striking the brown heather with the
end of his cane as he spoke.
“You terrified me so much. You should have
written to tell me that you were coming. I am not
very strong.”
"No,” he said, with a curious, half-scornful laugh,
“ you are not strong, you were never strong. Neitb.er
strong to resist nor to endure. Forgive me, Lady
Lisle, Heaven knows whether the defect is in your soul
or your constitution. I sometimes wonder whether
you have a soul.”
“ You are as cruel as ever, Arthur," she said, her
large blue eyes filling with tears.
" Send your son on to the carriage, and walk here
with me for five minutes.”
She obeyed him immediately. The little boy ran
down the hill to the pony phaeton, and clambered into
his seat by the side of the groom.
“ Claribel Lisle," said the soldier passionately, “do
you know that, years ago, far away in India, I have
fallen upon my knees and prayed to God to bring
about this meeting of to-night? It was a wicked
prayer, was it not? for it involved the death of a man
who had never injured me; but it has been granted.
It may have been granted as my curse. It was a
passionate, mad, blind, reckless, desperate, heathenish
prayer. 'Let me meet her a beggar in the street; let
me meet her a fever-stricken wretch in an hospital ; leti
me meet her abandoned and despised by every creature
upon this wide earth; only let me meet her, and meet
her howsoever or wheresoever I may, as there is light
in Heaven, I will make her my wife. This was years
ago. Throughout these weary eight years past I have
prayed the same prayer. It is granted, and I am
here."
“Sir Reginald was very good to me," said the lady,
as if in answer to this speech ; “I tried to do my duty
to him.”
“O yes, Claribel, I can fancy that. You did your

Lady Lislo.
duty to your aunt and your guardians when you broke
my heart eight years ago, and jilted me to marry Sir
Reginald Lisle."
"They worried me so dreadfully—they said such
cruel things."
“Yes, they said that I was in love with your for-
tune, did they not? They said that the penniless
Indian officer only courted the orphan daughter of the
wealthy merchant for the thousands left to her by her
father. This was what they said, and you-you-who
knew me and my love-you believed them, Claribel.”
“I was afraid to trust my own judgment."
“Yes, Lady Lisle, that has been the sin of your
life.” He grasped her slender wrists with his two
strong hands, and held her at a little distance from
him, looking earnestly into her fair face. " Good
Heavens! what a frail and pitiful reed it is for a man
to hang his heart on! what a shifting quicksand for a
man to build the whole fabric of his life upon! Who
can wonder that the shipwreck came? My poor, beau-
tiful, fragile, soulless Claribel, one might as well look
for strength in those trembling harebells, as hope for
faith and constancy from you.”
“You are very cruel, Arthur.”
“ Am I? Do you remember September eight years
ago ? Who was cruel then ? Claribel, we are stand-
ing on the very spot on which we stood, side by side,
that night. O how the old agony comes back to me
with the old scene! How the unforgotten tortures
return, and rend this tired heart! Night after night,
year after year, I have dreamed of this hill and of the
scene of our parting. I have heard the rustle of your
silk dress as the breeze swept it past the low furze-
bushes. I have felt the light touch of your little hand
resting upon my arm. I have seen your tears. I have
recalled your heartless words, no less cruel to me
because their utterance may have inflicted some pain
upon yourself. I have clasped you to my breast in
that last anguish of parting, and have woke to look up

at the stars through the canvas roof of my tent in the
jungle, and to hear, far away in the distance, the long
howl of the hungry jackals.”
“I suffered very much. I suffered as much as you,"
she said, in broken accents.
“No, Claribel. It is such a common mistake to
think that a woman suffers most from such a grief as
this. She suffers, but she suffers at home; and the
sorrow has often, in its worst misery, a chastening
influence which makes her a better woman. With a
man it is different. He sees his hopes shattered, and
the scheme of his life destroyed, and, turning his back
to the wreck, he goes out into the world to seek for-
• distraction. I will not tell you, Lady Lisle, what a
wide meaning this word distraction' bears. I will
only tell you, that eight years ago I was worthy of
you-to-day I am not.”
" You do not love me, then ?" she asked.
“ Yes, Claribel, yes. My heart never had the power
to love any other than you. I have seen lovelier
women and better women ; but it was my madness and
my misery to be powerless to forget you, or to cease to
love you. I despised you for your falsehood, I cursed
you for desertion; but through eight desolate, hope-
less, weary, reckless years I remembered and I loved
you. Do I deserve any reward? You are your own
mistress to-day. Your aunt, whose influence over you
was so strong, has long been dead. Your guardians
have no authority over you. Claribel, I ask you now,
standing on this spot, where years ago you left me to
fall in a passion of despair upon the heather at your
feet, I ask you, now that you are free, will you be true
to the vows of your youth ?”
She was silent for a few moments. She had been
crying throughout this interview, but she dried her
tears, as she said, in a low voice,-
“Yes, Arthur, if it will make you happy."
She uttered these words as if influenced by her fear
of him, rather than by any impulse of her own. He

put his arm round her, and, drawing her towards him,
kissed her once upon the forehead, and then led her
silently down the hill to the carriage.
“Mamma! mamma!” cried the boy's shrill voice,
as they approached the phaeton; “I thought you were
never coming. I am so hungry, and it's nearly dark,
and Brooks is tired of telling me stories.”
“Because you've had 'em all twice over, Sir Rupert,"
said the groom, touching his hat.
“So Brooks tells you stories, Sir Rupert," said the
Captain, laughing; “ Jack the Giant Killer, I suppose,
and Tom Thumb. I daresay I shall find some stories to
tell you, stories about India.”
“I like you very much, and I should like you to be
my new papa. Brooks says "
“ Jump in, Sir Rupert,” said the Captain. “It's
nearly eight o'clock, and mamma is going to drive me
home.”
The light phaeton dashed along the hilly road, and
after half-an-hour's drive entered the rustic gates of
Lislewood Park, one of the most extensive and prettiest
gentleman's seats in the county of Sussex.
The little baronet was delighted with his new ac-
quaintance, and kept him employed till nine o'clock in
telling and inventing stories for his amusement; but at
that hour a grave nurse appeared at the drawing-room
door, and with considerable difficulty persuaded Sir
Rupert to retire with her to his own apartments.”
“You spoil your son, Claribel," said the Captain,
when the boy was gone.
“How could I help it? He is all I have had to
love."
“He is a pretty boy, but he does not look strong."
"No; he is not strong. That is one reason why I
let him have his own way a great deal. The physicians
tell me he must not be opposed. He is such a nervous
child.”
“Is he clever ?” asked Captain Walsingham.
“Why, no; I scarcely think he is exactly clever,"

said Lady Lisle, with considerable hesitation ; "he is
backward with his studies. Mr. Maysome, the curate,
comes over every morning from the village, and teaches
him for a couple of hours, but I fear he finds him rather
dull.”
“Does Mr. Maysome complain of him?"
“He does sometimes," said Lady Lisle, thoughtfully.
“ Never mind, Claribel : he will be a rich man, and
he has no need to be clever. It is we poor fellows,
who have the battle of life to fight, who want all the
brains."
The Captain said this with a bitter laugh. He rose
from his seat presently, and walked to the fireplace,
where he stood in a lounging attitude, looking down
into the blaze at his feet. The firelight glancing fitfully
upon his dark face revealed the gloomy shadows in his
large brown eyes, and the rigid lines about his hand-
some mouth, shrouded by a black moustache, which he
stroked restlessly with his powerful hand, as he stood
brooding above the blaze. Lady Lisle, seated on the
other side of the hearth, close to a small table with a
low green-shaded lamp, looked up at him with wonder-
ing eyes.
“ You are changed, Captain Walsingham,” she said,
after a pause.
He did not answer her immediately, but shrugged
his shoulders, and stood pushing the polished handle
of the poker backwards and forwards upon the bronze
rail of the fender with the toe of his boot. Presently
he said,
“You think so ? Changed ! Changed, after eight
years of the life men lead out in India ? Eight years'
pale ale and brandy drinking; eight years' billiards,
blind hookey, and écarté, hazard, and unlimited loo,
cricketing, racing, pig-sticking, tiger-hunting, quarrel-
ling, flirting, fighting, borrowing, spending,-bah ! Lady
Lisle, I had better not finish the catalogue, you might
object to some of the items.”
“ Arthur," said Claribel Lisle, twisting her long flaxen

Lady Lisle.
curls absently round and round her white fingers, “ do
you know that you have become quite a bear?”
“A bear!” He laughed a short mocking laugh.
“And that is all the change you can find in me after
these eight years of separation ? My manners are not
quite so polished; I speak in a rough deep voice; I say
impertinent things, and laugh aloud in people's faces,
I am impatient, and not good-tempered; or that is to
say, I do not even pretend to be good-tempered, as well-
bred people should. I dine in a frock-coat and a
coloured waistcoat; and call upon a lady who jilted me
eight years ago, and whom I have not seen since that
period, at six o'clock in the afternoon. Not finding her
at home, I follow her in her afternoon ramble, intrude
upon her in her lonely walk, and ask her to marry me
before her year of widowhood even has expired. In
short, Lady Lisle, to use your own forcible expression,
I have become a bear.”
As he finished speaking, he looked up at the reflection
of his face in the glass over the chimney-piece, and run-
ning one hand through his thick black hair, pushed it
in a rough mass off his forehead, and contemplated him-
self for some moments with a thoughtful smile. Lady
Lisle watched him with a puzzled expression, but did not
speak. His influence over her was evidently very great;
and there was always something of fear in her manner
towards him—a fear which seemed to arise from a con-
sciousness of his strength, and of her own weakness ;
but which was, at the same time, mingled with a know-
ledge of her immense power over him—a power she
was not slow to exercise in puerile acts of feminine
presumption.
“Lady Lisle, you think me changed from what I was
in September, eight years ago ? What if I say that I
am not the same man I was then ? "
“ Arthur!”
“Look at my face in the glass ; come here, Claribel;
stand by my side, and look at it with me. No very
great changes there, are there ? Two or three scarcely

perceptible wrinkles under the eyes, a few hard lines
about the mouth, and the bronze of an Indian sun.
Good heavens ! how little the face reflects the heart !
and what a scarred, battered, weather-beaten, branded
visage this would be if it bore the outward traces of
every inward storm! Yet see what a handsome useful
mask it may be made, and how the great enigmaman
-can hide behind it !”
“ Arthur, I hate to hear you talk like this.”
“Yes; it is bearish, is it not? I ought to be sitting
at your feet, telling you the pretty rose-water story of
my eight years of Indian life. How, for your sake, I
never tasted bitter ale; how, for love of you, I held
myself aloof from the dice-box and the card-table, and
fled from the society of women, to brood over the me-
mory of your beautiful face. This would be the right
thing, would it not? Claribel Lisle, I tell you none of
this. I am a bear, as you say, and I will tell you the
truth. Listen to me, then. I hate you as much as I
love you. My heart is rent asunder by these two pas-
sions, and I scarcely know which of the two has brought
me from India, and to your feet to-night. It was a
murder which you committed by your treachery of eight
years ago; and it is the ghost of the Arthur Walsingham
whom you then killed that stands by your side at this
moment. For your sake, and through your treachery
I have been a gamester, a drunkard, and a rogue. The
memory of you, pursuing me in every hour of my life,
has driven me to the brandy-bottle, the hazard-table,
and the smiles of artless women, for relief from its cruel
torture. This is what I must tell you, Lady Lisle, if I
speak at all.”
“ Arthur, it breaks my heart to hear you talk like
this,” she said, as he turned away, and buried his face
upon his folded arms. " Arthur, I have promised to do
all in my power to atone for the past. I have promised,
have I not ?" she repeated, trying to lift his head with
her two weak hands.
“Vos yes ; you are very good, Claribel, and you have

Lady Lisle.
promised to be mine-mine at last. O my darling, niy
tyrant, my beloved and cruel Claribel, pray that the
pitter past may be blotted away for ever, and that no
dire effects from that dark page may ever fall upon this
gentle head.” He drew her fair curls upon his shoulder,
and looked down with a tender pitying but gloomy
glance. “ Claribel, you have promised to marry me.
Do you repent that rash vow? Was it terror that
prompted your compliance with my prayer? Remember,
remember, beloved, it is not too late. One word, and
to-night I leave this place ; in two days I shall have
sailed for India. One word, Claribel, and you are free
from me for ever.”
She lifted her tearful eyes to his, and laying her little
hand in his wide palm, said, in a low voice broken by
sobs,-
“I never, never loved any one but you. I was very
wicked when I jilted you, and married Sir Reginald
Lisle, but I was too great a coward to resist the authority
of my friends. Many and many a night during my
husband's lifetime I have sat opposite to him by this
very hearth, thinking of you far away in India ; thinking
of you, till this room and my husband's face have faded
away from me, and I have seen you wounded in battle,
or asleep in some gloomy forest, lonely, deserted, ill,
dying. But thank heaven! you are safe, you have
returned to me, you love me still.”
“Still, and for ever. I tell you, it is my madness,
Claribel Lisle. You will marry me, then, whether it be
for good or ill ? ”
“Whether it be for good or ill. Yes.” She trem-
bled as she looked up at his sombre face, and repeated
the words after him, falteringly and slowly, like a little
child.

CHAPTER II.
RETROSPECTIVE.
THE worthy parishioners of Lislewood in the county of
Sussex could well remember how, eight years before, a
certain Captain Walsingham, of the East India Com-
pany's service, had come to the village on a visit to Sir
Reginald Lisle. They remembered his handsome face,
his dashing manner, and military walk, the jingle of his
spurs, as he strode over the rough paving of the long
village street; the crack of his light riding-whip, swing-
ing in his careless hand ; the gloss of his fierce black
moustache-he was in a cavalry regiment-his friendly
smile for the little children, as they gathered about him,
to stare at and admire the great officer; his hearty voice,
when he stopped before the Golden Lion, to watch the
London coach come in, or when he loitered at the black-
smith and veterinary surgeon's to ask a question about
what it was that ailed that off pastern-joint of his hunter,
Dragoon. A gallant and a noble gentleman! Handsome
of face, generous of heart, and free of speech, thought
the inhabitants of Lislewood. They remembered, too,
how he had fallen madly, desperately, recklessly, and
stupidly in love with Miss Claribel Merton, the orphan
heiress of a rich East India merchant, resident in Lisle-
wood under the guardianship of her aunt, Miss Chip-
pendale, the maiden sister of a late rector of the parish.
They remembered this love-affair, because Captain Arthur
Walsingham, being by no means the most discreet of
persons, had made at least twenty confidants, and had
threatened, a great many times, either to shoot or drown
himself. Indeed, Martin, his valet-an excellent creature
had told the barmaid at the Golden Lion, that he had
hidden the Captain's pistols, and only regretted that it
was not possible for him to hide the river. Captain
Walsingham, it must needs be admitted, had been noisy,
And wrong-headed, and foolish, in his love for the fain

faced heiress, with the pale flaxen hair and girlish languid
manners. He had sworn, and threatened, and protested;
he had been accused of courting her for her fortune, and
he had prayed to be allowed to take her without a penny,
and to endow an hospital with old Merton's thousands.
All Lislewood had looked on, and sympathized, and
wept over this little love-story. Every stolen meeting
on the broad downs, or the great bare hills that encircled
the little village, was known and commented on. Every
night which the foolish soldier spent in pacing up and
down before the little garden of Miss Chippendale's
house, to watch the feeble glimmer of the night-light
upon the blind in her window ; every letter smuggled
into the citadel by the maid-servants; the spade-guinea,
which the Captain had begged the blacksmith to break
in half for him, and the fragments of which had been
divided between the lovers; the terrific scenes between
the suitor and the young lady's protectress-all these
things were openly discussed at Lislewood tea-parties.
By young ladies, who thought the handsome Captain a
great deal too good for “that insipid thing," as they
rather disrespectfully designated Miss Merton; by elderly
spinsters, who were positive it was only her money ho
was after ; by young men, who honoured and believed
in the desperate Indian soldier; by grey-headed bachelors,
who called him a fool for his noisy blustering passion;
by everybody Arthur Walsingham's courtship was can-
vassed, and his merits decided upon.
Perhaps the only person who was really quiescent in
the affair was the young heroine of this sentimental
drama. Claribel Merton made no confessions, and
elected no confidants. You never heard of her having
made a scene, or of her having fainted at the feet of her
inexorable guardian, or of her having been discovered
in an attempt at answering one of her suitor's desperate
epistles. There had been meetings, it is true, upon the
lonely hills ; but these were supposed, on her side at
least, to have been accidental. The Captain had
watched the house, and followed her when she went out

alone. In short, she was very rarely heard of in the
matter. Fair and pale, with long flaxen ringlets, smooth
and shining, making an aureole of yellow gold round
her graceful drooping head, she met the gaze of Lisle-
wood every Sunday morning in the village church, and
none could ever see her change from red to pale, or pale
to red, under the burning gaze of Arthur Walsingham,
gnawing the binding of his prayer-book, absently, in
the free seats. He might scandalize all the churchgoera
of Lislewood by keeping his seat throughout the reading
of the Psalms, sitting with his elbows on the rail before
him, and staring fiercely at her, haggard and unshaven,
hollow-eyed and ghastly, in the morning sunshine; he
might rush out in the middle of the rector's sermon,
with the heels of his boots resounding over the pave-
ment of the holy edifice; he might disturb every
member of the congregation; he might so distract the
minds of the charity-children as to cause those young
persons to describe themselves as “ miserable Walsing-
hams" in the responses of the Litany; but do what he
might, he could not discompose Claribel Merton. When
the sermon had been finished, and the blessing given,
and when the organist had played one out of the three
voluntaries in his répertoire, and the congregation had
slowly dispersed, Miss Merton would walk calmly down
the narrow churchyard pathway, past the Captain, who
was wont to lie in wait for her, half hidden amongst
the tall white tombstones. With what sad despairing
eyes the passionate soldier looked upward to the bright
parasol that screened his divinity's tranquil face ! If her
silk dress touched him as she went by, he would tremble
in every limb ; but neither surprise nor agitation,
neither distress nor annoyance, neither love nor pity,
were ever to be seen in her calm blue eyes.
“You think me a fool, because I am going mad for
a wax doll !” Arthur Walsingham cried out one night
at Lislewood Park, when he had been drinking more
than usual, and the baronet and his other companions
had rallied him upon his silly passion. “I know, as

well as you, what a foolish school-boy's fever it is; but
that makes it no better for me, if I die of it.”
But if Miss Claribel Merton had, as her enemies
declared, many attributes in common with a pretty
blue-eyed, flaxen-haired, waxen image fashioned by the
toy-maker, she was not the less an heiress and a beau-
tiful woman ; and whether it was because of this, or
whether it was the noise and the excitement caused by
the Captain's furious courtship, I cannot tell, but, six
weeks after the arrival of the Indian officer at Lislewood
Park, she became the fashion. She became the fashion !
If she had been as ugly as sin, she might have married
the handsomest man in the parish. If she had been as
poor as Job, she might have married the richest. She
might have been hopelessly stupid, or incredibly igno-
rant; she might have had red hair, or even a hump,
and, being the fashion, she would have been courted,
followed, flattered, admired, sued, and sought after, as
she was. She had, all of a sudden, been stamped with
that wonderful hall-mark which changes the commonest
metal into thrice-refined gold, and people who had not
the smallest personal regard for her were dying to
marry her. It was not she whom they wanted, but her
notoriety. They wanted to hook themselves on to her
reputation, and share in the din and the clatter. She
was as fashionable in the village of Lislewood as a man
who has written a novel about the working-classes,
or been tried for murder, is in London. She was the
rage; and, eight weeks after the Captain's arrival, Sir
Reginald Lisle-who rarely in the whole course of his
brief and useless existence had desired to possess himself
of anything, except for the pleasure of taking it away
from somebody else--proposed for her hand, and, after
a brief delay, was, at the instigation of her aunt, duly
accepted. Then it was that there was such a terrible
scene upon the summit of the hill known as Beecher's
Ride; then it was that, on the Captain's not coming
home to the Park to dinner, Martin, his man, had been
despatched to seek him, and, going instinctively to the

bill, had found his master lying, in a sort of torpor,
upon the wet grass, under the darkness. Then it was
that the soldier had wanted to fight his host, Sir
Reginald, and that there had been such frightful
tumults between the rejected and the accepted suitors;
tumults only resulting, however, in the departure of the
Captain, who shook the dust from his boots at the hall-
door of his rival's mansion ; wished his foe happiness
with his heartless bride ; and galloped madly down the
village street, and thence hurried away by express train
to the India House, praying to be sent out somewhere,
where the enemies of his country would be pitiful
enough to shoot him.
People in Lislewood wondered whether, after all this
had happened, Claribel Merton was sorry for having
consented to the rejection of this mad-headed lover.
As usual, they could discover nothing from her face. It
was at all times a face which revealed no secrets.
Perfect in feature, most delicate in colouring, but in.
scrutable, enigmatic, almost expressionless. She mar-
ried Sir Reginald Lisle without loving him, as passively
as she had taken her music-lessons without having an
ear for harmony, and her drawing-lessons without being
blessed with an eye for form. Whatever other people
bade her do, she did. She would have married the
Captain at his command, being utterly incapable to
resist the influence of a stronger mind than her own,
had she not been restrained by the counter-influence of
her aunt, which, from the force of long habit, was more
powerful still. She was entirely at the mercy of those
who controlled or counselled her. She saw with their
eyes, thought with their thoughts, and spoke with their
words. The Captain might be the truest and noblest
of mankind ; but if those about her chose to call him
false, Miss Merton, too, would doubt him. She would
say a hundred cruel words to him in her low soft voice,
which were mere repetitions of the phrases of her aunt.
Rudderless, anchorless, driven about by every wind, she
consented, after two or three days of steady-going

feminine persecution, to reject the Captain and to marry
the baronet; and before the transport, which carried
the soldier and the troops under his charge, had touched
at Malta, on her way out to the East, the village
children were strewing flowers in the pathway of Sir
Reginald and Lady Lisle.
Eight years had passed since the bright October
morning upon which Claribel Merton gave her hand to
the young baronet. Eight years, and Sir Reginald
Malvin Bernard Lisle had taken part in another solemn
ceremonial, in the same village church. This time the
baronet's part had been a very quiet one; for the mortal
remains of the young man had lain in the cloth-covered
coffin, with its silver armorial bearings and costly
scroll-work, under the voluminous velvet of the heavy
pall, borne by the best gentlemen of Lislewood. Under
the worm-eaten statues of Marmaduke Lisle, Knight,
an esteemed servant of her gracious majesty Elizabeth,
and Martha his wife, kneeling face to face, with a
carved stone cushion between them, there was now a
tablet of polished Sienna marble, setting forth how
Reginald Malvin Bernard, son of the above Oscar, last
baronet, was buried in the vault below the chancel,
where slept the ashes of his noble forefathers. Sir
Reginald had died of a lingering decline, a slow wasting
away; a kind of disease which had been very fatal to
the house of Lisle. For three generations the heads
of the family had died before they had attained their
thirtieth year, leaving only sons to inherit the title and
property; so that in the event of Sir Reginald's having
died childless, a very distant relation, an amateur in
music and painting, resident at Naples, would have
succeeded to the baronetcy. But Sir Reginald, as his
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had done
before him, left an only son; a pale-faced delicate boy
of six years of age, resembling his mother both in
person and disposition; like her, quiet and unimpulsive;
like her, unblest with brilliant talents or energy of
character.

Retrospective.
During the seven years of their married life Sir
Reginald and Lady Lisle were not an unhappy couple.
He was fond of field-sports, horses and dogs, gunnery,
and the turf; all those amusements so dear to gentle-
men who have plenty of money and very little to do.
He had a farm, and tried improvements and new sys-
tems in farming, which cost him a great deal, and never
resulted in any good. But the steam-ploughs and the
complicated patent machinery for the economization of
labour were so many playthings which afforded amuse-
ment to the baronet while the chance of novelty re-
mained to them; and he would drag his delicate young
wife through ploughed fields and damp meadow-lands,
in rain or sunshine, to see his agricultural experiments.
Sometimes he kept racehorses, and all Lislewood would
be noisy with the clatter of trainers and stable-boys;
but he would grow tired of this, as of everything else,
and some fine morning “All that valuable racing stock,
the property of Sir Reginald Lisle, including Claribel,
the winner of the Lislewood Park Stakes, &c. &c.” would
be advertised for sale in the columns of Bell's Life.
Every occupation wearied him; every amusement grew
flat and stale for him; and it almost seemed as if he
fell into a decline at last because he could think of
nothing else to do.
Claribel was gentle and tractable, if not affectionate ;
she went with him, if he chose to go abroad: she would
drink nauseous waters at German spas, if he asked her
to drink them ; she would saunter with him through
Italian and Flemish picture galleries, through wonderful
old churches and cathedrals rich in the rarest treasures
of art; neither of them being able to distinguish a
Titian from a Teniers, or a Salvator Rosa from a
Rubens, without the aid of a guide or a catalogue. If
the baronet had asked his wife to ascend Mont Blanc,
she would have toiled bravely to the summit, though
she had died there. It was scarcely a virtue, this tacit
obedience, this smiling assent; it was rather the con.
stitutional indolence of a lymphatic temperament. Anya

thing was less troublesome to Lady Lisle than resiste
ance. She would listen to her husband when he talked ;
she would read aloud to him on summer evenings,
wading patiently through the descriptions of pugilistic
encounters in Bell's Life, though she did not under-
stand a word of the sporting jargon; she would sit in
her pony phaeton through a meeting at some county
race-course, though she did not know the winner when
she saw him, and scarcely remembered the names of
her husband's horses without referring to her card.
When Sir Reginald fell ill, she nursed him tenderly
and patiently ; if he was fretful, she bore with him ;
if he was low-spirited, she did her best to comfort him ;
and when he died, she was sorry for him-after her
own quiet fashion. She hurried away from Lislewood
directly after the funeral, and hid herself in some quiet
watering-place on the Sussex coast, with her little son
and her confidential maid. She felt a nervous horror
of the great luxurious house, with its splendid rooms,
into which death had so lately entered. She fled shud.
dering from the gloomy avenues in the thickly-wooded
park. Her aunt had died soon after her marriage; she
had no relations, and very few friends ; scarcely, perhaps,
one human being worthy of the name of a friend. She
was, however, passionately fond of her son, and to him
she devoted herself entirely.
Did Claribel Lisle think of the handsome soldier now
that she was free? She may have done so sometimes,
and it might have been part of her grief to think how
she had wounded and tortured that gallant heart eight
years before. She did not know whether he was alive
or dead, and she had no means of ascertaining. Sir
Reginald had never breathed the name of his sometime
friend after the quarrel which had separated the two
mon. She dared not think of him. It seemed wicked,
heartless, unwomanly, to remember that there had ever
been such a man as Arthur Walsingham in the world,
while the tablet was yet new in Lislewood Church, and
the coffin-plate scarcely tarnished in the vault below

the chancel. Lady Lisle went on the Continent with
her son and her maid ; she showed the boy thu long
dim cathedrals in which she had walked with his dead
father; she took him through the quaint old cities
of Flanders and Normandy; and, after six months'
journeying from place to place, she returned to Lisle-
wood ; and on the very day after her arrival met Arthur
Walsingham upon the spot where she had parted from
him eight years before.
CHAPTER III.
THE NEW MASTER OF LISLEWOOD PARK.
Six months have passed away since the return of the
Indian officer, and the stormy March winds beat the
branches of the oaks in the stately avenues of Lislewood
Park. A noble and wide domain this heritage of Lisle-
wood. Far away over the Sussex hills stretched the
broad lands which owned the boy-baronet as master :
far away over those bare bleak ridges, that crowned
the barren downs, there was many a snug homestead
and substantial farmhouse in which the rent was put by
after the hay-making, or the harvest, or the pig-killing,
or the sheep-shearing, to be delivered to a stern steward
at the half-year's end for the benefit of Sir Rupert
Lisle, Baronet. You might wander for miles, through
over-shadowed country lanes, and long flat white high
roads ; through woods of low stunted fir-trees; through
tiny villages, lying so hidden under the shadow of the
great hills that you looked down into them from the
high ground as you would have looked into a well ; but
inquire where you would as to the proprietor of the
shady pathway, shut in by hazels and wild roses ; or
the fertile meadows behind the roadside hedges; or the
little row of tumble-down cottages, that looked as if
ready to fall upon the first incautious traveller who
yentured to walk under their sheltering eaves ; inquire

Lady Lisle.
where you would, you were apt to hear the name of
Sir Rupert Lisle. If you stopped for refreshment at
some forgotten-looking village inn, you had only to
glance upwards at the rustic sign, blistering in the hot
summer sun, to see the Lisle Arms, or the Baronet's
Head, or the Sir Rupert Lisle. If you loitered idly,
watching the farmer directing and assisting his men
on the top of a haystack, or at the door of a barn, the
man whom you looked at was, in all probability, a
tenant of Sir Rupert's. The name of Lisle was as old
in the county as the Battle of Hastings itself, for at
that terrible fight, Oscar, Seigneur of Lisle, had led a
company of gallant cross-bowmen against the strength
of Saxon Harold. The pedigree and grants of the
seven-years-old baronet would have stretched the length
of the most spacious chamber in Lislewood House, had
the great rolls of mouldering parchment been unfolded
to their fullest extent. Lislewood Church was filled
with the trophies and the monuments of this ancient
race. Banners taken at Cressy, at Harfleur, and at
Flodden, hung in dingy tatters over recumbent effigies
of knights and soldiers, whose ashes were mouldering
below the chancel.
In the present vestry of the church, which had once
been the chapel of the Lisle family, the curate hung his
surplice over monuments whose carving was of priceless
merit. Look where you would in the old church, the
name of Lisle met you—in quaint Latin scrolls upon
the tablet-covered walls—in faded gilded letters under
the organ presented by the present baronet's grand-
father-in old-fashioned characters above the shelf in
the porch, laden once a week with loaves of bread, the
bequest of the sixth baronet to the poor of Lislewood.
It was strange, after this constant recurrence of the
ancient name, this wide extension of the grandeur and
wealth of the house of Lisle, to come back to Lislewood
Park and find the sole owner of so vast a heritage a
little boy of seven years old, with a pale sickly face and
languid girlish manners, who beguiled the long hours

as best he might, playing drearily by himself in the stiff
Italian flower garden, and tyrannized over by a prag-
matical nurse. Had the captain of the Norman cross-
bows, the haughty oppressor of the Saxon, the victors
of Cressy and Flodden, the noble royalists, who had
fought under Rupert of the Rhine, the gallant gentle-
men who had helped to scatter the foolish friends of
Lucy Waters's handsome son upon Marston Moor ;-
had all these strong and valiant men left only this
feeble fair-haired child to inherit their wealth and
honours ? It seemed almost as if the weight of this
vast inheritage, falling solely upon a helpless orphan,
must surely crush and destroy him. There was some-
thing sinister and unnatural in the child's lonely splen-
dour. No younger brother to claim a portion of his
lands; no designing relations to eat into his fortune;
his mother's wealth to be one day added to all that to
which he had succeeded at his father's death; shut in
from the outer world of his poorer struggling fellow-
creatures, the boy-baronet seemed to languish under a
load of grandeur, and to sicken of a surfeit of pros-
perity.
The March winds blew loud and shrill among the
bare branches of the oaks in Lislewood Park, and Lady
Lisle, now Mrs. Arthur Walsingham, was expected
home from the Continent, whither she had gone after
her marriage with the Indian officer. A dreary morning
in February had seen the village children ranged once
more along the churchyard path. But this time there
were no flowers to strew under the feet of the bride
and bridegroom, for the winter had been an unusually
severe one, and not a snow-drop or a crocus was to be
found in the Lislewood gardens that early February
morning. The cold wind whistled among the sweeping
silken robes of the bride, and lifted the dark hair of
the bridegroom from his uncovered head. The rector's
teeth chattered as he read the solemn service. A sharp
rain pattered against the windows, and was heard
above the monotonous accents of the rector's voice;

Lady Lisle.
and the bride's hand trembled so violently from the
chilly atmosphere of the damp vestry, that she could
scarcely guide the pen with which she signed her name
in the parish register.
There were no guests at this wintry wedding. Lady
Lisle's solicitor gave her away, and no one in the
neighbourhood was invited to take part in the ceremony.
The lady's carriage waited at the churchyard gate to
convey the newly-married couple to a railway station
several miles from Lislewood, whence they were to
go to Dover, and thence on their foreign excursion.
Claribel Lisle seemed ashamed of this marriage with
her old and jilted admirer. She seemed glad to shuffle
over the ceremony, and to run away from the village
in which she was so well known. She fell on her knees
on the cold flag-stones of the vestry when the ceremony
was over, and clasped the little baronet convulsively in
her arms. It was the first time in her life that she had
ever made a public display of any emotion whatever,
and those present stared in amazement at her unwonted
passion.
“Have I acted justly to you, my Rupert,—have I
wronged you, my darling, by this marriage ?" she cried
as she clasped her son to her breast.
The Captain turned his back on the mother and son,
and stared absently out of the vestry window where
the shivering children were waiting to look at the
bride.
“Are you ready, Lady Lisle ?” he said, after a
pause.
She made no reply to him, but, putting the boy
slowly away from her, watched him with a long
earnest lingering gaze, as he left the vestry with his
nurse, to return to Lislewood Park. She heard the
carriage, in which the boy and his nurse had come,
drive off, and then, taking the Captain's arm, she bade
the rector good-bye, and left the church. The village
children observed her pale face and tearful blue eyes,
the long flaxen curls, damp with the winter rain and

disordered by the chilling wind. They could also see
that the dark face of the Indian officer was even paler
than that of his bride, and that his strong hand shook
as he lifted the latch of the little churchyard gate.
The six-weeks' tour was over, and the bride and
bridegroom were hourly expected. Fires blazed in all
the splendid rooms of the mansion of Lislewood. The
house had been refurnished and newly decorated on Sir
Reginald's marriage with the wealthy Claribel Merton.
The old oak-panelling, dating from the reign of an
early Henry, had been repolished and relieved by gilt
mouldings and emblazoned armorial bearings. Ex-
quisitely carved sconces, in gold and bronze, silver and
ebony, ormolu and steel, glittered before oval mirrors
in frames of marvellous workmanship. The great
library, fitted entirely in black oak and gold, had been
lighted by a mullioned window of stained glass. The
frames of all the portraits upon the wide staircases,
which led from either side of the great hall, and met in
a landing-place opening into two galleries running the
entire length of the house, had been regilded, and the
pictures themselves cleaned and restored. The long
drawing-room had been furnished in the modern style.
The hangings of the French windows were of white
watered-silk lined with pale pink and bordered by
delicate rose-tinted fringes; the panelled walls were of
the palest cream-colour; the cornices and mouldings
were rose-colour and gold ; the velvet-pile carpet was
white relieved by scattered groups of half-opened blush-
roses. Claribel's taste had been consulted in the fur.
nishing of this apartment, and every object in the room
was pale and delicate as its fair young mistress. The
tiny tables and fragile étagères were white and gold;
the mirrors were framed with Sèvres biscuit; the
couches and easy-chairs, in every shape and style, were
covered with the same white watered-silk as that em-
ployed for the hangings. All was white and pure and
virginal like the lady of the mansion. If there were

some who thought the room wanting in glow and
colour, so there were some who protested against the
insipid loveliness of its new mistress.
This long drawing-room communicated with a smaller
one, hung with pale apple-green and gold, out of which
a door opened upon a private staircase leading to Lady
Lisle's own apartments, which were separated from the
rest of the house by a short corridor. The dining-
room was furnished with modern-antique carved-oak
cabinets and buffets, dark-green velvet hangings, and
a thick Turkey carpet. The walls, like those of the
staircase and the galleries, were hung with paintings by
the old masters and portraits of the house of Lisle.
The blazing fires reflected upon the walls of the
splendid rooms, the waxen lights glimmering in' the
silver and ormolu sconces, multiplied twentyfold by
the mirrors before which they burned, were lighted in
honour of the return of Mr. and Mrs. Walsingham
from their brief honeymoon tour. The snowy linen and
shining silver, the great silver-gilt tankards and salvers
set forth upon the antique buffet in the dining-room;
the luxurious bedchamber, with its curtains of violet
velvet lined with white satin ; the dressing-room, with
its cheval glasses and priceless china, shut in by double
windows from every breath of the spring breeze; the
thick Axminster carpets; the well-drilled servants, low
of voice, soft of foot, expert of hand, and deferential of
manner; the costly wines, hidden in silver coolers ; the
delicate meats preparing under the hands of the French
cook ;-all this light, luxury, splendour, wealth, and
comfort, had been prepared for the pleasure of the
Indian officer, who had thrown up his captaincy, few
could tell why or wherefore, who was as friendless as
he was poor, whose connections and antecedents were a
mystery even to the woman who had married him; and
who nevertheless had had the good fortune, as the
Lislewood people said, to drop, as if from the skies, into
the very lap of wealth and luxury.
Let us look at the handsome soldier, seated opposite

his wife at the glittering dinner-table. He does not
seem very happy amid all his grandeur. He sits twist-
ing the slender stem of the shallow champagne-glass
round and round in his strong hand, while the bright
bubbles in the sparkling wine melt away one by one.
He has drunk a great deal of Madeira and Moselle, but
the rich wines have not loosened his tongue, or lighted
up his face. He is very much altered since the days in
which he used to sit in the free-seats of Lislewood
Church, staring fiercely at Claribel Merton. It seems
almost as if that fiery, ardent, generous, reckless nature
had burned itself out under the Indian sun, and that
only the ashes remain.
Člaribel has scarcely changed since those foolish
youthful days. Her delicate beauty has lost none of
the purity of its transparent hues. The clear blue eyes
are as bright as they were eight years ago. She is a
little more matronly, and her costly silks and laces
rustle round her, as she walks slowly through the
lighted rooms.
“Claribel,” said the Captain, as they sat by the draw-
ing-room fire, “ Claribel, I am dying of your wealth and
grandeur.”
“ Captain Walsingham !”
“Ah! naturally you don't comprehend me. It is
such a generally understood thing that a poor man
marries a rich woman for the sake of her money, that
I must accept my position, and must not complain of
what far better men have endured before me. But,
Claribel, I tell you I am dying under the load of all
this gaudy splendour. I stifle in these glittering rooms.
I want my barrack and my liberty; my cherry-stemmed
pipe; my kitmutghar, whom I may swear at if I please,
as I dare not at your footmen, who wear the liveries of
my dead rival. I want the pack of cards over which I
have sat till the stars have gone down behind the roofs --
of Calcutta ; my dice-box; anything but this silken and
ormolu gaol. It was in this house I suffered my life's
first fever, Claribel ; and if this room had not been

newly furnished for your marriage, I could snow you the
chair which I took up to hurl at Sir Reginald the night
I heard that you had thrown me over for him.”
“And did you strike him?" asked Mrs. Walsingham,
with a school-girl's curiosity.
“No; men never strike each other in a crowded
drawing-room. There is always some one to say,
• Walsingham, don't be a fool!'or, 'Lisle, what are
you thinking of ?' No; they dragged us asunder, as
you part two boys in a street-fight, and I sent him a
challenge the next morning.”
She took a childish pleasure in hearing the details of
this bygone quarrel. But the Captain could scarcely
speak of the old wounds without having some sense of
the old torture.
“If Reginald Lisle's ghost could wander into this
room, and see me seated by this hearth, Claribel- "
Mrs. Walsingham looked shudderingly back at the
door as her husband spoke, as if she half expected to
see it opened, and the figure of his dead rival standing
pale and ghastly on the threshold.
“Arthur, you and Sir Reginald once were friends.
You will be kind to his son, will you not, for my sake?
His wealth may bring false friends and wicked coun.
sellors about him by-and-by. He has no relations-
the nearest is the man who would inherit his fortune
and his title, should he die childless. I may not live to
see him grow up. He is weak in health, and some
people say, not strong in intellect. It will be in your
power to be either his friend or his enemy. You will
be good to him, Arthur, will you not?”
“As I hope to enjoy your love, yes, Claribel. I am
not a good man, but I will do my duty by your son
Sir Rupert Lisle.”

CHAPTER IV.
AT THE PARK GATES.
GLOOMILY and moodily as Captain Walsingham, late of
the Honourable East India Company's Service, carries
his good fortune, there are still many people in this
obscure Sussex village ready to envy and hate him for
what they call his extraordinary luck. The stalwart
Indian officer troubles himself very little about these
good people, or what they may be pleased to think of
him, but, absorbed in his own thoughts, and apparently
reckless as to the opinions of the outer world, he strolls
in the March sunshine up and down under the over-
arching branches of the leafless trees in the great
avenue, smoking his cheroots, and followed by a huge
black Newfoundland dog. Sometimes he pauses at the
great iron gates which shut the park from the dusty
high road, and looks out through the bars and the
filigree-work into the world beyond. There is some.
thing of the caged lion in the glance of the dark
soldier, as he gazes through the ornamental grating-
something of that far-away restless hopeless look,
which poets tell us they see in the eyes of the eagles
shut up in the four-feet square cages of a zoological
collection.
Does he know that, as he stands there, at the gate of
his step-son's domain, with his hands in the pockets of
his morning coat,- does he know that the eyes of envy
and hatred are upon him, and that if evil wishes could
bring death, he might fall dead on the threshold of
Lislewood Park ?
Behind the diamond panes of one of the little
windows in the Gothic lodge, to the right of the gates,
sits a man of some thirty years of age. Like the
Captain, dark and sallow, with a complexion bronzed
by sun and wind, a tall powerful frame, and strongly-
marked features; but, unlike the Captain, awkward
and slouching of gait, with high shoulders and an

nabitual stoop, with premature wrinkles lurking under
his deep-set eyes, and hard cruel lines about his firmly.
compressed mouth. Like the Captain, lazily smoking
in the morning sun; but, unlike the Captain, looking
across the blue clouds from his long clay pipe, with the
ure of bate and envy and malice, and the suppressed
fury of a tiger that watches its opportunity before it
springs, burning in the sombre depths of his yellow-
green eyes. His name is Gilbert Arnold. Ten years
ago, he was, at twenty years of age, the most desperate
poacher in the county of Sussex. Reclaimed and re-
formed by a model-prison and an evangelical chaplain,
he is to-day a sneak and an idler, living upon his wife,
a hard-working young countrywoman, the keeper of
the principal lodge in Lislewood Park.
Rachel Arnold has had a hard time of it since she
put on a straw bonnet and white ribbons, seven years
ago, to be married to the reformed poacher in Lislewood
Church. She has had to bear with a sulky dissatisfied
man, whose penitence and religion have been alike
excuses for a life of ease and indolence. It is very easy
for the lodge-keeper's idle husband to turn up his
yellow-green eyes in a pious grimace when the hard-
working curate from Lislewood drops in to see how his
protégé is getting on. It is easy enough to spell
through an evangelical tract — and, indeed, Gilbert
Arnold rather likes tracts, for they generally go pretty
hard against the rich, the handsome, the prosperous,
the powerful, and the happy, whom he hates with a
latent fury, which almost touches upon the confines of
· madness. It is easy enough for him to deceive his
good and simple teachers, who wish so earnestly for his
soul's welfare, that they are fain to see in these outward
tokens the visible signs of inward graces. It is easy to
do all this, and at the same time to be envious and
feverishly discontented, idle and extravagant, sulky to his
wife, neglectful of his child, dissatisfied with his station
in life, and malignantly disposed towards his superiors.
It is easy, in short, to seem a very good man after the

simple Lislewood pattern, and to be in reality a very
bad one. The Arnolds have only one child, a sickly
precocious boy, six years old, with light flaxen hair,
and a pale sharp face, resembling his mother, and
entirely unlike his stalwart dark-complexioned father.
“There he is, Rachel,” said Gilbert, looking moodily
at the Captain through the diamond panes of the little
casement.
“Who, Gilbert ?” asked the wife, busy at some
household matters by the little fireplace.
“Our new-master-as I suppose we're to call him,
Captain No-one-knows-who."
“ Captain Walsingham ?”
“ Yes, Captain Walsingham. Isn't it a fine name?
Just for all the world like one out of a playbook, or
one of them three-volume novels my lady's always
reading, and which the curate says is all 'vanity.' The
swindling vagabond, I ain't going to bow and scrape
before him, I can tell him."
“O Gilbert !” Like all old servants, Rachel was a
thorough Conservative; but she was so used to her
husband's tone, as to be very little shocked by it.

he to come here and fatten upon dead Sir Reginald's
property? What right has a penniless rascal like him
to come here and twist himself into the good graces of
that silly widow, whom you call your mistress ? An
idle good-for-nothing scamp like that. What right has
he to come and call himself master of Lislewood Park ?
It was bad enough and hard enough to have to lick Sir
Reginald's shoes, but I'll never stoop down in the dust
to lick his. Though you'd like me to do it-you'd like
me to do it, now, wouldn't you ?” he said, spitefully
addressing himself to the profile of the Captain, who
had just finished his cigar, and was strolling slowly
away through the leafless avenue.
“Why his dog costs more to keep than my boy does,'
resumed Gilbert Arnold, when he had watched the

soldier out of sight. "Look at him,"-he pointed to
his son, sitting at the deal table, eating a basin of
bread-and-milk; “ that there sop's no better than
Master Wolf has for his breakfast every morning. I've
seen them give it him.”
"But they're very good to us, Gilbert."
“O Lord! I know that; I hear it often enough,
They chuck us the victuals that are too bad for the
servants, and too good for the pigs; and they gave you
five shillings to buy Jim there a pair of boots, didn't
they? And at Christmas time they give us a bottle of
wine — rare old wine too, that sends a fire tingling
through every drop of your blood, and makes you feel
as good as them while you're drinking of it. But
what of that? He can drink such wine every day and
every hour, if he pleases. He may wallow in it, if he
likes. He may swim in champagne, or feed his dog off
silver. Look at the little Baronet in his velvet frock,
riding his dapple pony. That pony cost more money
than ever you'll put in the Savings Bank, pinch and
screw and shave as close as you may. And then look
at my son, in his bobnailed boots and huckaback pina-
fore; and yet I know which is the sharpest lad any day
in the week.”
“Yes, our Jimmy's a sharp lad," said the mother,
looking rather anxiously at her boy ; “but he must be
good, and mind what's said to him, and not tease the
pigs or the fowls, for that's cruel.”
“O bother!” said the father, impatiently, “I don't
want him to be a fiddle-faddling girl. Let him tease
the pigs and the fowls, if he likes; I did it when I was
a boy.'
Mr. Gilbert Arnold, loitering about the lodge all day,
with his pipe in his mouth, and his hands in the pockets
of his velveteen jacket, did not quite recommend him-
self as a person whose example it would be well for
youth to follow. Perhaps his wife thought this; for
she sighed plaintively as she went on with her work.
Her husband liked to see ber work, and would often

call her to account for being a slow-coach and a poor
dawdle, as he leaned against the door-post, watching
her movements within the cottage; but he would some
times, on the other hand, laugh bitterly at her for her
industry, and pointing with the stem of his pipe-which,
by the way, was rarely out of his hand-up a long vista
to the stately facade of the mansion, would ask her,
with a sneer, if she thought hard work would ever get
her such a house as yon?
Mr. Gilbert Arnold's capacity for hatred, envy, and
malice was considerably in advance of the generality
• of his species. He hated the East Indian soldier, as
we see; but he had hated dead Sir Reginald quite as
much, though the late Baronet had given the Gothic
lodge and a comfortable weekly income to Mr. Arnold's
wife, and had further looked over and forgiven long
arrears of poaching upon the Lislewood estate. He
hated the fair-haired child, riding by the lodge-door on
his pony. He grudged the poor sickly little Baronet
his fine house, and his splendid rooms and costly fare ;
he would have liked to have dragged the boy out of his
saddle, and tumbled him in the wet clay of the high
road. He was of such stuff as your sans-culotte is
made of, and would have liked to jibe and hoot at a
fallen king and queen, or to ill-use a helpless dauphin.
He would have liked to see the noblest heads in the
land shorn by the ensanguined sickle of the guillotine,
and would have feasted on the horrors of a Reign of
Terror. As it was, he lived within a narrow radius,
and concentrated all his evil feelings on the family he
served. He would loll at his door on moonlit nights,
staring at the windows of the great house, and wishing
that a red glare might suddenly burst out of them,
and forked flames of blue and crimson shoot up to
the quiet sky, till the stately pile fell crashing to the
ground.
“ Other people's houses catch fire," he would mutter
savagely ; “that never does.”
When the small-pox had once raged for a brief period

Lady Lisle.
of terror and distress in the village of Lislewood, the
lodge-keeper had been in unusually good spirits ; but
the horrible pestilence passed away, without having
once shown its hideous visage athwart the stately gates
of Lislewood Park.
“ Other people's only children are taken away from
them,” grumbled Gilbert Arnold; “nothing seems to
hurt hers."
But the young Baronet, though he escaped many of
une scourges common to childhood, through the watch-
ful care of his nurses and his doctors, was by no means
a healthy boy. He was weak and ailing, small for his
age, and very backward with his studies; difficult to
amuse, for he had a dislike to all active exercise, and
very little love for even childish toys and books and
pictures. He would mope about his nursery all day,
and only go out on his pony when compelled to do so.
He was no bigger at seven years of age than Gilbert
Arnold's boy of six, and not nearly so strong. He
showed no great capacity for affection, and his love for
his mother, who idolized him, was of a feeble and ne-
gative order. Perhaps he seemed fonder of the boy at
the lodge than of any one. He would stop his pony
before the little gate if James Arnold was playing in
the garden, and would ask a hundred childish questions
of the boy, while the watchful face of the father, always
lounging in the shadow of the little porch, would peer
stealthily out at the two children with blinking yellow-
green eyes.
It was a noticeable thing, that Gilbert Arnold always
avoided the sunshine. Even in his own cottage he had
somewhat the air of a man who is hiding himself from
some enemy. This lurking manner may have been the
effect of old associations, a habit engendered during his
early career as a poacher, when it had been a common
thing for him to lie for long hours hidden behind a
hedge, or crouching in a dry ditch. He sneaked about
the cottage with a slow cautious step, as if he expected
at every turn to come face-to-face with & gamekeeper

or a constable. He took pride neither in his house nor
his person; he would loll about from year's end to
year's end in the same velveteen jacket, with a broken
horn-button hanging here and there, a wisp of some
coloured woollen stuff twisted like a noose under his
open shirt-collar, a pair of the late Baronet's old tartan
trousers hanging in baggy folds about his legs, and
blucher-boots rusty and down-at-heel upon his awkward
feet. In the course of his morning walks up and down
the avenue, Captain Walsingham came at last to notice
this man, hiding in the shadow of his own doorway,
at the entrance to the park. He sometimes bade
Gilbert good morning, to which the other would reply
with a sulky growl, not at all calculated to encourage
conversation.
The Indian officer grew to feel a strange kind of in-
terest in this man. His gloomy face and furtive manner
inspired Captain Walsingham with some feeling of
curiosity as to his past life, and the new master of
Lislewood took the trouble to make some inquiries
about the sulky lodge-keeper.
“A reformed poacher,” he said, thoughtfully, when
one of the servants at the house had told him the man's
history. “An old gaol-bird, an idle hulking hypocrite,
living upon his silly hard-working wife. Ah! I thought
80."
From this very time the ill-mannered lodge-keeper
seemed to possess some strange fascination for the dash-
ing Captain. He would enter into conversation with
him, much against Gilbert Arnold's will, who seemed
scarcely to speak of his own volition, but rather to
suffer his words to be dragged out of him one by one
by his interlocutor.
The Captain asked him questions about his old life-
whether he was not happier in the riotous poaching
days, happier even in the county gaol, than he was now.
But Gilbert Arnold was too accomplished a hypocrite to
answer these questions otherwise than by sanctimonious
protestations of his past wickedness and his present

penitence, liberally interlarded by quotations from the
curate's tracts.
But neither sulkiness nor hypocrisy had power to
repel this eccentric interest which the ci-devant poacher
had aroused in Captain Walsingham, and the officer
rarely came to the park gates now without stopping to
talk to Mr. Arnold across the low garden hedge which
surrounded the Gothic lodge. The yellow-green eyes
of the poacher, glittering with a sinister light in the
shadow of the porch, seemed to fascinate him, and hold
him by their influence, as a bird is held by the gaze of a
crouching cat.
“That's the sort of man to come behind one at mid-
night in a dark lane with a bludgeon or a pitch-plaster,"
muttered the Captain, as he walked away from the gates
after one of these interviews. “He has done bad things
in his youth, and he hates himself so much, that he hates
everybody else for not being like himself. A dangerous,
treacherous, sneaking, cold blooded coward, I'll be
sworn; and yet, for all that, I like to look at him."
CHAPTER V.
MAJOR AND MRS. GRANVILLE VARNEY.
THE oaks were full in leaf in the avenues of Lislewood
Park, and Arthur Walsingham had been six months
married to his old love. They sat at breakfast in the
library, at a little table wheeled close to the painted
window ; the light streaming through the open lattices,
tinged the snowy table-cloth and Mrs. Walsingham's
pure white muslin dress with rainbow splendour. The
room was all a-blaze with the August sunshine, and Sir
Rupert Lisle could scarcely bear its blinding dazzle in
his light blue eyes. The small round table with its
perfect breakfast equipage might have made a subject
for a painter of still-life. Hothouse plums and grapes
nestled among clustering vine-leaves in imitation rustio

baskets of Sèvres china; golden-tinted apricots and
purple mulberries made a glowing mixture of colour
against the rich brown background of a raised pie;
and a rare old tea-and-coffee service, fashioned by Queen
Anne's own silversmith, glittered and flashed in the sun-
light. The scent of a thousand roses blew in at the
open window; the murmur of a fall of water in the
lake, the hum of bees in the garden, the voices of my-
riad birds, the plaintive lowing of cattle away in the
distant meadows, and the loud purring of a Persian cat
basking in the broad window-sill, all mixed themselves
into one low summer sound of rustic happiness.
“ Claribel,” said the Captain, “I don't think we have
had a more glorious day than this through all the sum-
mer. We must enjoy ourselves to-day. I will take
Rupert and you for a long drive. Will you go, Baronet?”
The Captain was very fond of calling his little step-son
by his title. There was something eccentric in the
contrast of the dignified appellation with the pale-faced
little owner of it. “Will you go, Baronet, for a long
drive under the hills, past Beecher's Ride, into the pretty
villages on the London road, where the poor little
children come out to look at your phaeton and high-
bred horses and liveried grooms, eh, Baronet ?”
“ Yes, please, papa.”
“ Shall you like a drive to-day, Claribel ? "
“ If you please, dear Arthur,” said his wife, peeling a
peach, and never looking up from her occupation.
During this conversation a servant entered the room
and laid the morning papers by Captain Walsingham's
plate.
“Ah! the Times, Morning Post. Heaven bless these
railways, which bring us the London papers at ten
o'clock! Brighton Gazette ; " the Captain unfolded the
provincial paper. They were only ten miles from
Brighton at Lislewood Park.
"The Lances, my father's cousins, always go to Brigh.
ton in August. Look for their names, Arthur," said
Mrs. Walsingham.
plato Ah ! thehich bringette;"

Lady Lislo.
“Where shall I look ?"
“ In the list of visitors: there is always a visitors'
list in those papers. They stop at the Albion."
“Good ! we shall soon see.”
Was the August sun so strong in the Captain's eyes
that it dazzled his sight and made him reel like a
dranken man, as he staggered up out of his chair and
went nearer to the open window ? Did the summer
breeze shake the newspaper, or was it the strong hand
of the soldier that shivered like a leaf beaten by furious
winds ? What was it—what could it be—what did it
mean?
“ Arthur! are you ill? You are as white as death!”
cried Claribel Walsingham.
The Captain crushed the Brighton Gazette in his
broad hand, and stood silently staring out of the win.
dow for some moments before he replied to his wife's
question. But when he did answer her, it was in his
most commonplace tone :-
“ Lance, I think you said the name was. No, they
are not there."
“But, Arthur, what was it that ailed you when you
sprang up from the table like that?”
“Oh, nothing; a sort of vertigo-a sudden dizziness
caused by the heat.”
“How you startled me, Captain Walsingham! I
really sometimes think you are a little mad!”
“My dear Claribel, I really sometimes think so
too."
“But give me the Gazette. Let me see if I cannot
find the Lance's names.”
Her husband handed her the crumpled ball of paper,
and, throwing himself into his chair, sat staring
vacantly at the arabesques on the velvet pile.
Mrs. Walsingham looked carefully through a list of
names.
“No," she said, “they are evidently not there.
Brighton seems to be very empty. There are no new
arrivals at the Albion, except two or three single men,

and a Major and Mrs. Granville Varney. What a
pretty name! Isn't it, Arthur?”.
“Which ?” he said, absently, without looking at
her.
“Granville Varney."
“O isn't it? A sweet pretty name. He's in the
Company's service, the Major.
“Do you know him ?”
* Intimately. He was in my own regiment. I'll go
and order the phaeton. Put on your bonnet, Claribel ;
I'll drive you to Markham Wood. I've a proposition
to make to you while we're out."
" A proposition ?"
“ Yes; or say, rather, I've a favour to ask of you.
There, go and put on your bonnet, like a good tract-
able undemonstrative child; and you, Ruperto, run
for your hat. I'm going to the stables."
The Captain strode out of the room with his swing-
ing cavalry-officer step; but when he got into the hall,
he asked a servant for a glass of water, and drank it at
a draught. The man looked almost frightened as he
stared at Captain Walsiugham's ghastly face.
“Shall I bring you some brandy, sir?” he asked
anxiously.
“Do, Richard. I'll go into the butler's pantry. You
can get me some there."
Seated in the midst of a bright array of glass and
silver, Captain Walsingham, late of the Honourable
East India Company's service, quietly fainted away,
with his head upon the under-butler's shoulder. They
forced the rim of a tumbler between his chattering
teeth, and poured half that vessel full of pale French
brandy down his throat, and they were just about to
summon Mrs. Walsingham, when the soldier opened his
eyes, and looking slowly round him, said,
“For Heaven's sake, not a word of this to your mis.
tress. I was subject to it in India. We soldiers lead
rather a rackety life out there, and come home with
shaken constitutions and the nerves of a boarding-

schvol miss. Jervis, tell them I want the mail-phaeton
immediately.”
He left the room before they could answer him, and,
returning to the library, picked up the newspaper, which
had fallen to the ground.
“Major and Mrs. Granville Varney," he read, slowly
and distinctly, “only ten miles from this place. They
will hear of me; they will scent me out; they will
harass, betray, goad, hurniliate, torture, madden, and
destroy me. They will dun me for their diabolical bar-
gain; they will sue me for the last quarter of an ounce
of the promised pound of flesh. Fool! fool! fool! to
think that even in the remotest corner of the earth a
man could hide himself from the past. I am like that
poacher fellow at the gate," he said, as he walked
rapidly up and down the room, “hiding, hiding-sneak-
ing into every corner, crouching under every shadow,
but never hidden. What a stamp we all bear!” he
cried, with a hoarse laugh; "and how you may know us,
every one, by the taint that's upon us! I can see my
likeness in that man plainer than I can see it in a glass.
I can see myself in him smoking, idling, lounging,
hiding. But what if I sell them yet? What if I
throw them off the scent, by a clever wind in the
course ? By Heaven, I could do it, if she'll only help
me!”
His wife, leading her son by the hand, came into the
room as he said the words. She looked very fair and
girlish and innocent, in a simple summer bonnet and
diaphanous shawl of lace and muslin.
« Claribel,” said the Captain, when they had taken
their seats in their high phaeton, with a couple of
grooms behind them, and the spirited horses were
champing and pawing with impatience, “ Claribel, you
look so pretty to-day, that I don't think you'll be able
to say no, if I ask you to do me a favour."
“Well, Arthur, ask me, then,” she said, laughiny.
“I want you to spend this autumn abroad,” he said,
looking at her rather anxiously as he spoke.

the Captamans thorouterna
“ Abroad—I should like that very much. Will you
take me to Paris ? "
“Further than Paris,” said the Captain.
“ Further than Paris ? Italy ? Germany ?"
“Neither. I should like to take you a thorough
artist's tour, Claribel, though I am no painter. I should
like to take you through a wilderness. I should like to
take you to the Pillars of Hercules. Will you go ?”
“ But,” she remonstrated,“ nobody goes there."
“And for that very reason, Claribel, it will be the
place of all others for us. We don't want to go to
Baden Baden to see London shopkeepers ruin them-
selves at rouge et noir; or to Naples or Florence, to
hear supercilious tourists talk Murray's Handbook.
No, Claribel, I want to take you away from the world.
Will you go? If you have ever loved me, say “yes,'”
he added, with feverish energy—“say 'yes,' my darling,
and let ine fly out of this pest-smitten land.”
We have said already that there was always some-
thing of fear in Claribel's manner to the Indian officer.
She assented now, very much as she had assented to his
prayer upon the summit of Beecher's Ride-she con.
sented as if she dared not refuse.
“Yes, Arthur, we will go if you like. But really,
you must be a little mad "
“I told you before, there is scarcely any doubt upon
that point. But you are a darling girl, and you have
made me the happiest of men ; light my cigar for me,
and you shall see how I'll turn the corner into the cross-
road to the wood."
The Baronet's wealthy widow was the most submis-
sive of wives to the penniless soldier; she allowed him
to smoke his cheroots in her white and rose-tinted
drawing-room; she lit them for him when he was
driving, and would even put them into his moustached
mouth. If it was in her power to love any one besides
her son, Sir Rupert Lisle, she certainly loved this hand-
some dashing mad-brained soldier, who had wooed her
so daringly in the days gone by. But she was never-

theless terribly frightened by his fits of moody silence,
and would sit for hours watching every change in his
dark face, as he lay on one of her sofas smoking his
incessant cheroots, and gnawing and twisting the ends
of his black moustache, in some gloomy unfathomable
reverie. But on this bright August day the Captain
bade adieu to gloom and reverie, and abandoned him.
self to almost boyish gaiety. In the depths of a thick
wood the little party alighted, and one of the grooms
took a tiny hamper from the back of the carriage-a
delightful little hamper, from which the Captain ex-
tracted a tongue, a pair of chickens, a basket of apri-
cots, and a couple of bottles of sparkling hock.
Claribel and the boy were delighted with this im-
promptu luncheon. The Captain spread the rustic feast
with his own hands, upon a table-cloth which he laid
on the thick moss at the foot of an old tree. He sat
astride one of the gnarled roots, with a smile on his
lips, smoking his cigar, and watching the mother and
son seated side by side before the little banquet.
“How pretty you look, my Claribel! Put those oak-
leaves in your mother's hair, Sir Rupert. No, no; not
that way, twist them into a garland, Baronet. Now,
my yellow-haired darling, you look like tutelar goddess
of the place. What a happy man I ought to be, Claribel,
with a rich wife, whose curls are the colour of the amber
mouthpieces of my meerschaum, and who will consent
to go in search of the Pillars of Hercules with her pen-
niless husband! You bought me, Mrs. Walsingham,
just as Sir Reginald Lisle bought you. It's only retri-
bution, after all; la loi du talion, as our neighbours call
it. You pay for my coats and my cheroots, the wine I
drink and the servants who wait upon me; and now
you are going to pay my travelling expenses in my
flight from the blue devils. That is what the world
would say, Claribel, about you and me. And yet,
Heaven knows, I love you, my darling, as dearly and
as honestly as ever King Cophetua loved the beggar
girl he elevated to his throne ; and if all this wealth

and splendour were to melt away for ever, I doubt if I
should not be the happier for its loss."
It was six o'clock in the afternoon before they drove
homewards. Rachel Arnold opened the gates, with her
fair-haired boy clinging to the skirts of her gown, and
looking up inquisitively at the other fair-haired boy
perched between the Captain and his wife in the front
seat of the phaeton. It was an envious glance ; for
already Master Arnold had acquired some of his father's
propensities, and thought it a very hard thing that this
other boy should wear a velvet tunic and a plume of
feathers, and ride in a splendid carriage, while he had
no better garment than a patched and faded frock that
had once belonged to the Baronet, and no chance of a
ride in any finer vehicle than a cart borrowed from the
stables by his father.
Gilbert leaned over his garden-gate, smoking a dirty
clay pipe, and scarcely looked up, to touch his ragged
fustian cap, as the carriage dashed past the lodge.
Slovenly and unshaven, with straggling dark hair and
blinking cat-like eyes, he threw the shadow of his
skulking figure across the road, so directly under
the feet of the horses, that, as they galloped through
it, they seemed almost to be running over the man
himself.
The Captain and his wife had talked over their pro-
mised tour all the afternoon. They were to go at once.
His impatience knew no bounds. He would have left
Sussex that night, if it had been possible. The boy
was to go with them, and two of the servants. A
courier was to be engaged in London; not a moment
was to be wasted in delay or elaborate preparation.
They were to cross over to France, and there make
fuller arrangements as to the way they were to go : but
in any case they were to leave England immediately.
“How pretty the house looks to-day, Arthur!” said
Mrs. Walsingham, as her husband handed her out of
the phaeton, and they passed together through a vesti.
bule filled with hothouse flowers, and separated by s

glass door from the hall. “I wish you were better
satisfied with your English life.”
“I wish I could be, Claribel. Yes, it is pretty. I
must have the spirit of Cain to run away from such a
paradise.”
They were standing in the hall by this time; a ser.
vant came forward with a silver salver, upon which lay
two very thin glazed cards—a lady's and a gentleman's.
“What is this?” said the Captain, indifferently.
“Put them in Mrs. Walsingham's card-basket, Jervis.”
“But the lady and gentleman are here, sir. They
said they would wait till you returned, and they are
looking at the pictures in the dining-room."
“Looking at the pictures !” The Captain took off
his hat, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead
with his handkerchief. “ Who are these people, Clari.
bel ?” he asked, as his wife looked at the cards.
“Why, Arthur, nothing ever was so strange, I think;
they are the very people whose names we saw this
morning in the Brighton paper. Your Indian friends,
Major and Mrs. Granville Varney."
At this very moment the oak door of the dining-room
was opened from within, and a smiling face peeped out
into the hall.
“And it is the dear child himself !” cried the owner,
in hearty and delighted accents. “My dear Arthur, I
have found you at last, then! You sly old fox! I
suppose you never expected to see your old chum again
-and you tried to cut your devoted Granville, eh?
But, you see, I've hunted you down-eh, dear boy ? eh,
sly old fox ? eh, dear child ?”
And Major Granville Varney burst into a long musical
peal of the merriest laughter that ever, perhaps, was
heard to issue from human lungs. He came out into
the hall, and shook hands with his dear child, and his
sly old fox, and his dear boy, ever so many times over,
with both hands at once. There was no mistake about
the delight he felt in the meeting ; he laughed, he
chuckled, he repeated himself over and over again is

an almost imbecile manner, from very buoyancy of
spirits. He was tall and stout, fresh-looking and rosy.
He had blue eyes, that flashed and glittered when he
smiled, and the lids of which opened and shut so often
that his auburn eyelashes seemed to emit transient
flashes of light in the sunshine. His teeth were so white
that they glittered almost as much as his eyes; his lips
were as rosy and his complexion as fair as a woman's;
his pale auburn moustache, exquisitely trained, and the
forest of bright curls clustering round his white fore-
head, were shot with golden hues; and the amber-
tinted eyebrows and eyelashes and ringlets and whiskers
and moustache made his face grem all gold and glitter,
so that you could scarcely look at him long without
having your eyes dazzled almost as painfully as if you
had looked at the reflection of the sun upon a burning.
glass. This golden-hai ed Major was dressed in a loose
careless style, which became him wonderfully, though
it was a costume n which very few modern gentlemen
would have cared to exhibit themseives. He wore a
bright-coloured handkerchief round his throat, a braided
velvet coat, a Irmon-c loured waistcoat, and a quantity
of golden ornar..ents, hat shivered and scintillated at
his watchchain. His hands glittered with rings. From
head to foot he was all flash, glitter, and dazzle ; and
wherever he went he seemed to shed twinkling rays of
golden light about and around him.
The sly old fox, pale and gloomy, gave his friend a
sulky welcome to Lislewood Park, and introduced him
to his wife.
The Major was delighted. “I had never heard of
this naughty boy's marriage. Would you believe it,
Mrs. Walsingham,” he said ; "the dear child kept it
dark even from his friends in Calcutta; his friends who
loved him so dearly, and had a hundred odd little claims
upon his affection, and I only heard of the happy event
accidentally this very morning at the Albion Hotel,
Brighton. Shall I tell you how it was, my dear Arthur

nothing to be seen anywhere within a drive of Brighton
which we had not already seen. Mrs. Varney still in-
sisting, I inquired of the waiter as to the gentlemen's
seats in the neighbourhood; were there any pictures or
gardens or old tapestry or ruins, or anything in that way
for idle people to see? Waiter suggested Lislewood
Park; at Lislewood Park there were pictures and gardens
and tapestry; and the waiter had no doubt that we should
be allowed to see them on presentation of our cards.
Good! Which Lislewood Park? Why the mansion of
Sir Rupert Lisle, Baronet. Good! we would drive to
Lislewood Park, and look at Sir Rupert Lisle, Baronet.
Never for a moment imagining,” said the Major, bowing
and smiling at the little boy, “ that Sir Rupert Lisle,
Baronet, was a young gentleman in a velvet tunic.
Well, arrived here, we request to see the house. We
are told that it is never shown. "What !' we exclaim,
mournfully, 'never?' 'Never,' reply the servants ;
• Captain Walsingham has a particular objection to it.'
Captain Walsingham !' imagine my surprise, dear boy;
for, if you remember, when you left Calcutta, you did
not seem the most likely person to become master of
such a place as Lislewood Park. Picture my delight,
then! Imagine the felicity I derive from the discovery
of my friend's felicity, and shake hands once more, sly
old fox!”
“Don't be a fool, Major !” muttered the sly old fox,
in reply to this affectionate address.
"And the dear child has never once asked after our
poor Ada, who is yawning at Sir Rupert Lisle's Rubens
over the mantelpiece yonder,” said the Major, pointing
to the half-open drawing-room door, “which, between
you and me and Mrs. Walsingham (and with no dis-
respect to the Baronet, who is too young to be a very
severe critic), is neither more nor less than a copy!
Yes," said the Major, looking at Arthur Walsingham;
“yes, Arthur, dear child, a copy ; and I think I could
put my hand upon the grandson of the man who did it;
a little fellow at Antwerp, a Jew, Mrs. Walsingham, and

& genius. The Rubens colouring is hereditary in the
family, and any clever picture-dealer will tell you where
any of the lot have been at work.”
The Captain, who was looking gloomily down at his
dusty boots, appeared to take no interest whatever in
the artistic capabilities of the Antwerp Jews.
Major Varney looked round, with a glittering, spark-
ling, scintillating smile, as if waiting for some one to
say something good. The Captain never raised his eyes
from his boots.
" Arthur," said his senior officer, pulling with one
fair ringed hand at his yellow moustache, “my fox, you
receive me as if I were a bailiff. And poor Ada, surely
you are going to ask after her!”.
“Ah, ah, yes !” answered the Captain. “How is
Mrs. Varney ?”
“Mrs. Varney!” exclaimed the Major, with reproach-
ful melancholy. “And two years ago, my dear Mrs.
Walsingham it used to be Arthur and Ada always with
these dear children. But come here, surly Captain,
then, and see your old friend. Mrs. Walsingham my
wife will be delighted with you, and you will be
delighted with my wife. Both young, both eminently
lovely," he added, bowing to Claribel. “One all
animation, the other all repose. Ada,” he called,
raising his voice.
“Yes, dear.”
Only two syllables, certainly; but tones of liquid
magic, that vibrated through your very heart of hearts.
It was a voice that seemed painfully beautiful. After
those two melodious syllables there was a brief silence,
followed by a silken rustling, and then Mrs. Major Varney
appeared at the drawing-room door, and stood upon the
threshold, like a picture in a frame.
A green velvet curtain, hanging on one side of the
doorway, assisted the illusion. The light descended
from the great window in the hall, and the woman
standing in the doorway was so lovely, that the sunshine
seemed to concentrate itself about her, leaving the rest

of the hall in shadow, till even the Major ceased glit-
tering. She was richly dressed in brocaded silk, of
shining silver grey, with fringes and ribbons of a deep
glowing violet colour. An immense shawl, of thick
black lace, fell about her, not as a shawl, but as a drapery,
hanging loosely from one shoulder, and trailing in
artistic folds over the skirt of her dress. She had
thrown off her bonnet, and her dark-brown hair fell
carelessly about her shoulders. It was not fastened or
dressed, like anybody else's hair, but seemed to be
thrown back from her low forehead, to fall, in clusters of
ringlets, where and how it chose. Her face was per-
fectly oriental ; the nose small and aquiline; her eyes
black as night, almond-shaped, languid, half-veiled by
long dark lashes ; her pouting lips a vivid crimson ; her
complexion a pale olive. But to this glorious splendour
of feature and of colouring she added the still more
winning loveliness of an exquisitely childlike counte-
nance. Her enemies, powerless to deny her attractions,
declared that she was a Jewess. It was all they could
find to say. She stood for a few moments in the same
attitude, motionless as a statue. She seemed as if she
had become accustomed to wait instinctively till the
surprise and admiration elicited by her appearance had
subsided. Then, holding out a small exquisitely-gloved
hand, she approached the Captain, who had looked at
her as if he too beheld her for the first time.
“Captain Walsingham, have you quite forgotten
Calcutta ?”
“Forgotten Calcutta ? I'll wager not indeed !” said
the Major, with a peal of ringing laughter.
“Not in the least, Mrs. Varney. Experience is
an expensive teacher at the best of times; but it
would be a bad one, indeed, if we forgot its lessons so
soon.”
“He talks,” said the Major, still laughing, “like the
moral at the end of the last chapter in a novel written
with a purpose. Sly fox! he has ranged himself, as
our friends on the other side of the Channel say. But

come, Arthur, Arthur, make the ladies acquainted with
each other."
The bronzed face of the Captain took a more sombra
hue than usual.
“It is scarcely worth while,” he said ; “my wife and
I start for the Continent to-morrow. The ladies would
have no time to become intimate. Come, Claribel-
come, Baronet.” He took the boy by the hand and
walked towards the door of the library, turning his
back deliberately to the Major and his beautiful wife.
Mrs. Walsingham stared in amazement at her husband.
She had seen him abrupt and strange in his manners,
but she had never before seen him like this. The
Major did not appear in the least annoyed; he laughed
softly to himself, and before Captain Walsingham could
leave the hall, he had begun to sing, in a very fine
tenor voice, the first lines of one of Moore's melodies-
“Fly not yet, 'tis just the hour.”
Arthur Walsingham stopped as suddenly as if he had
been shot.
“ Think better of it, dear boy,” said the Major, when
he had finished the verse, and executed a very artistic
little embellishment upon the last note but one; “ think
better of it, my child, and introduce Mrs. Walsingham
to Mrs. Varney. Introduce them, Arthur, and change
you mind about the continental trip. I really think
you'd better.”
The Captain introduced his wife and Mrs. Varney
to each other. Claribel seemed very well disposed
towards the beautiful stranger. “Won't you ask your
friends to dinner, Arthur?” she whispered to her
husband. He did not answer her. " Take Mrs.
Varney into the drawing-room, Claribel,” he said ;
“and you, Major, come and have a cigar upon the
terrace.”
“A dozen, my dear boy, if you please. You and I
have so much to say to each other."
The two men paced and down the long promenade

until the dinner-bell rang from the cupola over the
hall. The ladies, seated near one of the drawing-room
windows, saw that they were deep in conversation. The
Major was very animated, and indulged in a good deal
of illustrative action as he talked. Captain Walsingham
walked with his head bent and his hands in his pockets;
and it was to be noticed that when the Major was most
radiant and animated, when he gesticulated most and
laughed loudest, his companion smoked more fiercely
than usual, and seemed as if he would fain have con-
sumed his cheroot in half-a-dozen savage puffs. A few
minutes after the bell had ceased ringing, Captain
Walsingham came in at the drawing-room window,
followed by his friend.
“Claribel,” he said, “Major Varney has persuaded
me to postpone our tour till he and his wife can join
us in it; in the meantime he has promised to enliven
us here by a visit of a week or two."
“Dear Arthur has been so eloquent in his hospitable
entreaties, Ada, that, without consulting either your
wishes or Mrs. Walsingham-who, by the way, may
think these Indian friendships a terrible nuisance-I
have consented to stay for a few days,” said the Major.
“But I have my own carriage with me, Arthur, --will
that inconvenience you?”
“No; there is plenty of room in the stables. You
have your own coachman, then ?”
“ Yes; an excellent fellow; he will be an acquisition
to your servants' hall.”
« The Major and Mrs. Varney will have the blue
rooms, Claribel. Will you give Carson her orders ?”
“Yes, Arthur, immediately. I am so glad you are
going to stay with us,” added Mrs. Walsingham, turning
to Ada Varney.
“You like her?” said the Major. “I thought you
would; everybody does.”
They were all leaving the room, when Major Granville
Varney stopped at the door, and, looking round upon
the luxurious apartment, opening upon the wide ex.

panse of garden, lake, and woodland, he said delibe-
rately, “ So this is Lislewood Park! Arthur Walsingham,
you are a slyer fox than your superior officer.”

redoubled radiance upon the little party at the dining-
table. He was seated next to Claribel Walsingham,
and the languid mistress of Lislewood Park found her.
self listening with unwonted interest to the incessant
rattle of the golden-haired officer. He told her a hun
dred anecdotes of Indian life-anecdotes so briefly told,
so neat and epigrammatic, that they too seemed to have
a sparkle of their own, and to be as bright and glittering
as the Major himself.
Like all very quiet and undemonstrative people,
Claribel was always fascinated by animation in others.
She listened to and wondered at this light-hearted
soldier, who told her almost in the same breath of
some desperate struggle in the Punjaub, and of a ludi.
crous scene at a dinner in Calcutta. She sighed as
she looked from the accomplished Major to the silent
Captain, who bent gloomily over his plate, and stared
absently at the Lisle crest upon his fork. “If Arthur
had only been blessed with such spirits !” she thought.
Mrs. Varney said very little. She had heard all the
Major's stories before, perhaps. Captain Walsingham
did not make any attempt to get up a conversation with
his fair neighbour, but leant back in his chair, moody,
silent, and absent of manner, with his glass of claret
untouched before him, while his visitor descanted on
the excellence of the wine, and the perfection of the
hothouse peaches.

the drawing-room, and the Vaior was giving Mrs.

Walsingham a topographical description of the City of
Palaces, the Captain strode out of the open window,
down the terrace steps, through the garden, and into
the long avenue leading to the gates. The sun had set
in a leaden sky, leaving behind him lurid streaks
of fiery light that were slowly fading out amongst
the trunks of the great trees. The heat was oppres-
sive, and the heavy atmosphere had that sinister
stillness which presages a storm. Large drops of rain
pattered upon the leaves of the oaks, and now and
then upon the Captain's uncovered head; but he
never once looked up, or seemed to be aware of the
shower.
“It is as lonely as one of the primeval forests," he
said, looking about him, and turning from the avenue
into the thickly-wooded part of the park.
After walking for some time, he reached a spot
where the great branches of the beeches made a dense
roof over his head. He had looked every now and
then back to the lighted windows of the house, shining
on the other side of the lake, and reflected in the still
water ; but looking back now he found that it was out
of sight. So completely was it shut in by the magni-
ficent old timber.
“Midway between the house and the gates,” he said,
“and far from either. No one but a poacher or a
suicide would ever come here."
He stopped under one of the trees, and seating him-
self upon a branch that grew a few feet from the
ground, took something from the pocket of his dress-
coat. The something was wrapped in a cambric hand-
kerchief. He examined it carefully by the touch-it
was too dark for him to see and as he held it in his
hands, it clicked sharply. At the sound of this click,
a white object flew over the Captain's shoulder like the
wing of a bird, and the something was snatched from
his hand. He sprang to his feet, and, turning round,
caught a man, who had been standing behind him, by
the throat.

“Give it me back!” he said fiercely to the intruder,
who was no other than his friend, Major Granville
Varney.
“On no account, my dear boy ; on no account. Have
you another of them ? '
“What's that to you?”
“ Silly child! Have you another pistol ; yes or no ?”
said the Major, in his most agreeable tones.
"No."
“Good, my Arthur. Then let us sit down together
upon this beech, which makes an excellent causeuse by
the way, and talk this business over quietly.".
Captain Walsingham seated himself opposite the
Major without uttering a word.
"In the first place, we will draw the charge from
this absurd little plaything," said Major Varney, putting
the ball into his pocket, and scattering the powder on
the ground, “and then we will light our cigars, and
proceed to business.” He handed Arthur Walsingham
à cigar-case and a fusee-box. The fusees threw a brief
red glare upon the faces of the two men, as they lighted
their cigars. The Captain's was as white as a corpse ;
the Major's serene and smiling.
“And now, dear Arthur, what is the meaning of
this?"
“What is the meaning of which ? " muttered the
Captain.
"The loaded pistol! Foolish boy! do you suppose I
didn't know what you were after? Do you think I
couldn't see ? Pshaw! I read it in your face at the
dinner-table. I heard the pistol chink against the
framework of your chair, as you rose to open the door
for the ladies. When you went out of the drawing-
room, I knew what you were going to do, and five
minutes afterwards followed you myself. There is gene-
rally a little hesitation-a trifling delay in these matters,
however anxious a man may be to put an end to him-
self and his embarrassments at the same moment; so I
was not afraid of being too late. Foolish boy! deluded

boy ! false to his own interests, and ungrateful to his
friends. Sad boy!”
The Major's cheery laugh rang through the dark
arcades, as he dropped the pistol into his coat-pocket,
and took a few puffs at his cigar. The red end of
Captain Walsingham's cheroot burned with a steady
fire. The smoker was seated in a crouching attitude,
huddled against the trunk of the tree. The senior
officer sat at the extremity of the arm of the beech,
nursing one varnished boot upon his knee.
“Now, Arthur, were I a disagreeable fellow, I might
commence this conversation by reproaching you with
your ingratitude ; but I hate reproaches, so I pass that
over, and come at once to your impolicy. Arthur,
you've made a fool of yourself.”
The Captain did not reply to this observation. After
& pause, the Major continued :-
" You are sulky, Arthur, or you would say, 'How
so ?' But no matter, I put the question for you, prior
to answering it. I place myself in the position of you,
Arthur Walsingham, and I ask, How have I, the said
Arthur, made a fool of myself? In the first place, my
dear boy, you have made the very terrible, but ex-
tremely common, mistake of believing it possible to
profit by the services of a much cleverer man than
yourself, so long as those services were necessary
to you, and to throw over that much cleverer man
than yourself as soon as you could dispense with his
aid.”
The patter of the falling rain was still the only
sound that answered Major Granville Varney.
"Some years ago, Arthur, you were in such a
hobble, that, but for the assistance of a kind friend,
it's exceedingly unlikely you would have ever got out
of it.”
“Granted,” said the Captain.
“Dear boy, if you will only show an amiable and
conciliating spirit, we shall get on as well as ever.
Well the friend did help you, and by his aid you were

59
extricated from the hobble. As might be reasonably
expected, a very lively attachment sprang up between
you and the friend in question. People in Calcutta
began to talk about Damon and Pythias. It was
something more than friendship. It was a mysterious
and masonic fellowship, which nothing but death could
destroy. Was it not, dear Arthur?"
“ If you ask me whether we were useful to each
other,-I shall say yes,” answered the Captain.
“But you'll not say any more. Unromantic Arthur!
Well, then, we were useful to each other—eminently
useful—and we might have continued to be so for many
prosperous years. When, behold, one morning, without
either rhyme or reason, Captain Arthur Walsingham
walks out of the East India Company's service as
coolly as be would have walked out of a club-house ;
instead of consulting his devoted friend, who would
have advised him to wait quietly, until he was bought
out by his juniors.”
“ Perhaps you'd have had him wait quietly until he
was told he had better leave the service. Eh, Major ?"
said the Captain, with a sneering laugh.
“ Arthur, you're a fool! Well, instead of seeking
counsel from a superior mind, forgetful of all past
favours, ungrateful, secret, and unconfiding, this foolish
boy walks out of the service and on board a ship bound
for England. This is all his devoted friend can learn
about him, when on returning from an excursion to the
hills he finds that this foolish Captain has departed.”
“ Yes. You had lost your tool, Major."
“I had lost my tool, Arthur ? How can you put
matters upon so unfriendly a footing ?” said the Major,
in tones of manly indignation. “I had lost my friend.
my pupil, my companion, my Damon. I caused inquiries
to be made through a friend in England. You had been
seen to land at Dover, but you had never been seen
afterwards; in short, there was nothing to be done but
to submit- to bide my time. The sly fox has given
me the slip,' I said ; 'but I'll bide my time, and early or

late, so sure as my name is Granville Varney, I'll hunt
him down !'"
He laid his two effeminate white hands lightly upon
the Captain's shoulders as he spoke. Light as the touch
was, Arthur Walsingham crouched down under it, as
he might have done under the pressure of a Hercules.
"I'll hunt him down,' I said,” continued the Major;
“hide where he will, wind when and how he will and
as often as he will, I'll scent him out, I'll track him
home, I'll hunt him down !' And I've done it." He
laughed loudly and triumphantly, rubbed his hands
softly together, and looked askance through the dark.
ness, with his glittering blue eyes fixed on the dim out-
line of the Captain's face.
“I obtained leave of absence and I left India,” he
continued, speaking rapidly, and working up to a climax.
" I have been in every gambling-house in London ; in
every billiard-room in every town in England; I have
made my inquiries at every place, and of every person,
likely or unlikely; and, after indefatigable research,
after a thousand mortifications, a thousand defeats, I
hear at last, this morning at the Albion Hotel, Brighton,
that a certain Captain Walsingham has married the rich
widow of Sir Reginald Lisle, Baronet, and has taken up
bis quarters at Lislewood Park."
“ Your visit was not accidental, then ?” asked the
Captain.
“My dear Arthur, do you think that if I ever left the
course of my life to be directed by accident, I should be
the man I am ? No, I knew where I was coming and
why I was coming; and now you may know it too. I
come to claim the fulfilment of the terms of our old
treaty. I come to claim my share in your winnings,
according to the old bargain. I come to exact my rights
established by precedent long ago. Whatever amount
of your wife's fortune may fall into your hands, I claim
the half of that amount. Whatever of your step-son's
wealth and power can be wrested from him by you,
the half of that wealth and power is mine. Whatever

61
comfort, luxury, indolence, and extravagance you may
enjoy, I claim my right to enjoy the same. And now
get up, dear boy, and come back to the house. Walk
on, Arthur Walsingham and Company, but remember
your senior partner walks behind you, though he may
choose to keep in the shadow.”
Five minutes after the two men had left the shelter
of the beech, another man parted the branches close
behind the arm upon which they had been seated, and
crept stealthily away through the thick undergrowth, in
the direction of the gates.
Pale and shivering, Arthur Walsingham walked along
the avenue, across the bridge, and through the gardens.
Some doomed and wretched criminal, stumbling up the
steps of the gallows, might have walked as he walked,
and looked as he looked; while the hangman, who
sometimes assists the unhappy wretch to mount the
scaffold, would have borne no little resemblance to the
brilliant Major, who sauntered close behind his friend,
with one hand resting lightly on his shoulder. Even in
the graceful position of this delicate hand, there was
something of the action of a police-officer who has ap-
prehended his victim. Something which seemed to say,
more plainly than the words of the Major himself,
“Hunted down, Arthur Walsingham! hunted down!"
CHAPTER VII.
WORKING UNDERGROUND.
MAJOR GRANVILLE VARNEY appeared to find no difficulty
in making himself quite at home at Lislewood Park.
He sent to Brighton for his luggage, which arrived
under the care of his valet, a Jewish-looking person
called Salamons. There were people in Calcutta so
malicious as to say that this dark-eyed Israelite had not
always been the Major's valet, but that he had once
been the manager of a small provincial theatre, on the

boards of which a pretty sister of his had performed the
principal characters of the British drama; and these
malevolent Anglo-Indians would sometimes go so far as
to affirm that the pretty sister aforesaid was neither
more nor less than the present Mrs. Granville Varney,
and that the Major, being in England on furlough, had
fallen desperately in love with her, on seeing her play
at her brother's theatre, and had married her off-hand.
Be it how it might, Mrs. Varney was accomplished,
elegant, beautiful, fascinating; she had the richest and
purest of contralto voices, and had that faculty for
music which is so high above all ordinary talent as to
be worthy of the divine name of genius. If the sleek
oily Jewish valet were indeed her brother, she did not
display any great affection for that relative, but would
sweep past him, with her white eyelids drooping
proudly over her long dark eyes, as if he were some-
thing too insignificant for her to be even aware of his
presence.
After the first day or two of the Major's visit, Captain
Walsingham's spirits improved wonderfully. The two
men generally played billiards the best part of the day,
and écarté half the night. Mrs. Varney and Claribel
would sometimes loiter into the billiard-room, and look
on while the gentlemen played. The Major laughed and
talked, as he handled his cue. He paid compliments to
the ladies, and rattled away with unceasing vivacity, as
the shining ivory balls ran over the green cloth. Arthur
Walsingham, on the contrary, played with a feverish
earnestness. He seemed never to grow weary. He left
the billiard-room with regret, and returned to it with
impatience. At their evening games of écarté it was he
who urged the Major to continue playing; it was he
who would keep his friend seated at the little table long
after the ladies had retired to their rooms. Whoever
had watched the faces of the two men, bending over
the small table, with a shaded lamp between them,
would have said, that with the Major play was an
amusement, a caprice, or a convenience; but that with

67
the Captain it was a deeply-rooted and absorbing
passion.
While all this was taking place at the house, Gilbert
Arnold, the lodge-keeper, smoking his pipe within the
shadows of his doorway, looked out with envy and
dislike at the visitors and their servants.
“ So Captain No-one-knows-who, of Nowhere Castle,
has got a friend come to visit him, has he?” he said to
his wife one morning, a few days after the Major's
arrival; “I suppose this new gentleman will expect my
son to lie down and be walked over by him as well as
the rest of 'em. That's what they are always driving
at, these high swells. But we won't do it, will we,
Jim ?” he added, addressing himself to the boy swing-
ing on the gate of the little garden.
Won't do what, father?”
“We won't lie down and be walked over by rich
people's shiny leather boots, eh, Jim ?”
“Not if we know it, father," the boy said, looking
up at the poacher's grim face, with a glance of preco-
cious cunning.
Gilbert burst into a loud laugh. “That's my own
son, a chip of the old block,” he said ; “none of your
mother's puling about our betters; none of the curate's
nonsense about honouring our pastors and masters, and
being thankful for broken victuals.”
“Father," cried the boy, “ the Captain, and that
gentleman with the whiskers, and Sir Rupert, are
coming down to the gates."
“Are they, lad? Then you'll get a sixpence, per-
haps, if you stand in the way. Take their money
but don't take their impudence, Jim; that's my
advice.”
The boy nodded, and clambering off the garden-gate,
ran out into the avenue.
“Here they come,” said Gilbert; “ here comes the
Captain and his fine officer friend. I never saw such a
fellow! He makes one's eyes wink, he's so bright and
whining. Here comes Sir Rupert on his pony. Why

shouldn't my boy have a pony? He's a finer boy for
his age than that one,” grumbled Gilbert Arnold. .
The two gentlemen were walking side by side, the
Captain holding the bridle of the little Baronet's
pony:
“Arthur," said the Major, as they approached the
gate, “ do you know anything about that reformed
poacher of yours ?”
“Nothing but that he has been a desperate fellow in
bis time, and that he has now taken to reading Mr.
Maysome's tracts, and attending church twice every
Sunday.”
“Good !” said the Major. “Fonnerly a desperate
poacher, latterly a sanctimonior 8 l ypocrite. Now, my
dear Arthur, that is exactly they surt of man I consider
interesting, as a study-mind, purely as a study. You
can't give me any of the particulars of his former life,
can you ?"
"No. I believe he was away from Sussex for a year
or two; was sent to prison in Hampshire for some fray
with gamekeepers ; and on his turn to Lislewood
married Rachel Dawson, the lodge-keeper's daughter;
and has done nothing ever since but hang about the
place, as you now see him.”
“Yes, there he is,” said the Major gaily; "yellow
eyes with a tinge of greco in them-cat's eyes, that
change in the sunshine; a cat's step, slow and cautious;
and a cat's treachery, I daresay, if need were. Arthur
Walsingham, I am a student of human nature, and I
shall study that man.”
They reached the gate as the Major left off speaking.
“Good morning, Arnold,” said the Captain.
The man gave a sulky nod, and pulled off his greasy
cap ; but he pulled it off with an angry tug, as if he
hated the necessity which made him do so. The little
Baronet, dressed in a black velvet tunic, and mounted
on his pony, looked down inquisitively at the lodge-
keeper's son in corduroy trousers, holland blouse, and
hob-nailed boots.


## p. 65 (#69) ##############################################

“Egad!" said the Major ; “ those two boys are ex-
actly of an age, I should think.”
“My lad's a year younger than Sir Rupert,” growled
Gilbert Arnold
“A year younger! Then he's a very fine fellow for
his age, my good friend. They are just about of a size,
I should fancy. Jump off your pony, Baronet, and let
us see which is the taller, you or little Arnold yonder.”
The boy sprang to the ground, and the Major placed
the two children carefully back to back. Sir Rupert
had taken off his hat, and their two uncovered heads
were exactly level.
“There's not the eighth of an inch difference between
them,” said Major Varney; "and I declare, their hair
is precisely the same colour.”
The Major was right; the long curls of the Baronet,
and James Arnold's closely-cropped hair, were of the
same flaxen shade. Both the boys had light-blue eyes,
pale faces, and sharp but delicate features; but so great
was the distinction made by the rich dress and flowing
locks of one, and the ungainly garments and close-cut
hair of the other, that the careless observer lost sight of
the striking resemblance between the children.
“If my friend Arnold," said the Major, “were to
dress his boy like Sir Rupert, they might pass for
brothers. Give the little lad a ride on your pony,
Baronet, and let's see how he sits."
Major Varney lifted the boy into the saddle ; but
James Arnold inherited his father's envious temper,
without his father's bull-dog courage. The moment the
Major urged the pony into a trot, the child turned pale
and began to cry.
“How's this?” said the Major, lifting him off ; “ he
shivers in every limb; surely he isn't frightened ? ”
“He's rather timersome,' answered the father.
“ Timersome!” cried Major Varney; "timersome! I
never saw anything like it. Sir Rupert is as delicate
as a girl, but he can sit his pony like a man, and is no
more afraid of a hedge than I am. Are you, Baronet p."

Lady Lisle.
He hor; layihis bogourage
he said, turning to the boy, who had clambered into his
saddle again.
“No, Major. James Arnold is a coward; he cries if
you hit him. I hate cowards!”
“Hush ! Baronet; that isn't gentlemanly. Courage
is constitutional, and so is cowardice. This boy can't
help being frightened," said the Major, laying his hand
upon the lad's flaxen hair. “He has a nervous tem.
perament; and a man with a strong will could do
whatever he liked with him. I'd make that child follow
me like a dog, and look in my face to see what he was
to say, before he had the pluck to speak. Take care of
your son, Arnold, or he'll give you trouble by and by."
“Thank’ee, sir,” answered the lodge-keeper sulkily ;
“I ain't afeared.”
“Ah! I understand. You don't like my interference.
Never mind, my friend; we shall understand each other
better shortly; we shall understand each other better,
much better,” said Major Varney, rubbing his white
hands, and laughing pleasantly, with his glittering blue
eyes glancing, in a side-way direction, at the surly lodge-
keeper.
Gilbert Arnold's yellow-green optics blinked under
this searching side-glance, as if the auburn-whiskered
Major had been one dazzling ray of sunlight.
“Good day, my friend. I shall drop in before long,
and have a chat with you. Come, Baronet; come,
Arthur, dear child ; now for a ramble.”
The iron gates clanked upon their hinges, and closed
on the party, as the Major spoke. Gilbert Arnold stole
gut of his favourite shadow when they were gone, and
looked down the high road after them.
“Hang that yellow-looking chap !” he said savagely,
“Who's he, I wonder, that he comes and reckons a
man up as if he was a sum in cyphering ? Curse his
aristocratic impudence!”
Major Granville Varney was a long time over his
toilette that evening. It seemed as if he would have

never finished brushing his glistening auburn hair, and
smoothing his well-trained yellow moustaches; but he
paused at last, with two ivory-backed brushes in his
hand, and looked thoughtfully at his Jewish valet, who
stood by, with his master's black waistcoat hanging
over his arm.
“Salamons, you are leading a very quiet life in this
dismal country-house. I hope your intellect is not
getting rusty," said Major Varney, after having con.
templated his servant for some moments with a covertly
scrutinizing glance.
“I hope not, sir; especially if- "
“ Especially if I want you to exercise that intellect
in my behalf, eh, Salamons ? I understand you. You're
a very worthy creature, Salamons, and I may soon be
in a position to double your wages. Now take your
note-book, and listen to me.”
Mr. Salamons, with the Major's waistcoat still
hanging on his arm, drew a leather memorandum-
book from his pocket, opened it, took out a short lead.
pencil, and prepared himself to write. The leaves of
this memorandum-book were written over and crossed
and re-crossed in almost every direction ; so that the
Major's valet had some difficulty in finding a clean
place.
“There is a poacher fellow at the gates of the park,"
said the Major, waving the brushes in a circular direc-
tion, to give effect to his discourse, “called Gilbert
Arnold. Put down Gilbert Arnold, poacher.”
Mr. Salamons wrote, in a short, squat, heavy hand-
writing, with the letters all huddled one over the other,
Gilbert Arnold, poacher.
“He has been in Winchester gaol for a fray with
gamekeepers. Put down Winchester gaol.”
Mr. Salamons wrote Winchester gaol over Gilbert
Arnold, poacher.
“Now shut your book, and listen to me." The Major
threw down the brushes, and flung himself into an
easy-chair. Mr. Salamons closed his memorandum-

book, put it in his pocket, and stood deferentially
awaiting his master's communication.
“This poacher fellow has been in Winchester gaol
for an offence that he has committed. He has been in
Lewes gaol twice for other offences; but he has com-
mitted some crime for which he has never been
punished.”
“ And you got your information, sir ?"
“From the man's face. From his blinking eyes, that
shift under the glance of mine. From his stealthy step,
and his crouching attitudes. Every morning that man
gets up, he says to himself, “I may be taken before
night. If he is going to shave, he throws down his
razor, for he thinks, 'I may wear a prison dress before
night, and have my hair cropped by a prison barber.'
Salamons, years ago that man committed a crime, and,
long as he has escaped detection, he lives in daily dread
of being apprehended for it. He may, perhaps, think
that he is safe how; but fear has become such a habit
of his mind, that, in spite of himself, he is afraid. Oh,
Salamons, what a comfort it is to have a clear con-
science, and no fear of ever having to wear that un-
becoming prison dress !” The Major laughed aloud at
this consoling thought, and abandoned himself for some
moments to an agreeable reverie.
“Now, Salamons,” he resumed presently, “I dare-
say you can guess what I want you for. You must
leave this place early to-morrow. I can't tell you
where to hunt up your information, or how to hunt it
up. I rely upon your own sagacity, and I merely say
to you, find out the secret hidden in the past life of
Gilbert Arnold, and come back to me with the intelli-
gence. I have an idea that it may some day be useful.
And now, give me my waistcoat."
The Major finished his toilette, and dismissed his
servant. The door of an inner room opened, and Mrs.
Varney, dressed in white, with natural flowers in her
dark hair, stood upon the threshold.
“You look very lovely to-night, my sonl's idol,” said

the Major, tenderly. Those flowers have an air of
innocence that becomes you admirably. Ada, otherwise
Adeline Varney, how would you like to be mistress of
Lislewood Park ?"
“Don't talk nonsense, Granville !” said the lady;
“but come downstairs. I thought you would never
have finished dressing."
“Ada, the train must be a very long one that would
undermine this house, and we should begin to lay the
gunpowder a great way off, should we not ? But don't
you disturb yourself, my darling. The grand system
is at work. Alfred Salamons has received his instruc-
tions. Great things may be done yet, and all with a
clear conscience—with a clear conscience, and no fear
of the prison dress from first to last."
CHAPTER VIII.
BEECH E R'S RIDE.
Five weeks had passed since the advent of the Major
and his wife, and the morning had arrived upon which
they were to take their departure from Lislewood Park.
They were going back to Brighton for a week or two
prior to returning to London, where they were to stay
until the expiration of the Major's furlough. They were
to travel in their own carriage, with their own horses
and coachman, and with Mr. Salamons in the rumble.
Major and Mrs. Varney lounged on the terrace with
their host and hostess, while their travelling parapher-
nalia were being packed in the carriage by the expert
Mr. Salamons.
“ Arthur," said the Major, “the high road winds
under the hill you call "Beecher's Ride,' doesn't
it?"
“ Under the hill, yes; but not under Beecher's Ride
itself, that's on the further side."
“ Then suppose you and I take a walk up there while

Salamons packs those things. He'll be ever so long
about it. Ada can wait for me in the high road. I
shall see the carriage from the hill. I've a few parting
words that I want to say to this dear Arthur.”
The Major made his adieu to Mrs. Walsingham, flung
a great Scotch plaid over his shoulder, and directed his
wife where to meet him with the carriage.
At this moment the little Baronet galloped round
from the stables on his pony.
“Papa, may I go with you ?” he asked eagerly.
Captain Walsingham hesitated, and looked at his
friend.
“By all means, Sir Rupert," said the Major, “come
along with us.”
Major Varney stopped at the lodge to drop a sovereign
into Gilbert Arnold's hand.
“Good day to you, my friend,” he said ; “ remember
my advice and take care of that boy of yours, if you
don't want to get into trouble by and by."
“ All right, sir,” said the lodge-keeper, with a leer of
low cunning in his eyes.
Once more the great iron gates closed with a loud
clanking noise upon the little master of Lislewood Park.
Child as he was, if he could have dreamed for a
moment of that which lay before him on the outer side
of those splendid gates, surely the hollow clang of the
closing lock would have sounded to him like the funeral
knell of his young life.
They were nearly an hour walking up the winding
road that led to the hills upon which Captain Wal-
singham had met Lady Lisle on the evening of his
return to England. When they had reached the sum-
mit, the two men drew breath and looked about them.
The Major looked at Sir Rupert, and then glanced
significantly at Captain Walsingham.
"Rupert, take your pony for a gollop on the hill-side
yonder. I want to talk to Major Varney," said the
Captain, in obedience to his companion's look.
The boy nodded. smacked his whip, and trotted

along the gentle slope, out of hearing, but not out of
sight.
Now, what is it?" asked the Captain, digging his
cane into the ground, and leaning heavily upon it. He
seemed prepared for a long interview.
The Major flung open his loose overcoat, and began
to play with the glistening ornaments hanging at his
watch-chain. Every hair of his yellow whiskers and
moustaches, every one of his square white teeth, shone
in the autumnal sunlight.
“What is it?" said the Captain, impatiently. “Why
have you dragged me here? What have you to say
this morning that you couldn't say last night?”.
“Can't you guess ?" asked the Major, with an agree-
able smile.
"No."
" That is to say, you won't. Sly old fox. He is
afraid to take the initiative, so I must do it myself.
Arthur, dear child, I want more money."
so you're going over that ground again, are you?
Then I tell you what I told you last night. I have no
more, and it will be some time before I can procure any
more. I've victimized my poor wife enough as it is.
I'll not ask her for another farthing.”
“Obstinate child !” The Major plunged his hand
into the pocket of his overcoat, took out a small bundle
of letters, very neatly folded, endorsed in a delicate
feminine-looking handwriting, and tied with a sky-
blue ribbon.
“ Look at these letters. They look quite pretty,
don't they? Shall I read them over to you ? or do
you remember the wording ?”.
The Captain turned away with a muttered oath.
Major Granville Varney held the little packet lightly
in one ungloved hand, while the idle fingers of the
other coquetted with the corners of the several docu-
ments. He peeped slyly into the folded papers,
nodding his head and humming softly to himself, or
sometimes stopping to chuckle over some passage

which seemed to strike him as peculiarly amusing. The
Captain watched him from under his black eyelashes
with a gloomy and sinister glance.
“Arthur, dear child, unless I have five thousand
pounds before the end of this month, Mrs. Walsingham
will receive this little packet upon the first of October.
Amusing as the letters are, I fear she'll scarcely see the
extent of their absurdity. She may take the matter
seriously. You're very fond of her, Arthur. Stupidly
fond; for upon my word, her imbecility is occasionally
wearisome; but I suppose there are some people who
can exist upon a perpetual diet of boiled chicken, and
by a parity of reasoning-
"Major Varney !”.
“Impulsive child. Is it to be the five thousand
pounds, or is the flaxen-haired lady to have these
letters ? Decide quickly, dear boy, for I think we are
going to have a shower.”
“I tell you I can't get the money. As to your send-
ing the letters, I am not afraid of that. You won't
kill your golden goose. You know better than that.
The infernal secret which you hold over me becomes
valueless the hour it is told. You are not the man to
tell it."
Major Varney bit his lip, and a certain crest-fallen
look stole over his smiling face. For one brief moment
his brightness left him, he seemed, as it were, to
tarnish; but he recovered himself instantly, and laughed
gaily, as he said: “ Arthur, you're such a sly fox,
there's no getting over you. No, you're right. I don't
want to tell the secret. I don't want to see poor Lady
Lisle, or Mrs. Walsingham, or whatever else she may
choose to call herself, break her heart. I don't want to
see you kicked out of Lislewood Park, or sent to some
apleasant colony, where they might have the imper-
tinence to ask you to pick oakum or break stones. No,
no, my dear Arthur ; what I want is to make things
pleasant for all parties. Will you believe me, if I say
I think that I have hit upon a method of doing so ?"

Beecher's Ride.
73
“Perhaps."
“Good." Then, Arthur, listen to me. I am not one
of those unlucky wretches to whom ready money is of
vital importance. If you will do me the favour to look
down the hill yonder, you may see my travelling chariot
and horses, my coachman, my valet. You may guess that
I don't do all this out of a Major's pay in the Company's
service. On the other hand, you can guess that I am
not in immediate want of a five-pound note. I would
rather have fifty thousand pounds ten years hence than
I would have five thousand to-day. Arthur Walsing-
ham, what is the age of that boy yonder ?" Major
Varney pointed, as he spoke, to Sir Rupert Lisle.
“What has that to do with you or your interest ? "
asked the Captain. .
“Never mind that; but answer the question. How
old is he?”
“ He was seven last July."
“Seven years old. Very good. What would you
say, Arthur, if I were to tear these silly letters and
that other little document into a thousand pieces, and
not ask you for a farthing for fourteen years?"
The Captain looked at his friend with a bewildered
stare.
“What are you talking about ? ” he asked impa-
tiently.
Major Varney drew his arm through that of his
companion, and leaning his disengaged hand on the
Captain's shoulder, whispered a few sentences which
blanched the soldier's dark cheek, and made his knees
knock together as if they would have given way under,
him. There was a short pause, during which the Major
watched the Captain's changing face.
“Will you do it ? ” he said at last, aloud; “or will
you let me do it?"
“ Scoundrel!” roared the Captain. “No, not to
save myself from the gallows."
“Booby!” said Major Varney, “don't be violent.
Not to save yourself from the gallows ?” he repeated,

scornfully. “Why, there's many a better man than
you would do as much for a twenty-pound note.
What is it? A little bit of legerdemain. Ladies and
gentlemen, you observe this shilling. Behold, I place
it under this cup. Hocus-pocus, it is gone! Hi,
presto, it has come back again!' And the juggler
presents the coin to his astonished audience, who be-
lieve him to be the cleverest of men, while the truth is,
my dear Arthur, that the coin which the prestigiator
shows is not the first shilling at all, but another shilling
exactly like the first. Captain Walsingham, do you
mean to stand in the way of our united fortunes, or
will you help me in this?"
“No, I tell you!”.
“ And if I do it without your assistance ?”
“I will expose the villanous plot, at whatever dis-
grace to myself.”
“ Arthur, you are incorrigible! Is this your final
decision ?""
6 It is."
6 Very well, then," said the Major, shrugging his
shoulders, “if that's the case, there's no help for it.
Remember,” he added, tapping the papers he held in
his hand. “Look for no mercy from me. When men
are such utter fools as to be blind to their own interests,
they cannot expect wiser people to suffer for their
blindness and folly. So call your step-son, Captain ;
I'll bid him good-bye, and then hurry down the hill
to the carriage. Poor Ada will be tired of waiting.”
Captain Walsingham called to Sir Rupert, who came
galloping up to the two officers.
“Sir Rupert,” said the Major, “I want to bid you
good-bye. I'm just going to turn my back upon
Beecher's Ride. By the bye, that reminds me that I
have heard the people hereabouts talk a great deal of
Beecher's Ride, but have never heard how the hill
came by the name. Explain the mystery, my dear
Araur. I am an ardent lover of local legends, and I
ant to know the legend of Beecher.”


## p. 75 (#79) ##############################################

Beecher's Ride.
“Pshaw!” said the Captain impatiently; "what do
you want to know about Beecher's Ride ?"
“Don't be discourteous, my Arthur, but gratify me
with the legend of Beecher. At the hazard of making
my sweet Ada impatient I must stop to hear about
Beecher.”
They were standing upon the sharp ridge of the first
and loftiest of a long range of hills. They faced the
steepest side, the slope of which was so abrupt as to
appear almost perpendicular.
*** This side of the hill, that is to say, the descent at
our feet, has been called Beecher's Ride," said the
Captain, “because about fifty years ago, a Captain
Beecher, a celebrated sportsman, rode down it upon
his thoroughbred mare for a wager."
“Was he killed ?" asked Major Varney,
“No, but the mare was."
The Major laughed. “Poor fellow! Then he lost
a valuable animal, if he won his wager. No one has
ever ridden down since, have they?”
“I have never heard of any one having done so."
Sir Rupert Lisle had been listening attentively to
this conversation. “I should like to ride down there,”
he said, pointing to the descent.
The Captain had walked away from them, and had
fung himself listlessly upon the short brown grass.
"I should very much like to do it," said the little
Baronet, “and I think my pony could manage it
too.”
“Nonsense, Baronet," answered the Major. “You're
not brave enough for that,” he added, laughing. “You
mayn't be such a coward as James Arnold, at the lodge;
but I don't believe you're brave enough to gallop down
Beecher's Hill. Upon my word, I don't believe you
are.”
There was a stubborn obstinacy in the Lisle blood,
which had often led the sons of that house to do more
desperate things than the most courageous men had
ever attempted. The Lisles of the good old Cavalier

times, when there was some romance still to be got
out of a gentleman's lite, had been distinguished for a
dogged determination to do anything they were sup-
posed not to be able to do, which is a quality that often
effects more than reckless and dashing courage can
achieve. Sir Rupert had the true Lisle nature-dull
and unimpulsive, but intensely obstinate.
The Major, with every one of his white teeth dis-
played in an insolent laugh, and with his face towards
the sun, was provokingly bright to look at.
“No, no, my little Baronet,” he said, “ you're not
brave enough to try that; for you're too sensible not
to know that it can't be done."
The boy's pale face flushed crimson with passion.
“ Can't it?” he screamed at the top of his shrill treble
voice. “Can't it be done, Major ? .
He turned his pony's head, galloped once round the
summit of the hill, and then, lashing the animal vio-
lently with his whip, flew over the narrow ridge and
down the hill-side. The Major saw the flush on the
boy's face fade away to a sickly white, in that one brief
moment in which the pony turned over the descent.
The Captain, aroused by the sound of the horse's hoofs,
sprang to his feet, and rushed to the brow of the hill
only in time to see the pony flying down the slippery
grass into the valley below.
" He'll do it," said the Major, “ without so much as
a bruise."
“ Devil! this is some of your work,” cried the Cap-
tain.
The pony reached the bottom of the hill, the boy
swaying backwards and forwards in his saddle, but
keeping his seat, but in the impetus of the last rush,
the animal lost his balance, and fell, rolling over his
rider. From where the two men stood, the pony and
the boy looked like one confused mass, which rolled
over and over for a few moments, and then grew sud-
denly still.
“This way!" shouted the Captain, as he rushed

77
along the winding road. He ran with all his might
across a gentle slope, and in less than five minutes
arrived breathless and panting at the spot on which his
step-son was lying.
The Major followed him, and was the first to fall on
his knees by the side of the pony and the child. Sir
Rupert was lying under the animal. Major Varney
untwisted the bridle, which had become entangled, and
the pony staggered to its feet. "No bones broken
there, anyhow," he said. “Hold the reins, Arthur,
while I look at the child.”
Sir Rupert Lisle lay on his back, perfectly still. A
few smears of blood about the forehead were the only
traces of the injuries he had received.
“Thank God!” said the Captain," he has only fainted
from the shaking.”
Major Granville Varney opened the boy's little coat,
and laid one hand upon his heart. He turned very pale
as he did so, and the light seemed to die out of his
yellow whiskers and moustache.
“He is dead,” he said gravely. “ Concussion of the
brain.”
“Pitiless devil!” cried the Captain, clutching Major
Varney by the throat, “ this is your doing.”
The Major, still very pale, released himself from Ar.
thur Walsingham's powerful grasp, and said quietly,
“ Arthur, be reasonable, and listen to me. I am as
innocent of this as you are. When I proposed to you
just now the scheme, which I thought would make both
our fortunes, I told you that not a finger should be laid
upon that child. I meant what I said ; but I was en-
raged by your folly, and amused myself by teasing the
hoy. What has happened came to pass through no
agency of mine. It is one of the strange chances
which baffle calculation. It has happened, and we can't
ando it; but ” he sank his voice to almost a whis-
per,—"we can turn it to our own use. Will you leave
me to act as I please ?”.
“ Yes.” Captain Walsingham clasped his hands over

Lady Lisle.
his terror-stricken face. “I swore to protect this boy,
and see how I have kept my oath!”
The Major took the plaid off his shoulders, and
spread it upon the trampled grass. He lifted the life-
less body of the boy, laid it upon the plaid, and covered
his still white face with his handkerchief.
“ Arthur,” he said, “keep watch here; if anybody
should come this way, take care they don't see what has
happened. I shan't be gone long."
He took the pony by the bridle, and led it away along
the narrow defile into some fields at a little distance.
Heedless of his own varnished boots, he dragged the
animal through clay and mire, till he came to a pool of
stagnant water, a mile from the scene of the catastrophe,
and about three miles from Lislewood Park. Into this
pool he drove the pony, lashing it violently with his
light riding-whip, and flinging the bridle over its head.
The animal splashed up to his neck through the water,
scrambled up the muddy bank on the other side of the
pool, and galloped furiously away over some stubble-
fields and into a stunted pine-wood. The Major
watched until the pony had quite disappeared, and then
walked rapidly back to the spot where he had left Cap-
tain Walsingham and the child. He found the Captain
seated by the side of the still little figure muffled in
the thick plaid.
“I thought you were never coming back," he said,
as the Major approached.
“Has any one been this way?”
“No one."
“Good. Now, Arthur, go home to the mother of
this child, and tell her you have lost him: no more,
remember. You have lost him; he galloped away from
you while you were talking to me, and you lost sight
of him. The pony will find its way back to the
stables."
He lifted the lifeless little form in his arms, and
walked a few paces towards the winding road, where
the carriage was waiting for him.

“ Arthur,” he said, " run over to the carriage, and
tell them to drive round here."
The Captain obeyed, and in a few minutes the wheels
rolled softly over the short grass as the carriage came
towards the Major. Mrs. Varney looked out of the
window, lovely and radiant, in a bonnet of the palest
pink.
“What is the matter ?" she asked.
“ Open the door, Salamons,” said the Major.
“Do you mind sitting with your back to the horses,
Ada ?” he added, as the hook-nosed valet opened the
door and let down the steps.
“Why?" she asked wonderingly.
The Major did not answer her, but taking her by the
wrist, drew her out of the carriage, and laid the muffled
figure along the seat. A magnificent leopard-skin,
with which Mrs. Varney's feet had been covered, lay in
a heap on the rug. He lifted this, and threw it over
the plaid.
"What is the matter with the child ?” asked Mrs.
Varney. “What has happened? Is he hurt ? ”
“Yes, seriously. I am going to take him to Brighton,
for better medical aid than we can get about here. Jump
in, Ada. Salamons, shut the door.”
The Major and his wife seated themselves with their
backs to the horses. The Captain laid his hand upon
the carriage-door. “What are you going to do with,.
with-the boy ?” he asked.
For the first time since the accident, Major Granville
Varney smiled.
“You know, or you can guess," he said. “ Au revoir,
dear boy.”
The carriage rolled away, leaving the Captain standing
staring after it, with a ghastly face.
“ Claribel Lisle,” he said, “that old treachery of yourg,
which blighted my life years ago, is now recoiling upon
yourself. Heaven help you, poor girl! Heaven help
you, for I cannot."

CHAPTER IX.
MAJOR VARNEY'S FIRST MOVE.
HALF-AN-HOUR after Captain Walsingham had returned
to Lislewood Park to tell his dismal story, every creature
in the neighbourhood knew that Sir Rupert Lisle was
missing. Every horse in the Lislewood stables had
been saddled, every male servant in the house and out
of the house had been enlisted in the work that was to
be done. They galloped along the wide high road—they
questioned the country people coming from market-
every creature they met, far or near. They flew through
winding lanes, across stubble-fields, and over the great
chain of hills which led away from Beecher's Ride. But
they could obtain no tidings of the little boy on the
dapple pony.
Claribel Walsingham was like a creature distraught.
She wanted to go herself to seek for the boy, and she
would have rushed out of the house, had not her hus-
band caught her in his arms upon the threshold. She
accused and upbraided him in her mad anguish. “My
son, my son!” she cried. “I trusted him to you; you
swore to protect him. You should never have lived to
tell me that my child is lost." This woman, usually so
languid and unimpressionable, was terrible in her loud
agony. She paced up and down the splendid rooms,
lamenting her missing child in a paroxysm of despair.
The Captain had no power to comfort her. He hur.
ried out of the house, and rushed to the gates to wait
for the return of the men from the search that he knew
must be ineffectual. He found Gilbert Arnold at his
old post in the doorway of the lodge. The poacher's
boy was standing at the garden-gate. Captain Wal-
singham started at the sight of this boy's pale flaxen
hair, and fair sickly face, as if he had seen a ghost. He
thought of the motionless little figure wrapped in a
Scotch plaid, and lying on the stunted grass at the bote

hair, on which no mother's caressing hand would ever
rest again.
" Why are you not with the men who have gone to
look for Sir Rupert ?” he asked of the skulking lodge-
keeper.
“ Because there was plenty to look without me,” Gil-
bert answered sulkily. “I've enough to do to look
after my own boy. He'll be lost, or stolen, or murdered,
perhaps, next,” he added, with a grin.
The Indian officer sprang towards the gate, as if he
would have struck Gilbert Arnold; but the boy, who
stood in his way, began to cry.
“Hold your tongue, you white-livered little rascal!”
growled his father." He's not going to strike me.”
Captain Walsingham saw that the man had been
drinking. Gilbert plunged his coarse hands into the
pockets of his shooting-jacket, and jingled the change
out of the sovereign given to him by Major Varney.
The Captain looked at him searchingly. “Has he had
his lesson already ? ” he thought. “Does he know the
part he will have to play in the infernal plot ?".
It was dark when the Lislewood servants came home
to tell of their fruitless search; but before they returned,
the pony, dripping wet and covered with clay, had gal-
loped back to his stable. There was no doubt of what
had happened. The boy had been drowned. But how
and where ?
Claribel Walsingham asked neither of these questions.
She heard the story of the pony's return, and fell
stricken to the earth. With the first gleam of returning
light, the drags were busy in every pool and stream in
the vicinity of Lislewood Park. But all search was
vain; the day wore out and the body of Sir Rupert had
not been found. Great placards were pasted at regular
intervals along the whole extent of the park fences, on
the turnpike gates, in every village round about Lisle-
wood, setting forth, in letters a foot deep, how one hun.

persons who should lead to the discovery of the body of
Sir Rupert Lisle, Bart.
Every pool and streamlet had been dragged. Where,
then, could the boy have been drowned ? Men looked
at each other gravely, as this question was asked.
Little groups of people congregated at the doors of the
inns and beer-shops in Lislewood, and their talk was
entirely of the pretty little baronet, who had so strangely
disappeared. He had left the park with his step-father
and his step-father's friend. People had met the little
party on the high road, the Captain leading Sir Rupert's
pony by the bridle, and the boy had never afterwards
been seen by mortal eyes. Captain Walsingham's
account of his disappearance was sufficiently straight-
forward. He had gone down the hill to accompany the
Major to his carriage, and had left the child riding his
pony about the summit. On reascending the hill, after
an absence of little more than a quarter of an hour, he
had searched for the boy in vain. The step-father could
have had no motive for conspiring to take the life of
this helpless child. The Lislewood property, over which,
had his step-son lived, the Captain might have had
some control, would now go to a stranger. There was
no clue to the mystery of the boy's disappearance. If
he had been stolen by any wretches prowling about the
neighbourhood, they would have stolen his pony too.
He had been drowned then, undoubtedly. But where ?
A narrow river ran through a valley about five miles'
distance from Lislewood Park. The boy must have
crossed the hills, galloped down to the river, and been
drowned in trying to ford it. What could have taken
him in that direction, so far from the spot where the
Captain had left him ? A child's whim, perhaps. The
river was dragged without result. The tide had carried
the little corpse down to the sea. The wretched mother
would never again behold her fair-haired boy.
There was mourning in the splendid mansion of Lisle-
wood. The violence of Claribel Walsingham's first
passionate grief gave place to a quiet sorrow, which

knew no change or abatement. Every vestige of colour
left her wan cheeks, every gleam of light died out of
her blue eyes. She was never seen to weep, but she
was never seen to smile. She took no interest in any.
thing whatever. Had the house been in flames, she
would scarcely have left it of her own accord. She sat
all day in her room, refusing to see any one but her
husband and her confidential maid.
The Captain seldom entered that chamber of desola-
tion. He rode out of the gates every morning, and
returned at dusk, to sit smoking in the library, from
dinner-time till eleven or twelve o'clock at night. The
servants whispered among themselves that Captain
Walsingham had taken to drinking more than was good
for him, and that his wife's grief and the loss of his little
step-son were preying upon his mind. He had never
been celebrated for his high spirits since his return from
India ; but the silent gloom of his manner increased
after the disappearance of the boy. Sir Launcelot Lisle,
the new baronet, wrote from Florence, to entreat his
late kinsman's widow to retain possession of the man-
sion and park of Lislewood. His solicitor would
manage matters for him, he said; he had no wish to
exchange the hills of Florence for the bleak Sussex
downs. Mrs. Walsingham was welcome to occupy
Lislewood Park for the term of her natural life, and
she would confer a favour upon him by so doing.
The snow lay thick in the avenues of the park, and
hung in white masses apon the leafless branches of the
oaks, before the excitement caused by Mrs. Walsing-
ham's bereavement had in any degree subsided. Every
mother in the village of Lislewood had wept for the
sorrows of the great lady, whom they could remember
long before her first marriage. It was not without
some touch of remorse that the simple villagers re-
membered how often, as the Lislewood carriage dashed
through the village, they had envied the fair-haired
lady, dressed in costly silks and velvets, with her pretty
boy by her side. And now, who among them would

have cared to exchange lots with her ? They shuddered
as they heard, from some gossiping servant, of the
desolation that reigned in the gorgeous rooms; of the
Captain sitting smoking and drinking by his lonely
fireside till the dead of the night; of the silent lady,
lying in her darkened rooms, weary of the world in
which her portion had been so fair à one, and praying
for the death which would restore her to her child.
Amongst others, Rachel Arnold was sorry for the lady
at the great house.
Seated, one snowy night in January, by the narrow
fireplace in her little parlour, she ventured to say as
much in the presence of her husband.
“What's that?" muttered Gilbert Arnold, looking at
her savagely from under his thick eyebrows. “What's
that you're mumbling there?”
I said I was thinking of the poor lady up yonder,
Gilbert. I've just been upstairs, looking at little
James; and when I see him lying safe in his cot, it
always makes me think of poor Sir Rupert, some-
how.”
“ The boys was alike,” said Gilbert, thoughtfully,
looking at the little grate, and emptying his pipe upon
the iron bar. “Lord love you! I like to hear 'em talk
about your good old blood, and your county families,
and all such muck as that! My boy's every bit as good-
looking as ever Sir Rupert Lisle was, and better-looking
too."
“When I was quite a girl, Gilbert," said the wife,
blushing faintly as she spoke, “I was counted rather
like Miss Merton by some of our folks.”
Mr. Gilbert Arnold was by no means over-burdened
with gallantry. He stared at his wife with an un-
pleasant grin for a few moments, and then laughed
aloud. “Was you ?” he said. “Then I never see it,
for one; and if ever you was like her, you ain't like her
now, I can tell you that, for your comfort.” He care-
fully refilled and lighted his pipe, put his awkwardly
shod feet upon the hob, and recommenced smoking.

“Hard work has taken the beauty out of me, Gilbert,"
said his wife.
“Ay, my wench, that it has, if ever there was any to
take," he growled.
“But my hair was light, and my eyes were blue, like
my lady's.
so yes !” said Mr. Arnold, quite cheerfully; "your
hair's the sort as looks as if the colour had all been
washed out of it, and your eyes looks as if they'd been
took out of your head and boiled, by way of improving
of 'em, only it didn't answer. You're like my lady so
far," he said, with a laugh.
“Poor dear soul! I'm very sorry for her,” Rachel
murmured thoughtfully.
“Now you just look here,” said Mr. Gilbert Arnold,
taking his pipe out of his mouth, and striking his fist
on the little table at his side; “I ain't going to have
none of that; no snivelling for her: no moaning, and
complaining, and whimpering about her. She's got a
fine house, hasn't she ? She's got a carriage to ride in,
and good clothes to wear, and soft beds to lie on, and
rich food to eat, and strong wine to drink, and money
to spend,-ain't she? Then let that satisfy her! She's
never been fed on prison gruel,-has she? She's never
had her bit of bread doled out to her by the ounce
weight. She's never crouched under a hedge, for six
or seven mortal hours, of a cold winter's night, to snare
a hare, what she'd not get over a couple of shillings for
the next morning. She's not afraid to go six mile from
her home, for fear of being took up, and accused of
something as she never did, or as nobody can prove she
ever did. Let that satisfy her, then! And if her boy's
drowned, he's drowned. Others have had to bear such
things, and she must bear it. She's had her share of
the good things ; let her take her allowance of the
bad."
The cold wind and the falling snow came rushing
into the little room, and with the sound of the winter
blast there was mingled another sound--the sound of

two soft hands struck one upon the other, in gentle
applause.
*** What's that?"
Gilbert Arnold started to his feet, with a wild look
of alarm in his yellow-green eyes, and turned round to
face the doorway.
A stranger stood upon the threshold, confronting the
terrified lodge-keeper, a tall man, who was wrapped in
a loose overcoat, and wore a gay parti-coloured Cash-
mere shawl, in which yellow was the predominating
hue, muffled round his throat. He wore his hat so low
upon his forehead, and his neckerchief so close up to
his nose, that nothing was to be seen of his face but
this latter organ, which was a strongly-marked aquiline.
Gilbert Arnold trembled like a leaf. He caught the top
rail of the chair in which he had been sitting, and clung
to it for support, but it gave way under his weight, and
he kicked it from him with an oath.
" What is it? What do you want me for ?” he said.
He glanced furtively, as he spoke, in the direction of
the little staircase, leading to the top story, rather as if
he would have made an attempt to escape from this
strange visitor by rushing up the stairs.
The stranger laughed aloud,-a clear ringing silvery
joyous laugh, which Gilbert Arnold had heard before.
He took off his hat, shook the snow on to the sanded
boards, and closed the door behind him. He threw off
his overcoat, seated himself by the little fire, ran his
hands through his glistening golden hair, and then sat
thoughtfully twirling his long moustaches, and looking
at Gilbert Arnold with a pleasant smile. The lodge-
keeper made a shambling half-apologetic bow.
“Major ––” he said, hesitating for the name.
“Granville Varney. Precisely. It appears that you
have very few visitors here, my worthy friend, from the
extraordinary effect my intrusion produced upon you."
Gilbert Arnold's face flushed crimson. He looked at
the little Dutch clock ticking in a corner. “Why, it's
rather late," he muttered.


## p. 87 (#91) ##############################################

Major Varney's First Move.
“Ah, to be sure, Half-past eleven. It is late. I
left London by the nine o'clock express, on purpose to
have a chat with you, Arnold. It's a long way from
the station, but as I didn't want any of your gossip-
ing neighbours to know of my visit, I came here on
foot; that's why I'm late. Now, then, to business.
You thought I should come, didn't you?”
The lodge-keeper rubbed his blue chin with one
hand and hesitated. “Why," he said, “I-
“You expected to see me, of course. I knew you
would.”
Rachel Arnold looked from her husband to the Major
in utter bewilderment.
“Go to bed,” said Gilbert; “ we don't want none of
your prying nor listening; go to bed.”.
“Don't be discourteous to your amiable wife, my
worthy friend,” said the Major, smiling sweetly.
“ What our good Arnold would say, ma'am,” he added,
“is merely this: As we are about to have a little
serious conversation, of a strictly confidential character,
and as the hour is by no means early, he would
recommend your retiring to rest. He is an excellent
fellow, but he has his own way of putting things, and
it isn't always a pleasant way. Good night.” The
Major waved his ringed white hand, and seemed to
wave Mrs. Arnold out of the little sitting-room. She
crept upstairs, and threw herself, dressed as she was,
upon the bed, where she lay listening to the murmur of
voices in the room below, and moistening her flock
pillow with slow silent tears.
The staircase was shut in by a door opening upon
the sitting-room. This door Major Granville Varney
locked with his own hand. Having done this, he
seated himself opposite to Gilbert Arnold.
“Get yourself a fresh pipe,” he said, pointing to the
broken fragments of the one which the lodge-keeper
had dropped in his agitation.
Gilbert took a long clay pipe from a cupboard by the
fireplace; the Major produced a cigar, and lighted it at

the little candle burning on the table. He smoked half
of it before he uttered a word; and then, looking up at
the lodge-keeper, who stood leaning against the mantel-
piece, intently watching his visitor, he said, in a polite
tone:-
“You were frightened just now, when I dropped in
upon you so suddenly. Did you think that they—you
kuow who—had found you at last?”.
Gilbert Arnold stared at the Major, as if that smil.
ing yellow-whiskered individual had been a ghost.
" Let me see. You've lived at this place seven years
and more; two years before that, you were in Win
chester gaol; and a year before that, you were at
Sevenoaks, in the county of Kent.”
The clay pipe dropped out of the lodge-keeper's
hand, and shivered into atoms on the hearthstone."
“ There goes another halfpenny,' said the Major.
6 My worthy friend, you are positively nervous.”
"No man of my name was ever at Sevenoaks," mut-
tered Gilbert, looking into the coals, and studiously
avoiding the steely blue eyes of the Major.
“No man of your name, very likely, my excellent
friend; but you see some men have so many names.
Suppose we drop you for the present, and talk of some-
body else. Suppose we talk of Josiah Bird.”
The lodge-keeper dropped into his chair as if he had
been shot. He wiped the cold perspiration from his
forehead with the open palm of his sunburnt hand.
“You don't care about hearing of Josiah Bird ?
My worthy friend, I dislike giving pain to any one,
but I can't get on very well without talking of this
man Bird.”
The Major took a small memorandum-book from his
pocket. He selected a tiny pencil from the bunch of
ornaments hanging to his watch-chain, unclasped the
book, and turning over the leaves till he came to the
place he wanted, dotted his pencil upon it, and said,
with deliberation, “As I have an idea, my worthy
Arnold, that you are an extremely clever fellow, I shall

be thoroughly candid in all my dealings with you. I
believe that you can be useful to me, or I should not
be here. If I thought you a fool, I should make use of
you, without telling you that I was doing so. As I do
not think you a fool, I fancy that you will be likely to
serve me all the better, if I let you into some of the
secrets of my policy. Gilbert Arnold, I never com-
mitted a punishable offence in my life.” The Major
leaned back in his chair, and laughed aloud, as if this
fact had been the most excellent joke.
“No,” he said, “I am an officer in the East India
Company's service. I have only a major's pay. No
one ever bequeathed me a sixpence; no one ever gave
me a sixpence; I am never in debt; and I live at the
minimum rate of a couple of thousand a year. I never
in my life have placed myself in the power of the law;
I never ran the risk of being dressed in prison clothes
and fed on prison fare; but I know more of other
people's crimes than any man living, except the mem-
bers of the detective police. You may ask why I
cultivate this class of information. I shall merely tell
you that it is a study I have a fancy for. The proper
study of mankind,' observes the poet, “is man.' I am
decidedly of the poet's opinion. The most profitable
subjects for a wise man's study are the peccadilloes and
delinquencies of his weaker brothers. When I want a
man, I don't bribe him, I don't threaten him. When
I want a man, I set myself to work to hunt up his
past history! I want you, my dear Arnold, and I have
made it my business to find out all about you.”
There was a gun in a corner of the room, behind the
Major's chair. Gilbert Arnold's eyes glanced involun-
tarily in that direction. Rapid as the glance was,
Major Granville Varney saw it. He wheeled his chair
round, and placed himself in a convenient position for
following Gilbert's eyes.
“Don't think of that, my good friend,” he said
politely. “Wait a few minutes, and you will see that
I am here for our mutual interest. Now, then, to return

to Josiah Bird. Ten or eleven years ago, you were a
fine stalwart young man, unfortunately only too well
known in this neighbourhood as Gil the poacher, and
ultimately compelled, by too free an indulgence in the
use of wire snares, to disappear from the county of
Sussex, after having made a brief sojourn in Lewes
gaol.”
“It was only a hare and a couple of pheasants,"
muttered the lodge-keeper apologetically,
“No, on that occasion the affair was very insignifi.

guage and threatened to shoot the gamekeeper who
took you in custody; but I dare say that was only a
vulgar slander. Well, after a couple of months' sojourn
at Lewes, Gil the poacher disappeared, and the landed
gentlemen round Lislewood congratulated themselves
on his departure. So far, so good. We come now to
Josiah Bird.”
“I don't know who you're talking of, nor what
you're talking of,” said Gilbert savagely, with the same
involuntary glance over the Major's shoulder towards
the weapon behind that officer's chair,
“Don't you really, my good friend? What a silly
hankering you have after that gun of yours! Favour
me with your attention for ten minutes, and you'll see
how foolish you have been. Now, in the neighbourhood
of Sevenoaks, Kent, there are several extensive pre-
serves. One amongst others afforded a rich field to the
poacher. In the autumn of the year 'thirty-five the
game disappeared off this particular estate, to an extent
that aroused the indignation of the owner and his
gamekeepers. One of these men, a resolute stalwart
fellow, of some six feet high, told his master that he
thought he could hit upon the man who did the mis-
chief. 'I know him,' he said ; 'he's a sneaking mean.
spirited hound, called Josiah Bird. He's been seen
hawking game in Sevenoaks. I'd forgive him if he
used a gun, like a man, for then there'd be a chance of

catching him at it; but he crawls about, snaring the
game under your nose, and slips through your fingers
like an eel. But I've got my eye upon him, and so
sure as I get hold of him, he shall pay for it.' Perhaps
this came to Josiah Bird's ears, for a week afterwards
the gamekeeper was found one morning lying in a
copse, with his brains battered out. They traced the
footsteps of a man through the fern, which was stained
here and there by great drops of blood. Of course
there was an inquest, and at the inquest a good many
trivial circumstances came to light, all of which seemed
to point to Mr. Bird as the assassin. More than one
person swore to having heard the poacher threaten to
do for' his enemy,-and doing for a man, my dear
Arnold, generally means a good deal with people of
your class. The heel of a shoe was found among the
fern in the track of the murderer, and a cobbler in the
neighbourhood swore to having put that very heel on
one of Mr. Bird's shoes—an awkward fact for the man
calling himself Josiah Bird, as I am sure you will
readily admit. The surgeon of a little village in the
neighbourhood told how a man had come to him before
it was light to ask him to dress a gunshot wound under
his knee; a wound that might lame him, but that
would, at any rate, leave a scar that would last him his
life. This man was Josiah Bird. The woman at the
turnpike saw the same man limp through the gate at
day break, and heard him beg a lift from a waggoner
going to London. The inquest was adjourned; the hue
and cry was raised; a reward of a hundred pounds was
offered for the apprehension of the murderer; but from
that day to this the Sevenoaks constabulary have never
been able to get hold of Josiah Bird. I'm afraid if
ever they do, it will go hard with him, poor devil !”
said the Major, laughing.
Mr, Gilbert Arnold, sitting in a crouching attitude,
made as if he would have slid to the ground. The
Major, with the benevolent intention of preventing his
fall, clasped him suddenly by the right leg, and turning

up his joose trouser by a rapid movement with one
hand, seized the candle with the other, and held it close
to the under part of the poacher's knee.
“Egad!” said the officer, “it's a gunshot wound,
and uncommonly like Josiah Bird's. I thought you
had a weakness in that right leg, my good Arnold.”
My good Arnold pulled the leg of his trouser down
with a savage scowl.
“Now, my worthy friend," said the Major, rising,
“ I think we begin to understand each other. If I
hadn't wanted you, I should not have come down here
by the nine o'clock express, to tell you that story of
Josiah Bird. I don't think this is the safest neighbour-
hood for you to live in. The Sevenoaks constabulary
have not forgotten that affair, and people might take it
into their heads to find out a likeness between you and
Bird. A large city, my good friend, is the best place
for you; so take a hint from me before it is too late,
and come to London. Here is a ten-pound note, which
will pay the expenses of your journey. Of course, as a
good husband and father, you will bring your wife and
child. You will tell the people hereabouts that you are
going to America. Here is the address of a house to
which you will go on arriving in London. At that
house you will wait till it suits me to give you further
directions. Those directions you will receive either
through me or my servant, Salamons. Most likely
through Salamons. As a rule, I wash my hands of all
that sort of thing. I have a clear conscience, and I
never committed a punishable offence in my life. If
you were put in a witness-box to-morrow, all you could
say would be, that I ran down to Sussex one night, to
tell you about Josiah Bird. A jury would only think
me eccentric. My coat, if you please.”
The Major put on his coat, wrapped himself carefully
in an immense plaid, drew the cashmere shawl up to
his nose, pulled his hat over his eyes, and walked out of
the cottage.
“ Curse you !” muttered the lodge-keeper, apostro-

phizing the receding figure of the stalwart officer.
5. Curse you! how did you find that out ? After ten
years-after ten mortal slow miserable beggarly years,
to be blown at last, and to be your lacquey, your foot-
ball, the door-mat for you to wipe your dirty boots upon
for the rest of my days. Curse you!”
í He sprang across the little room, clutched the gun,
and darted out into the snowy avenue.
“I've a good mind to follow him; I've a good mind,"
he said, pausing for a moment with the butt-end of the
gun uplifted threateningly. But in the next instant he
lowered the weapon slowly, and turned to slink back to
his cottage. "Better not, better not,” he muttered; “I
mightn't be able to get away so easy this time.”
CHAPTER X.
THE MAJOR'S AMBASSADOR.
ACTING according to orders, Mr. Gilbert Arnold informed
his wife, a few days after the Major's visit to the lodge,
that he was getting sick of “this here hole,” and that he
should go off to America, where he might be thought as
good a man as other folks, and not have his youthful
foibles chucked in his face every day of his life. This
elegant remark was a hit at the benevolent curate, who
looked upon Mr. Gilbert Arnold as a prize penitent,
and who brought him tracts of an evangelical nature,
upon which the reformed poacher would discourse with
sanctimonious unction. “Yes,” said Gilbert, after a
long conversation with his wife, who cried bitterly at
the thought of leaving her kind mistress and her com-
fortable home, to brave the perils of a voyage to America
in the company of by no means too attentive a husband,
-"yes,” he said, “ you've no call to snivel, and you've
no call to make this here shindy; for whether you like
it, or whether you don't, we're off to New York in three

weeks from to-day; so you'd better put on your bonnet,
and go up to the great house and tell my lady you're
going to leave her, so if she's got anything to give you
she'd better give it you at once, and she may find some-
body else to live in this here hole, and be trampled on
by my fine Captain's shiny boots.”
Gilbert Arnold insisted on speaking of this trampling
operation as an understood part of his service, though he
had never met with anything but indulgence from either
Mrs. Walsingham or her husband.
Rachel, therefore, shed no more tears, or if she did,
she shed them in silence, and away from the searching
eyes of her husband, who sat by the fire smoking, and
watching her as she busied herself with the preparations
for the journey. She grew pale with terror at the mere
thought of what lay before her, the separation from
all old friends and familiar associations, the long sea-
voyage, the unknown country; but she was so much
afraid of her surly husband, that perhaps, had he
proposed their hanging themselves one morning, she
would have scarcely dared to oppose the scheme.
The three weeks flew quickly past. Rachel bade
good-bye to her mistress, who gave her a ten-pound
note and a trunk full of cast-off garments; and on a
dreary afternoon she and Gilbert and the boy, and
their goods and chattels, were conveyed in a cart
to the railway station. It was dark when the train
reached London, and as it entered the terminus,
Gilbert saw upon the platform a man whose face he
knew. This man was Mr. Salamons, Major Varney's
Jewish valet.
“O, you're true to your time, are you ?” he said,
as Arnold alighted. “ Look after your things. Get
your luggage on that cab, and then come to me,
and I'll give you the address of the house you're to
drive to.'s
“You'd better come along with us," said Gilbert;
“ we're strangers in this here place; and as I should
think, by the looks of it, everybody was just took stark

96
staring mad, I'd rather have some one with me as knows
the neighbourhood."
"Mr. Salamons' black eyes twinkled mischievously as
he looked at Gilbert Arnold. The lodge-keeper, dressed
in a thick pilot-coat, with a striped comforter round his
throat, a rabbit-skin cap upon his head, and a bundle
in his hand, looked by no means the most elegant of
travellers. “You'll improve, my friend,” thought Major
Varney's valet; “now we've taken you in hand, you'll
get a little science knocked into you before long. As it
is, you've all the will, but none of the talent, to be ono
of us ; but it'll come, it'll come !”.
Gilbert Arnold gathered together his luggage, pushed
his wife into a cab, and flung his son and heir in after
her, and then returning to Mr. Salamons, said to him
with manly brevity, “Now then!”
“Now then, what, Lord Chesterfield p” asked the
valet.
“This here direction, and quick about it, for I wants
to get a drink of beer.”
"O, you wants to get a drink of beer. Very well,
here's the address. Give it to the cabman; and when
you get to the house, give him half-a-crown, and if he
asks for more, slam the door in his face. I shall look
round before ten o'clock," added Mr. Salamons, as
Arnold hesitated; “so cut off.” Having said which,
Major Varney's factotum turned his back upon the
lodge-keeper, and strolled out of the station. Well,”
he said to himself, “ that's a queer specimen of Major
Yellow-whisker's tools, anyhow. I'm blessed if I can
see the game my chief's driving at; but I suppose I'm
safe in acting up to orders. Our great commercial
firm has evidently started a new spec, and time must
show whether it's likely to be worth anything to the
house."
The cab drove the worthy Gilbert and his family to
a house in an obscure street leading out of the Waterloo
Road. They alighted, and were received by a pale-faced
woman, in a black-lace head-dress, who showed them

into a tawdrily furnished parlour, which she said had
been taken by a dark-haired party for a party from
Yorkshire by the name of Green.
Now as the Arnolds neither answered to the name of
Green nor came from Yorkshire, Rachel was about to
pronounce that there must certainly be some mistake ;
but Gilbert stopped her with a frown, and said that it
was all right, and the best thing the landlady could do,
would be to get him some beer and something to eat,
and to look sharp about it.
Beer, and something to eat, in the shape of fat mutton
chops, with hot water poured over them by way of gravy,
being provided, Gilbert Arnold seated himself at the
little table, and ate a tremendous meal ; after having
finished which, he politely suggested that his wife and
child had better take a bit. He smoked his clay pipe
in silence, while Mrs. Arnold and the boy emptied the
dish of the fat ends of the chops, and drank the dregs
of the porter, and then he told them they had better get
to bed at once, as that chap they met at the station was
going to drop in, and he wouldn't want them spying
and listening about the place. Rachel took her boy
by the hand, and retired submissively to a bedroom on
the floor above, and Gilbert, being left to himself, sat
smoking and drinking till, just as the clocks were strik-
ing ten, he heard a double knock at the street-door, which
he got up and opened himself. He found Mr. Salamons
standing upon the threshold.
“I hope you've got a good fire,” said that gentleman,
as he came into the parlour; “for this night's cold
enough to freeze a man's nose off his face.”
The hook-nosed valet had acquired a good deal of his
master's free-and-easy manner; he flung himself into the
chair in which Mr. Arnold had been seated, drew it close
to the fire, and put his feet on the fender.
“Now, then," he said, “listen to me. It's a rule
of mine, and of the person who employs me, never to
bay a word that can be conveniently leit unsaid ; there-
fore, if you don't look sharp, you won't catch my

meaning. It's likely that you'll be wanted-or perhaps
it's your wife that will be wanted, or, maybe, your
boy that will be wanted; anyhow, it's the wish of the
person who employs me that you shall stop in this
house till he makes other arrangements for you. You'll
ask no questions; and if other people question you,
you'll answer none. You'll receive every week a post-
office order for one-pound-ten, payable to John Green,
by which name you'll pass for the present, from Alfred
Salamons. That's as much as you'd earn at any trade
that you're good for; so you've reason to be content.
By and by you'll get more ; and if you mind your P's
and Q's, you may be a rich man some of these days.
If anybody asks who you are, why, you're a shoemaker,
or a carpenter, or anything you like, out of work. If
they ask you how you contrive to live, why, you've a
rich brother, who's up in the world, and who sends you
a weekly income. So far, that's easy enough. Now,
then, for two conditions upon which your safety
(always keeping in mind Josiah Bird) depends. First
and foremost, take care of that boy of yours. Watch
him as you'd watch a prince of the blood royal, if you
had the charge of one. Let harm come to him, and
harm will come to you. That's condition number one.
Condition number two is silence. If ever it comes to
my ears, or to my employer's ears, that you've so much
as breathed his name, or even my name, you'll hear
something more about Josiah Bird. And now, good
night. Show me a light, and open the street door."
Mr. Salamons was so rapid in his delivery of this
speech, that the bewildered lodge-keeper was utterly
unable to interrupt him by a single question, and before
he had in any way recovered from his bewilderment,
the Major's valet had turned the corner of the street,
and was lost in the Waterloo Road.
" Thirty shillings a week," muttered Gilbert, as he
drained the pewter pot of the last dregs of beer ; " that's
starvation wages enough for a fine gentleman like
Major Varney to offer a fellow. But he knows that

about me that might hang me, so I must take whatever
he likes to offer. Curse him!” With which concluding
and very favourite ejaculation, Mr. Arnold retired to
bed. To bed, but by no means to sleep; only to toss
about all night, listening to the noises in the Waterloo
Road, or to fall into fitful slumbers, in which he
dreamed that he was standing in a wood near Sevenoaks,
in the early dawn of a bright summer's day, hearing a
lark sing high above his head, and looking down at
the ashen blood-bedabbled face of a dead man.
CHAPTER XI.
THE CAPTAIN'S FACE CHANGES IN THE TWILIGHT.
FOURTEEN years had passed since the disappearance of
the little Baronet, and during the whole of that period
Claribel Walsingham and her husband had remained
in undisturbed possession of Lislewood Park. Sir
Launcelot's agent, a solicitor resident in Lislewood,
collected the rents of the estate, and remitted them to
the Baronet's bankers at Florence. It was to the
simple inhabitants of the little village as if the house
of Lislewood were indeed extinct, now that its chief no
longer resided on the estate. Fourteen years had
glided by, unmarked by change, except that, indeed,
the birth of another son had come to console the un.
happy lady, and the light of bright baby eyes had
shone upon the darkened room, in which the bereaved
mother mourned for her first-born. Four months after
the loss of Sir Rupert, the Lislewood doctors had come
to the Captain-sitting, pale and anxious, by the fire
in the library-to tell him that he was the father of a
son, a noble boy, with dark-brown eyes, like his own,
a boy, who by-and-by grew up to be the delight of the
great house, whereof the splendour had been so deso-
late before ; a boy, whose childish laughter echoed
through the long corridors, whose merry voice rang,

fresh and clear, under the spreading branches of the
stately oaks; a mischievous noisy brave frank reck-
less boy ; very much like what the Captain had been
in those early days when he fell over head and ears in
love with Miss Claribel Merton. The Indian officer
loved his son with an intense devotion. He interested
himself in all his childish amusements ; his pony, his
gun, the boat in which he rowed about the ornamental
sheet of water. The father was never tired of hearing
the lad talk, never weary of riding with him about the
bare Sussex downs. When the boy went to Eton, the
father grieved more at the separation than Claribel
herself. “If anything should happen to him; if any.
thing should happen, Claribel !” he said. These
ominous words filled the mother's heart with such wild
terror, that she would have sent an express after the
boy, to bring him back to Lislewood, had not the
Captain prevented her.
"He is in the hands of Providence, Claribel. I could
not save your other son, though, Heaven knows, I was
honest in my love for him."
So the boy went to Eton, where his frank generous
daring nature made him generally beloved ; and the
Captain and his wife were once more alone in the great
house at Lislewood. The boy had been away for two
years, returning only for his vacations; to the arrival
of which periods the father always looked forward with
childish impatience. The servants at the park began
to see a change in the appearance of the handsome
Indian officer. He had grown stout, and his thick
dark hair was streaked with grey. He stooped as he
walked, and leaned every day more heavily upon his
gold-handled cane. At five-and-forty years of age he
looked almost an old man; while his fair-haired wife
scarcely seemed a year older than on the day of her
second marriage. Major Varney and his beautiful wife
had returned to India at the expiration of that officer's
furlough, and Arthur Walsingham had heard very seldom
from his golden-whiskered friend. The lodge at the great

gates was all the pleasanter to look at, now that the
awkward shadow of the skulking poacher no longer fel?
across the garden path. A red-faced little man, who
had failed as a butcher in the village of Lislewood, now
kept the lodge, and half a dozen rosy-faced children
looked through the gate out of which little James
Arnold's pale face had peered years before.
In a June twilight the Captain and his wife sat to-
gether in the long drawing-room. He lounged in a low
easy-chair by one of the windows. He was smoking,
as usual, and looked, with dreamy and thoughtful eyes,
out upon the wide sweep of garden and park that lay
before him. Mrs. Walsingham was seated at some dis-
tance from him, with her head bent over a piece of
embroidery. He finished his cigar, and then, sighing
heavily, turned his head towards the sofa upon which
his wife was seated.
“ Claribel,” he said, “throw away that foolish em-
broidery, and tell me how long we have been married.”
“Fourteen years last February.”
“ Fourteen years! And if your son, Sir Rupert, had
lived, he would have come of age- ?"
"Next month. His birthday was on the third of
July.”
" The third of July, and this is the fourth of June.
In twenty-nine days from this time he would have come
of age, had he lived, poor child !”
Mrs. Walsingham put away her work, with a sigh.
“I do wrong to talk to you of this, Claribel ; it
makes you unhappy-does it not? But I feel to-night,
a strange inclination to talk of these things, and to
review my past life-to look back, and see what a bitter
mistake it has been from first to last. I wonder, as I
remember what a reckless creature of impulse I have
been-I wonder at the energies wasted, the talents
misapplied, the sorrow and disgrace "
“ Arthur, Arthur!”
“ Claribel, we have lived together for nearly fifteen
years, and never once during that period have you asked

me what this cloud is, which has overshadowed all my
life; not once have you questioned me as to this dreary
secret, the influence of which has made me a gloomy
and neglectful husband, à discontented and unhappy
man."
“I have never dared to ask you, Arthur.”
“Poor child! Better that it should be so, Claribel ;
better, far better, that I should die with my story
untold. You will bury me in the Lislewood vault,
will you not, Claribel ? and you will put up a marble
tablet in the chancel, setting forth that I have been the
best of husbands and the most faultless of men. Will
you do as much for me as that, my fair-haired darling ?”
“ Arthur, how can you talk like this?”.
“Because, Claribel, I have long had the conviction
that I should not live to the age of fifty, and because
that conviction is stronger upon me to-night than it has
ever been yet.”
“ Arthur!” Mrs. Walsingham rose from her seat,
with a look of alarm in her face, and crossed the room
to the window where the Captain sat.
“Go back to your place, and sit down, Claribel. If I
am to leave you soon, if the ringing noises which I so
often have in my ears, the painful lights which glance
before my eyes, the dull heavy pain in my head, the
strange choking sensation in my throat-if all these
symptoms, which are worse to-night than usual, mean
what I think they mean, I shall most likely die very
suddenly. Be a tender mother to my boy, Claribel ; and
remember me with pity when I am gone.”
“Arthur, how cruel you are! you have been suffering
all this ; you have had all these alarming symptoms,
and you have never consulted a physician ; you, who
know how precious your life is to me.”
“ Is it, Claribel ? What have I ever been to you but
a dreary burden, a spiritless moody wretch, a sponge
upon your fortune, an intruder in your house ? Claribel,
shall I tell you the story of a young fellow in my
regiment, who in some things resembled myself? Ă

Lady Lisle.
melancholy story, but a painfully true one! Will you
hear it?"
“Yes."
The room was half in shadow; but the setting sun
shone full upon the dark face of the Captain, as he
commenced his story. He did not look at his wife, but
he fixed his eyes on the purple horizon of the wood
before him.
“Like myself, Claribel, this man was an orphan; a
younger son of a good old Somersetshire family, with
no nearer relations to help him than a half-brother of
his dead father, who thought, when he sent his nephew
to Addiscombe, and got him a cadetship, that he had
done all that was necessary to insure his success in life.
The penniless cadet went out to India very young, very
reckless, very brave, and very poor. When he sailed,
he was accounted one of the handsomest lads that had
ever left Addiscombe. Well, he fought, as they said,
like a devil. He won his promotion at a very early age,
and returned to England after having obtained his
captaincy. In England he fell in love, as I did, with a
woman, who, after giving him enough tacit encourage-
ment to madden him with love for her, jilted him as
heartlessly as (forgive me, Claribel) you jilted me. He
left her, as I left you, a madman-desperate, furious,
and despairing; only restrained from blowing out his
brains by some vague idea of a cruel vengeance in
future. On his return to his regiment, he stopped at
Southampton for a day or two, before the vessel which
was to carry him out set sail. Others were with him,
as reckless as himself. He had recourse to the coward's
usual consolation-he drank furiously; and, on the
night of his arrival, after a dinner at which he had
drunk more than any man at the table, he went with his
brother officers to the theatre.
“He has often described to me, Claribel, his feelings
on that night. It was past ten o'clock when he entered
the dusty half-empty boxes of the little provincial play-
house. The drop-scene was down, and the painted

figures upon it reeled as he looked at them. The music
rang in his ears with a hideous metallic sound, that
seemed to drive him mad. He heard the laughter of
his companions; he saw the painted faces of the women
in the tier above him simpering down at the tipsy
officers; and, in the midst of all, he dropped his head
forward upon the shabby velvet cushion before him, and
fell fast asleep. When he awoke, the curtain was up,
and the audience were applauding vociferously, while
the orchestra played the concluding chords of the ac-
companiment to a song. He looked straight before him
at the little stage, with its scanty row of flaring lights
and its dingy ill-painted scenery, and upon it he saw
the loveliest creature he had ever beheld in his life. I
will not weary you with a long description of this
woman, Claribel ; it is enough to tell you that her
beauty was of that brilliant and dazzling nature which
attracts every eye, and is almost bewildering to the
senses from its glorious splendour. She was dressed in
some masculine costume, with a tunic of velvet and
satin, tiny boots of yellow morocco, a sword, a cap, a
pluine of waving feathers, and a quantity of golden
fringes, which glittered and flashed in the gaslight. In
every attitude which she assumed, she made a picture
which a painter might have envied, but could scarcely
have achieved. She had been singing, and in the
course of the piece, which was a vaudeville, she sang
again. Her voice was superb; rich and powerful,
flexible and highly cultivated. When my friend left
the theatre, he thought that he was mad or bewitched.
He rushed to his hotel, and wrote the beautiful actress
a passionate love-letter. The next day he forced his
way behind the scenes, and saw her in the broad glare
of the morning sun. She was lovelier by daylight, if
possible, than she had been at night, for her beauty was
more subdued. O Claribel! this is altogether such a
shameful story, that I scarcely know how to tell it.
Enough, that this woman was a Circe, a wicked
magician, who left her victims to lament her fatal

beauty, after having traded on their folly, and dis a
counted their madness to the uttermost farthing. She
was a woman who would have sold herself to Beelzebub
for the lucre which was the one passion of her pitiless
nature. The young officer knew nothing of this : he
only knew that she was the loveliest creature he had
ever beheld. The vessel in which he was to sail was to
leave Southampton in three days, and on the second he
fell on his knees at the siren's feet, and implored her to
marry him the next morning, in order that she might
accompany him to India. Remember, Claribel, that
love had nothing to do with this fresh madness. Per-
haps in all his admiration of the peerless beauty of the
actress, the thought which was uppermost in the
soldier's mind was, the desire of revenge upon the
woman who had jilted him. He hurried up to London,
procured a special licence, flew back in the dead of the
night to Southampton, and married the provincial
actress upon the morning on which he was to sail.
Leaving the church, with his bride hanging upon his
arm, he met an old East Indian colonel, whom he had
known years before in Calcutta. This man was a
resident in Southampton. He questioned the young
officer, on seeing him with his bride upon his arm, got
from him the whole of the story, and then, taking him
to his own house, told him— the hideous truth! The
old man told him, Claribel, who and what this woman
was, whom he had sworn at God's altar to love and
cherish. He told the wretched dupe the shame, the
remorse, the misery, which this marriage must inevito
ably bring upon him. The young man swore, by the
light in heaven, that he would never look upon the face
of his wife again. He gathered together the few bank-
notes which he possessed, and these, with his watch
and chain, his rings, and two or three other valuables,
he sealed in a packet, with a few scornful lines of
farewell. Having done this, and having given the
packet into the hands of the old colonel, he walked on
board his ship, and sailed for Calcutta. During the

voyage out he had a fever. He did see his wife again
years afterwards, but she then called herself the wife of
another man. He never acknowledged her, or by one
word confessed that she was more to him than the most
utter stranger; but he afterwards committed a crime,
which placed him in the power of a villain.”
“A crime?” said Claribel.
“Yes ; Heaven knows how cruelly he was tempted,
and how vainly he struggled against the temptation.
The woman who had jilted him became a widow. He
had never, even in the shame and madness of his fatal
marriage, ceased to love her. He returned to Eng.
land and married her; married her, knowing that
he was the lawful husband of another woman, and
that, at any hour, disgrace and ruin might fall upon
him. In the power of a wretch, who would have
wrung from him his heart's blood drop by drop, every
moment of his life was blackened by fear and remorse;
every smile of the woman he had deceived was a re-
proach to his guilty heart. Claribel, Claribel, tell me,
for mercy's sake! could you have forgiven such a man?
could you have pitied him ? could you have said to
him, 'Die in peace; rest in peace; I will remember
how much you have loved me, and forgive you for the
sake of that love !' Could you say this, Claribel ?”.
Mrs. Walsingham rose from her seat, pale and trem-
bling; she tottered towards the Captain, caught his
head in her arms, and drew it gently upon her breast.
“Arthur,” she said, in a low voice, whose tones
seemed unnaturally calm, “ Arthur, I forgive you. It
is your own story that you have been telling me. I
forgive you, my dear husband; I pity and I love you."
He lifted his head from her bosom, and, in the dim
summer twilight, she saw a change upon his face-an
awful and a ghastly change.
" Claribel—the boy, Rupert,” he gasped with a
painful effort, “ the boy is alive-Major Varney-ask-
ask " He tried to speak a great deal more than
this, but he only uttered inarticulate and unearthly

sounds, and as his wife shrieked aloud for help, he fell
heavily to the ground.
The servants, who rushed into the room at the sound
of Mrs. Walsingham's screams, found him lying in a
heap upon the carpet, with a white foam oozing from
his distorted lips. They lifted him in their arms, and
carried him into his own room, while a groom galloped
into Lislewood to fetch the surgeon. The Captain
never spoke again ; he lay for nearly four-and-twenty
hours in an unconscious state, and, at the end of that
time, expired without a groan. They had sent to
London for the best advice; but the two eminent
physicians who arrived at the park could do nothing
that the Lislewood surgeon had not attempted before
them. The Captain died, as he had often prophesied
that he should die, from an attack of apoplexy.
CHAPTER XII.
THE MAJOR BEGINS TO UNWIND THE TAITGLED SKEIN.
DURING that very summer in which Captain Arthur
Walsingham, of the Honourable East India Company's
service, fell suddenly at the feet of his terrified wife in
the drawing-room at Lislewood Park, a certain Mr.
Joseph Slogood was delighting and instructing the
small flock, congregated three times every Sunday in a
tiny stifling ill-built chapel, which was squeezed into
the corner of a narrow street leading out of the Old
Kent Road. It had been a builder's outhouse once,
this chapel ; it had been converted, by an adventurous
speculator, into a twopenny theatre, in which dreadful
men in pink fleshings and black velvet waistbands
ornamented with foil paper stars, had balanced basins,
and swords, and poles, and sometimes each other on
their chins and noses, for the delectation of the Old
Kent Road; but it had signally failed as a theatre,
and it failed as a shooting gallery, and failed after that

as a bazaar, till at last the builder lost temper with it,
and, having a slack week, set to work with spiteful
energy, and knocked and hammered and sawed away
at it, till he made it into a chapel, painted it a glaring
white picked out with stone-colour, and called it “Little
Beulah.”
But having built his chapel, and having furnished it
with an imitation-mahogany pulpit, in form very much
like a gigantic wine-glass, and having further divided
it into small square pews, with narrow seats hewn out
of the hardest wood he could find in his yard; having
done all this, the builder looked about him for a con-
gregation, out of whose pockets could be extracted, in
consideration of the privilege of sitting in the hard-
seated pews, an emolument which should remunerate
the speculator. After due deliberation, the builder
decided that the best way to get a congregation was
first to get a preacher. For a preacher he accordingly
sought, and was not long in finding what he wanted;
for in three weeks from the completion of the building,
the denizens of the immediate neighbourhood were
startled by hearing the gruff thunder of a bass voice
resounding out of the varnished wine-glass. People
went to hear the new preacher at first out of curiosity.
Many went away disgusted before he had finished the
rambling discourse which he called a sermon. Some
were so malicious as to talk about blasphemy, profanity,
and vulgarity, and to say that this man should be
forbidden to desecrate the Holy Word, which be pre-
tended to teach. But, on the other hand, a few servant-
girls, a fat tallow-chandler, pretty well to do in the
world, and two or three old women with small an-
nuities, pronounced the preacher to be a great man,
a new light. The servant-girls, indeed, went so far as
to call him “pious dear.”
There were, of course, numerous reports set afloat in
the neighbourhood of Little Beulah, as to where the
builder had met with the minister of this deal-and-
plaster tabernacle. Some said he had picked him np

in a public-house; others, that he had found him
fulfilling the onerous duties of supernumerary at the
Victoria Theatre; others, that he had discovered him
officiating as Cheap John, and had been struck with
his power of lungs as displayed in that capacity ; but
say what they would, his enemies were soon forced to
allow that Mr. Joseph Slogood, Independent minister,
was an established fact, and that the quarterly rents of
the hard-seated pews were beginning to fall pretty
regularly into the coffers of the enterprising builder.
A fortnight after the death of Captain Arthur Wal.
singham, Mr. Joseph Slogood beguiled an unusually
hot Sunday afternoon by an unusually long sermon.
The tallow-chandler, the servant-girls, and the old
women with annuities, sat meekly perspiring beneath
the afternoon sun, glaring fiercely in through the sky-
light above their heads. Mr. Slogood, getting warmer
with every nasal period, hurled denunciation after
denunciation upon the innocent bald head of the trades-
man and the smart Sunday bonnets of the servant
girls. He banged the dust out of the flaring red velvet
cushion, and sent it floating in sunny motes across the
little chapel. He divided his sermon into heads, he
rambled, he repeated himself, he contradicted himself,
with inexhaustible energy. He was a gaunt broad-
shouldered man, with an habitual stoop. He had a
pale swarthy face, dark hair, and strange light-coloured
eyes-eyes of a yellowish green, which changed in the
sunshine like the eyes of a cat. The reader will recog-
nize the preacher by these ugly suspicious cat-like
eyes. He is very much changed, however, this Mr.
Joseph Slogood. He wears a black dress-coat, a great
deal of white shirt-front, and an open collar showing
an expanse of blue unshaven throat and chin ; but his
hands are no cleaner than they were when he smoked
his clay pipe in the shadows of the lodge at Lislewood
Park, and though he has a blustering confident way,
which he had not then, he has still something of the
old taint upon him. He has it to-day at the close of

his sermon, when he hears the door of the little chapel
open, and, looking towards it, sees a gentleman stand-
ing upon the threshold. The congregation also hear
the opening of the chapel door, and every head is turned
to see who this audacious intruder can be who dares to
enter at such a time. He does not advance into the
little aisle, but stands within the doorway, as if wait.
ing for the end of Mr. Slogood's sermon. The broad
glare of the summer sun shines full upon him, full upon
his yellow moustache and whiskers, his gold chains and
glistening ornaments, his light overcoat, his shining
boots, and his Malacca cane. The intruder is no less
a person than Major Granville Varney. He looks a
little older than when we saw him last, and a good deal
stouter; but now, as then, from head to foot he is all
gold, and glitter, and dazzle.
Mr. Joseph Slogood winds up his sermon rather
abruptly. He shuffles over his last sixteen heads in
less than sixteen sentences; his clerk, the apprentice
of a neighbouring shoemaker, gives out homoeopathic
doses of a long lugubrious hymn; after which Mr.
Slogood dismisses his congregation, comes creaking
down the pulpit staircase, joins the yellow-moustachioed
intruder at the doorway, and follows him respectfully
out of the chapel.
“ So this is how you amuse yourself, Mr. — ," says
the stranger.
“Slogood, sir," the minister suggests.
“Slogood. A new name, and a new occupation.
You find the old tract-reading at Lislewood useful to
you, I see. The sermon was most interesting. Do
they give you much for this sort of thing?”.
“Little enough, sir; but it helps out the little incomo

“From that rich brother of yours, eh, Slogood ? Be
so kind as always to remember that I know nothing of
your income. It might be thirty thousand a year; it
might be thirty shillings a week. Remember, I can
know nothing whatever about it."

“You're rather hard upon a man, Major," growled
Mr. Slogood, glancing furtively at the yellow mous-
taches, and the twinkling blue eyes, which were looking
full at him, as the two men walked away from the
chapel.
“ I'm rather hard upon a man, my good Slogood.?
What can you mean by such an assertion? I have
nothing whatever to do with you,-I abjure all know-
ledge of you. Let them place you in a witness-box to-
morrow, and what can you say of me? Nothing ! Mr.
Josiah-no, Joseph Slogood, that is my grand principle.
In all my dealings with my fellow-men, the question
which I mentally ask myself is this: 'What could that
individual say of me in a witness-box? Nothing!
Good; then I am safe with him.' Now, my worthy
friend, I should like to see that boy of yours. My
servant, Salamons, tells me he's a wonderful fellow.
Let me have a look at him."
“ You want to- " hesitated Mr. Slogood, this time
looking very earnestly at the Major.
“I want to see the boy. For Heaven's sake, Mr.
Slogood, don't look for hidden meanings in the simplest
of phrases. I repeat, let me see the boy."
Mr. Slogood bowed, and turned into a narrow street,
at the end of that in which the chapel was situated.
He opened the door of a small house in this street, and
walked straight into a little parlour, closely followed
by the Major. A woman with fair hair and pinched
worn features was busy arranging a tea-table near the
window.
“He's upstairs, Major Varney. I've always kept
him select, according to directions."
“Not my directions, remember,” replied the Major.
“I have nothing to do with your keeping him
select."
Mr. Slogood made no reply to this, but in the half
obscurity of the little passage the cat-like eyes looked
rather savagely at the Major, who followed his host up
the staircase into the back room on the first floor,

At a small table by the window sat a young man of
about twenty years of age. He had a newspaper in
his hand, but he was looking listlessly into the yard
below, where some children were at play. Before him
on the table lay two or three half-smoked cigars, and a
heap of cheap periodicals of the lowest order, crumpled
and dirty. There was a pack of cards on the mantel-
piece, a box of dominos, two or three old playbills, and
some dirty kid gloves which had once been white. The
young man did not look up as Mr. Slogood entered the
room, but without taking his eyes from the children in
the yard below, said, in a peeyish discontented voice,
“O, it's you, is it? You've come back at last, and I
suppose you're going to let me out of this hole for a bit
this broiling afternoon.”
Mr. Slogood was about to speak, but the Major
brushed him aside with a wave of his hand.
“My dear young friend,” he murmured softly, gazing
at the young man with an expression of supreme com-
passion, “they don't treat you well—they don't treat
you well."
The dear young friend sprang from his chair with a
bound, and faced the Major. His pale sickly face lighted
up at the sight of the fat rosy cheeks and the shining
yellow moustache.
“At last,” he exclaimed,—"you've come at last. I'm
sick of this hole, I'm sick of all this juggling and con-
juring. Who am I, and what am I, and what's the
difference between me and other people ?”
The young man's face flushed with a faint unhealthy
crimson as he spoke. His pale blue eyes dilated, and
his thin bloodless lips quivered nervously. The Major
watched him with a smile, nodded gently, and murmured
to himself, “ Salamons is very clever, Alfred Salamons
is a great creature.”
" Tell me," repeated the young man," tell me, can't
you? who am I, and what does it all mean?”
“Sit down, dear boy," said the Major, entreatingly.
The young man obeyed, and the Major placed himself

by his side at the little table, while Mr. Slogood looked
on with a stupefied expression of countenance. “You
ask me,” said Major Varney, laying his hand affec-
tionately upon that of the young man,-"you ask me
who you are, what you are, and what this all means,
My dear boy, those three questions involve a great deal,
and I am not yet in a position to answer them. But I
am struggling towards that position,--I am working
towards it. The light is a long time coming, but I
think I see a little glimmer in the horizon, I really
think I do, dear boy."
“Bother the horizon !" said the boy, peevishly; "why
can't you give a straight answer? Why can't anybody
give me a straight answer to a straight question ? If
I ask him anything,” he added, pointing to Mr. Slogood,
“ what do I get ? Why, juggling with words, and pre-
varication, and mystification. If I ask that Jew man,
who's always hanging about here (I like him, though,
for he's about the best friend I've got)-if I ask him a
question, it's the same, always the same. You're every
one of you in a plot to keep me in the dark. Every one
of you,” he repeated, passionately.
The Major patted the young man's hand gently with
his own. “Except me-always excepting me. I am in
no plot, poor child. How should I be in any plot? But
I think I've found the clue to one, and I shall do my
best to unravel it.”
Mr. Slogood started, and made as if he would have
spoken; the Major's blue eyes fixed themselves upon
him, and seemed to glue the words to his lips.
"Look at that man!” said the Major, pointing to
Mr. Slogood. “You've been taught to call him your
father, haven't you, and you've been willing to acknow-
ledge him as your father until very lately. Suppose,
now, that that man had been guilty of a great crime
towards you, poor helpless child! A crime which has
not only cruelly affected your early youth, but which
has blighted the best years of one to whom you were
most dear. Suppose this were the case, my dearest

boy; and that I, in the interest of that person to whom
you were once so dear, am determined upon unravelling
this mysterious and terrible plot, of which you, inno-
cent child, have been the victim.”
Throughout this speech the Major had not once dis-
continued affectionately patting the young man's hand,
nor had he once removed his eyes from the face of Mr.
Slogood. That worthy individual's countenance had
indeed afforded a study for the physiognomist. Surprise,
terror, fury, mystification, had succeeded one another
at every word that fell from the lips of the Indian
officer; and as Major Varney left off speaking, Mr.
Slogood exclaimed with vehemence,-
"I say, hold hard there, will you ! there's a slight
mistake "
Before he could utter another word, the Major ar-
rested him by a significant gesture, and the flexible
womanly lips under the yellow moustache slowly shaped
the syllables of a name, “ Jo-si-ah Bird!” Mr. Slogood
slunk away to the other end of the little room, and,
seating himself upon the bed, drew out a pocket Bible,
and affected to read. The young man had watched
all this with feverish impatience; he clutched Major
Varney's wrist, and exclaimed eagerly,-
“What plot ?—what is it? Tell me! tell me!”
“Not yet, dear boy; you must be patient. Trust in
me—your friend, your preserver. It shall be my task
to restore you to name and fortune; better still, my
child, it shall be my sacred duty to restore you to the
arms of a mother. We must get at this inscrutable
mystery the best way we can. If that man there is to
be bought, why, we must buy him. We shall not wish
to be hard upon him-far be it from us to desire to
punish. All we want is to arrive at the truth. For
that end we must be patient. Do you believe in me,
dear boy?”
“Yes !” cried the young man, eagerly.
“You believe me to be your friend, your benefactor,
your preserver--without whom you might rot in this

dismal bedroom—through whom you may be restored
to your rights, your rank, your fortune ?”
• What rights? What fortune ?"
“Never mind. Do you believe all this? Yes or no!”
“ Yes! yes!”
“Good; then for the present, good-bye. In a day or
two, expect to see me. Now, Mr. Slogood, be so kind
as to show me downstairs."
The young man caught the Major's hand in his own,
and pressed it to his lips. He would fain have detained
that gentleman, but Granville Varney would not be
detained. Mr. Slogood followed his visitor downstairs,
and in the passage said abruptly,-.
“What does it all mean? I'm not going to be made
a tool of like this! What does it mean ?"
“Mischief, if you attempt to interfere with other
people's plans; your advantage, if you keep your coun-
sel, and mind the lessons Mr. Salamons will set you.
You're not going to be made a tool of !” exclaimed the
Major, scornfully. "Why, what are you fit for but a
tool? What have you been from first to last, but a tool
a poor ignorant blind stupid blundering tool, with
neither wit to help yourself nor others ? Take care
what you're about, and you'll be well paid for your work.
Interfere with your employers, and you'll hear of Josiah
Bird! Good afternoon, my worthy Slogood.”
The Major sauntered away through the little street.
People came to the windows to see him pass; he was
as glorious as the afternoon sun sloping westwards in
golden splendour; the children followed him into the
Old Kent Road and looked on with gratification while
he took a hansom cab, and went home to cherish the
memory of him as a radiant vision of magnificent man.

CHAPTER XIII.
THE ADVERTISEMENT.
Two or three days after the Sunday on which Major
Varney had visited the Old Kent Road, that accom-
plished officer sat at breakfast with his wife in the
elegantly appointed dining-room of a small house in
Kensington Gore. Mrs. Varney's complexion has grown
a shade sallower within the fourteen years which have
elapsed since last we saw her, but the large dark eyes
are as resplendent as ever, and the luxuriant hair clus-
ters in the same wavy masses round her oval face. She
does not, however, look very amiable this morning.
She has eaten nothing; but she amuses herself by de.
stroying the delicate outer wall of a páté de foie gras.
It seems almost as if she took a savage delight in the
occupation; and the shining knife, clasped in the ner-
vous little hand, has something the look of a dagger.
Perhaps Mrs. Varney thinks this herself; for she says
presently, as her eyes follow every flash of the glittering
steel,-
“How hard it is that one mustn't stab somebody
every morning before breakfast! If I were a Russian
princess, with two or three thousand slaves of my own,
I would murder one every day to put me in good
humour. It would be better than hock and seltzer
water. Granville Varney, I am miserably tired of my
life. I wish I were a player on the Southampton stage!
I wish I were counting the checks, and casting the
pieces, and patching up my yellow boots, and rehears-
ing stupid songs to sing to stupid half-tipsy cadets !
I wish I were young again, and "
“Innocent," said the Major, twisting his moustaches,
and stirring half a dozen lumps of sugar into his tea.
“I say I'm sick of this hand-to-mouth existence. I'm
tired of this struggle to keep up a great appearance
upon uncertain means. We are getting old, Granville
- it is time we should retire upon our fortune."

Lady Lisle.
“Right, my Adeline! Every word is worthy of a
philosopher. We will retire upon our fortune.”
“What do you mean, Granville ? We have nothing
but your pay, and the miserable chances of card-playing,
and the race-course "
“ To-day, no; in a month from this, yes. I am tired
of the service, my Adeline. I shall never go back to
India, but I shall establish myself in an agreeable coun-
try retreat, where I shall spend—with you, of course,
my angel—the remainder of my peaceful days. What
a blessing it is to have nothing in one's life to repent
of! How clear is the conscience of a man who has
never committed a punishable offence! We will throw
ourselves upon the generous hospitality of our friend,
Sir Rupert Lisle.”
Mrs. Varney's black eyes opened to their widest
extent.
“ Sir Rupert- ?”
“Lisle," said the Major. “That injured young man
will have to thank me for his restoration to name and
fortune. Poor dear child! he had very nearly fallen the
victim to an infamous conspiracy."
“But,” exclaimed Mrs. Varney," you will never "
“Suffer the poor boy to be separated from his devoted
mother, to be deprived of his place in life, to be robbed
even of his name amongst men. No, my Adeline,
never !” said the Major, pulling his moustache, in a
transport of virtuous indignation.
“I wish, Varney, you'd leave off acting when you're
alone with me," said the lady, impatiently.
“Acting, my Adeline! When do I act ? When do
I ever require to act? I have no crimes to conceal, my
dear love. I make a discovery that a certain young
man has been from his childhood the victim of a vile
conspiracy—and what do I do? Why, I immediately
set to work to discover the details of that conspiracy.
When I have accomplished that task, I shall blazon my
discovery to the world. I need not tell you that the
young man will be eternally grateful to me. Again, I

117
need not tell you that I shall make good use of that
gratitude."
“But people are not always grateful to their benefac-
tors," said Mrs. Varney
“Not all people, certainly, Adeline. Indeed, I believe
the majority of individuals lean the other way. But I
am not afraid of Sir Rupert Lisle."
“You think he will be better than the majority ?"
Mrs. Varney asked, with rather a scornful smile.
“I say I am not afraid of him, my Adeline. I say
nothing more. He may be the worst or the best of
men; but I am not afraid of him. If he should prove
the worst, I should be, perhaps, still less afraid of
him.”
“I don't care about guessing enigmas, Major
Varney."
“No, dearest, and you are scarcely clever enough for
the task. Its pretty mouth was never made to answer
nasty puzzling riddles -- was it ? My Adeline, you
were never intended for anything but to look hand-
some, sing songs, and spend money. You have looked
handsome, spent songs, and sung money-I beg your
pardon, sung songs, and spent money-all your life.
You have therefore fulfilled your destiny. Do not
attempt to go beyond it. The creative brain is here ! ”
exclaimed the Major, tapping his forehead with an egg-
spoon.
His handsome wife shrugged her shoulders impa-
tiently, and took up the Times Supplement, which the
Major had been reading
“Look a little to the right of the Births, Marriages
and Deaths, and tell me what you see.”
“Ah!” cried Mrs. Varney, as her eye caught the
first words of an advertisement at the top of the second
column. " What does this mean?”
“ Read it aloud, Adeline, and I will tell you."
“Should this meet the eye of Major Granville Var-
ney, H.E.I.C.S., or of any person acquainted with that
gentleman's present address, they are most earnestly

solicited to communicate with Messrs. Selbourne and
Selbourne, Solicitors, Gray's Inn Place.”
“What does it mean, Granville ?”
“ Shall I show you how I mean to answer it?" asked
the Major.
“ Yes.”
Major Varney rose from the table, and seating him-
self at a carved oak desk near the window, he wrote a
few rapid lines, and handing them to his wife, addressed
an envelope while she read them.
The few lines the Major had written ran thus :-
“14, Kensington Gore, June 30th, 184,
“ MY DEAR MADAM,-I remember that Messrs. Sel-
bourne and Selbourne, of Gray's Inn, were, some years
ago, the lawyers employed by your family, and it has
occurred to me as just possible that the advertisement
in to-day's Times may emanate from yourself. If it
should be so, and if there should be any way, however
remote, in which I can serve you, pray command me.
If it should not be so, pardon me for the trouble I
have given you. I have such a terrible antipathy to
lawyers, that I prefer the hazard of boring you with
this letter to the alternative of putting myself into
communication with gentlemen of that profession.
“I have the honour to be, my dear madam,
“Your very obedient servant,
“ GRANVILLE VARNEY."
“Why should you imagine that advertisement to be
inserted by Mrs. Walsingham ?” asked Mrs. Varney,
as she handed the letter back to the Major.
“Because I have been waiting for its insertion ever
since the death of Arthur Walsingham. I thought it
more than probable that on his death-bed he would
reveal a certain secret. If he did so, well and good.
Mrs. Walsingham would seek me out, and I was pre-
pared to receive her. If, on the contrary, he died and
made no sign, it would be necessary for me to take the
initiative, and seek out Mrs. Walsingham. This adver-

119
tisement, for which I have been looking anxiously
every day, convinces me that my poor foolish Arthur
spoke before he died. Dear boy, it was like him to
speak-it was like him to die; he has always been
consistent, and he has been very useful to me. O
Adeline! no man would ever commit a punishable
offence, if he knew what a nice little income may be
made out of the peccadilloes of other people.”
The Major had not to wait long for an answer to his
letter. Early the next morning, a brougham drove to
the door, and Mr. Salamons, who acted as valet, butler,
and general factotum, brought his master Mrs. Wal-
singham's card.
The Major told his servant to show the lady into the
library, a tiny room opening into a tiny garden, where
there were a few evergreens, a fountain, and some gold
fish swimming languidly in a shallow stone basin.
Before joining his visitor, Major Varney took a little
looking-glass from his waistcoat pocket, and thought-
fully arranged his moustache.
"Moustaches are not benevolent-looking,” he said,
musingly. “It would have been wiser, perhaps, to
have shaved my face and let my hair grow long before
things came to a crisis. And yet the light moustaches
look débonnaire. I think I shall make her trust me."
He found Mrs. Walsingham standing near the open
window, with her eyes fixed upon the door by which he
entered. She was very pale, but she did not look
much older than when he had last seen her
“Mrs. Walsingham," he said, holding out both his
hands, " then my instincts did not deceive me. The
advertisement did emanate from you. And you come
to command my services. This is kind of you. I have
only just returned from India, and I only learned a day
or two ago that my poor old friend was-
She interrupted him here, and with an agitation she
was unable to conceal, she began to speak.
- Major Varney! Major Varney! I come to you on
no common business I should have sought you out

So
before this, but the grief, the shock of-of" sho
hesitated, and a vivid blush crimsoned her pale face for
one brief moment" of Captain Walsingham's death
rendered me powerless even to think. My lawyers
have been strongly opposed to my holding any personal
communication with you; they know nothing of this
visit; but I hazard all in order to ask you one question.
You may have been my worst enemy; you may be
determined to be so still. My brain is not able to
endure the conflicting doubts by which it has been
tortured for the last three weeks. Major Varney, I ask
you, by the love you must once have felt for your own
mother, to answer me one question.” She fell on her
knees at his feet, and lifted her clasped hands towards
him as she spoke. “Tell me, for pity's sake, is my
son, Sir Rupert Lisle, still living?"
The Major opened his eyes so wide, that there
seemed some risk of his being unable to shut them
again, as Mrs. Walsingham asked this question. He
raised her gently from the ground, and placed her in a
chair.
“For Heaven's sake,” he said, “calm yourself, my
dear madam, I entreat, I implore. You bewilder me.
What is the cause of this hallucination ?”
“It is no hallucination,” she said. “ Captain Wal-
singham, only a few moments before the fatal stroke
which terminated his life, endeavoured to reveal a
secret "
"He endeavoured ?" said the Major, rather anxiously.
“He was only able to utter a few broken words, but
those words were enough to tell me that my son Rupert
was not dead, and that you knew something of the
secret."
“My dear madam, be good enough to remember how
utterly improbable that is. I have been in India from
the time of the disappearance of your son until within
this last month. My poor friend's brain was perhaps
affected. How unlikely that your son should be alive!
What motive could Captain Walsingham have had in

121
concealing the fact from you? What could he gain by
the commission of such a crime?"
“Nothing, nothing. My poor child's fortune died
with him."
“Then what motive could any one have in concealing
the fact of his existence, if he did still exist ? My
dear madam, this is very strange, very perplexing. I
scarcely dare tell you how strange it is to me.”
There was some slight confusion in the Major's man.
ner as he said these last words, and he looked at Mrs.
Walsingham with singular earnestness.
“You scarcely dare tell me,” she exclaimed. “O for
pity's sake tell me what you mean. You are keeping
something from me; you know something which you
will not tell me. I am convinced that you do.”
“No, no," said the Major, walking up and down the
room, as if lost in thought, “it is so unlikely, so in-
credible, so-so impossible."
“Major Varney, for mercy's sake, speak out! Re-
member that this is a matter of life and death to me.
You shall not find me ungrateful. If you know any.
thing of my poor child, if you will aid me to restore
him to name and fortune, half that fortune shall be
yours.” .
The Major started as if some one had struck him,
drew himself to his fullest height, and, looking at Mrs.
Walsingham with a freezing expression, said, with
haughty earnestness, –
“Mrs. Walsingham, I would recommend you never
again to offer a bribe to an officer in the Honourable
East India Company's service, and I should also advise
you not to dispose of your son's fortune. If he were
alive, he would soon be of age, and would like to do
that himself.”
“Forgive me," she said. “I am half distracted.
Forgive me; and tell me what it is that is in your mind
about my lost boy.”
The Major did not answer. He walked up and down
the room, still absorbed in thought. Presently he .

stopped suddenly. “Mrs. Walsingham," he said, “have
you a portrait of Sir Rupert Lisle in your possession?"
The widow unfastened her shawl, removed a slender
gold chain from her neck, and placed the locket which
was attached to it in the Major's hand. This locket
contained a miniature of Sir Rupert painted upon
ivory, and taken a year before the disappearance of
the boy.
The Major looked at it with a long and earnest scru.
tiny. He walked to the window, and stood for several
minutes examining the miniature.
“Mrs. Walsingham," he said earnestly, “Heaven
knows how fearful I am of uttering one word calcu-
lated to mislead you in such a matter as this; but,” he
added, with a sudden energy, “as sure as there is light
in the sky above us, I think that your son is alive.”.
Claribel's cheeks, so pale before, blanched to an awful
whiteness, as she slowly slid from her chair and feli
senseless on the carpet.
CHAPTER XIV.
MAJOR VARNEY APPEARS AS A PHILANTHROPIST.
“This is awkward,” said the Major gravely, as his
visitor fell fainting at his feet. “Poor thing! and all
this about a pale-faced child. Who would ever think
that there was so much sickly sentimentality in the
world? Shall I call Ada to her? No; that might be
dangerous. Who knows what that foolish Arthur may
not have confessed?"
The Major rang the bell, which was answered with
exemplary promptitude by Mr. Salamons.
“ Send Mrs. Varney's maid here with hartshorn, cold
water, and all the restorative paraphernalia,” said the
Major; “Mrs. Walsingham has fainted.”
A little aromatic vinegar held to the nostrils of the
• Major's visitor quickly revived her. They lifted her

into her chair, and wheeled it to the open window.
She looked round for a moment with a bewildered
expression, but on seeing the Major she remembered
everything. Like all quiet people, she evinced a great
power of self-command.
"I am better, thank you,” she said. “It was very
foolish of me to faint. I need not trouble you any
more," she added to Mr. Salamons and the lady's maid,
“I shall be glad to continue our conversation, Major
Varney, and will take care not to interrupt you so
foolishly again."
The servants withdrew, and Mrs. Walsingham and
the Major were once more alone. He was standing by
her chair; she caught his hand in both of hers, and
fixed her earnest eyes upon his face.
“Now,” she said, “for pity's sake, tell me the mean-
ing of your words. You had no right to utter them,
unless you are prepared to explain them.”
The Major drew a chair close to hers, and seated
himself by her side. “True, Mrs. Walsingham,” he
said ; “but I never in my life uttered a word which I
was not prepared to explain and to justify. If you will
promise to listen to me very quietly, you will see that I
have not done so to-day. Will you promise ?".
“Yes.” She never took her eyes from his face. His
bright blue eyes met hers, clear, radiant, and serene-
the eyes of a good man, who has a clear conscience, and
is not afraid of the world. Such to the physiognomist
might have seemed the eyes of Major Granville
Varney.
“I said to you just now (remember your promise)
that I believe your son to be alive. We are all of us,
at the best, so liable to error, so likely to be the victims
of self-deception even when we feel most positive, that
I must implore you to accept all I say with a certain
qualification."
“If you will only speak out, and speak plainly_-"
said Mrs. Walsingham, impatiently.
“My dear madam, I am about to do so. I told you


## p. 124 (#128) ############################################

124
Lady Lisle.
that I believed your son to be alive. I do so believe ;
but I must now tell you the slender foundation which I
have for that conviction."
“The slender foundation ?" she repeated anxiously.
6 Very slender, as you may think. Mrs. Walsing-
ham, I have a wonderful memory for faces. Heaven
help the native deserter whose misfortune it was to be
brought before Granville Varney! He might have been
only ten days in my regiment, he might have been
away for ten years, but I could remember every trick of
his face, every glance of his wicked black eyes. It is
fourteen years since I saw the face of your poor boy.
If he is alive, he has grown in those years from a child
to a man; but in spite of that change, it is my firm
belief that three weeks ago I saw and recognized him."
“Major Varney!"
“Remember your promise. Three weeks ago my
wife and myself were induced to accept a box at the
Olympic Theatre. Our box was a stage-box; we were
therefore very near the pit. The house was badly
attended, and the stalls were almost empty. Exactly
behind them, in the front row of the pit, sat a young
man, whose earnest attention to the performance
attracted my wife's notice. I looked at him. I do
not believe in ghosts, Mrs. Walsingham, or I should
have assuredly believed that night that I was looking
at the ghost of your son, Sir Rupert Lisle.”
The Major paused.
“Is this true ? is this true ?” asked Mrs. Walsing.
ham.
“Hear the sequel, dear madam, and be yourself the
judge. As I do not believe in ghosts, I said to myself,
this is a most extraordinary likeness; so extraordinary,
that I feel a strange desire to know the name of the
owner of that fair pale face. It is not a common face
amongst fair pale faces; and come what may, I will
know something more about it. Now I have a very
clever servant, Alfred Salamons, the man you saw just
now. Salamins was in the pit, ready to attend us homo.

wish you to take particular notice of that young man.'
All right, sir,' answered my servant; 'I should know
him by a likeness.' What likeness, Salamons ?' I
asked. “Why, a likeness to that little boy at Lislewood
Park, Sussex, sir,' he said. "Good, Salamons,' I an-
swered, for I always treat a good servant with perfect
confidence; 'that very likeness is my reason for wish-
ing to find out who the young man is. Follow him
home, my worthy Salamons, and learn all about him.'”
" And did he did he discover "
“My dear madam, you have no idea what a treasure
the creature is. He contrived to follow the boy home
to some dingy street ever so far down the Old Kent
Road. He contrived to find out his name. His name
is Slogood. His father is a Methodist preacher, and
has lived in the neighbourhood for some years. This
did not sound very promising; but, at any rate, I
resolved to go and look at the boy."
“And you went?”.
“Yes, I went the next day. I saw the young man's
father-the Methodist preacher—the Mr. Joseph Slo-
good ; and who do you think I recognized in that
person?"
“I cannot tell."
“ An old servant from Lislewood Park. The lodge-
keeper--the reformed poacher-whose name was Gilbert
-Gilbert "
" Arnold !"
“Yes, Gilbert Arnold. So here was a connection at
once established between the boy I had seen at the
theatre and Lislewood Park. But what was the nature
of that connection? That was the question. Now, you
may happen to remember, my dear Mrs. Walsingham,
that between your boy Sir Rupert and the little lodge-
keeper's son there was a sort of likeness, very trifling,
very undefined - a resemblance which lay chiefly,
perhaps, in the height, the colour of the hair, the

complexion; but still something of a likeness. Do
you remember it?"
Major Varney watched his visitor's face with singular
attention as he asked this question. “I cannot say
that I ever perceived any such resemblance,” she said
proudly; “I know some people have made the remark,
but I never myself could see any likeness whatever
between Arnold's child and my beloved son Sir Rupert
Lisle."
“You think not? and you should be the best judge.
Mr. Slogood, or Gilbert Arnold, or whatever I am to
call him, seemed by no means pleased to see me. He
was called by a false namema bad sign! He was angry
and annoyed at being recognized, even going so far as
to attempt to deny his identity-another bad sign!
When I told him I wanted to see his son, he prevari.
cated, he lied, and finally refused to let me see the boy.
Then I began to suspect him. I laid a trap for him,
got him out of the way, and had an interview with the
young man. Poor boy! poor injured innocent boy!
Whoever he is, and whatever he is, he is no son of
Gilbert Arnold's!”.
"O for pity's sake speak plainly !"
“I can say nothing plainer than this, Mrs. Walsing-
ham-I believe the young man now living with Gilbert
Arnold, the ex-poacher, the sham Methodist parson, to
be no son of his; I believe him to be the child of parents
in a superior rank of life, and I believe him to be the
victim of some diabolical plot, some hideous conspiracy,
at the bottom of which is Mr. Gilbert Arnold. This,
Mrs. Walsingham, is what I believe; and until you
yourself have seen the boy, I will say no more.”
"O let me see him! Take me to him, I implore
you! Now-this moment—this very moment! The
suspense will kill me!"
“My dear madam, I rely upon your Christian for
bearance-your self-control. This is not a matter in
which impulse can serve us. One rash step might de-
stroy all. Patience and caution are vitally necessary to

watch every look, and if after that you say to me,
• Granville Varney, that young man is my son, Sir
Rupert Lisle,' I will move heaven and earth to prove
the young man's identity to the world, and to reinstate
him in his rights. Until this is done, nothing can be
done, for this is our starting-point. Now, for you to
see the young man, Gilbert Arnold must be got out of
the way for an hour or two. My treasure Salamons
will manage that this very night, if you like. If I have
been mistaken, if I have caused you this grief and ex-
citement without avail, you must forgive me. If, on the
other hand, the last words spoken by my poor friend
concealed some strange mystery, and I am the means of

now, my dear madam, for a few hours' repose. I shall
send you some luncheon, and some very special Madeira,
which has made the voyage out as often as your humble
servant. I must beg and implore you to rest, and to
take some refreshment. You will need all your strength
this evening. For, remember, this evening you will
have to make a decision upon which our future course
must depend. Au revoir !"
The Major took both Mrs. Walsingham's hands in his
and pressed them affectionately. He looked so brim.

attachment to the cause of oppressed innocence, that the
most suspicious of women could scarcely have doubted
his integrity; and Claribel Walsingham had never sus-

with confiding earnestness, as to a guardian angel, and
as she looked, the sun, shining through a window be-
hind him, lit up his yellow hair, and seemed to encircle
bis handsome head with an aureole of golden light.
CHAPTER XV.
GILBERT ARNOLD IS MADE TO SPEAK.
The treasure, Mr. Alfred Salamons, managed matters so
well as to arrange his plans for getting the sham Metho-
dist preacher out of the way for an hour or so at dusk.
In the early evening, therefore, Mrs. Walsingham's quiet
dark-brown brougham, with the lady and the Major
seated inside, drove away from Kensington Gore on its
way to the Old Kent Road. Claribel was very pale,
and painfully nervous. She scarcely spoke, but kept
her eyes fixed on the dim streets through which the
carriage passed. Major Varney directed the coachman
to stop at the corner of the street in which Mr. Slogood's
tabernacle was situated. When he and Mrs. Walsingham
had alighted, he told the man to drive to the Brick-
layers' Arms, and wait till he was sent for.
“Now, Mrs. Walsingham,” said the Major, “be so
kind as to take my arm, and I will lead you to this man
Slogood's house. I thought it prudent to send the car-
riage away, in case your late lodge-keeper should return
while we are here. He would have recognized the
Lislewood liveries.”
Claribel Walsingham did not seem to have heard the
Major's remarks. She walked on in silence for a few
moments; but just as they turned the corner of the
street, she stopped suddenly, and laying her disengaged
hand on the Major's wrist, said to him with a feverish
energy,
“Major Varney, is the boy I am going to see my own
son? Is he ? Yes or no.”
The midsummer moon had risen, and her pale light

shone clear upon the handsome face of the Indian officer.
Mellowed by this calm radiance, his yellow whiskers
and moustache took a more chastened hue than in the
glare of the day. He looked at his interrogator with
a straight unflinching gaze, which had something of
solemnity in it, as he answered, -
“Mrs. Walsingham, you are a helpless woman, the
widow of my very dear friend, and I would not willingly
mislead you. As I am a soldier and a gentleman, I
believe he is.”
She sighed a sigh of relief, and hurried on.
“Do not hurry, my dear madam,” said her com-
panion; "we are there.” He stopped at the garden
gate, and rang a bell, which was answered by Mr. Alfred
Salamons.
"All right?" asked the Major.
“Yes, sir. He's gone to a tea-meeting up at Hamp-
stead. I brought him a note from the Reverend Presi.
dent of the Society for Promoting Social Harmony
amongst the Cherokee Indians, inviting him to speak at
the meeting. He can't be back under a couple of hours,
for he'll be rather pazzled to find out where the meet-
ing's held.”
“Good, my Salamons.—Is he not a treasure, Mrs.
Walsingham "
She did not answer him; her eyes were riveted on
the half-open door of the house in which she hoped to
look upon her lost son.
“Now, my dear madam," said the Major, “ follow
mo.”
He went into the passage, and led the way to the foot
of the stairs. Before ascending them he paused, and,
looking at Salamons significantly, said, - -
“And she the wife?”.
“O she's gone into the country to see some friends,"
answered his valet. “They're very fond of her, and I
dare say they'll keep her a long time.”
“Once more, good, my Salamons.”
The Major and Mrs. Walsingham went upstairs, fol-

lowed closely by Mr. Salamons, who stood in the shadow
of the doorway while his master and the lady entered
the room. The young man with the pale face and fair
hair had thrown himself upon the bed, and lay with his
head on his arm in a sound sleep. His flaxen hair,
which grew rather long, had fallen away from his low
narrow forehead. His clothes, though rather shabby,
were of the prevailing fashion, and such as only a gentle-
man's son would wear. His hands were white and
delicate. The room was lighted only by a miserable
tallow candle with a long wick, burning on the table by
the window. The Major pointed silently to the sleeper.
Mrs. Walsingham uttered a faint scream, and, rushing
to the bed, fell on her knees, and lifting the fair face in
her arms, kissed the young man's forehead passionately.
He awoke with a startled look in his widely-opened blue
eyes, and stared about him wildly. It was rather a
delicate regular face on which the widow looked so
tenderly, but it was a face that gave no promise of a
powerful intellect.
“My poor boy! my poor injured boy!” said Major
Varney, “ remember what I told you the other night,
and prepare yourself.”
“Yes, yes!” cried the young man; “yes, I know.
And you are my mother,” he added, turning to Clari-
bel; - and you have come to take me away from this
horrid place and that horrid man. You've come for
that-haven't you?” He spoke with fretful impatience,
and, rising from the bed, seemed as if he wanted to run
straight out of the house.
Mr. Salamons, standing at the half-open door, caught
him by the wrist, and stopped him.
“My dear sir,” he said, “ there's no hurry; there's no
hurry. Take it calmly."
"Well, Mrs. Walsingham,” said the Major, " tell me,
am I right?”
“You are,” she said, with a sigh. “If I am deceived,
the delusion is a very cruel one, and the disappointment
will be very bitter. I believe you are right, and that

you have restored me my son; but he is sadly changed
-my poor, poor unhappy boy!-sadly changed.”
“ Deprived of a mother's care for fourteen years ;
mewed up in this wretched room,--how can you
expect to find him otherwise ?” asked the Major,
gravely.
“My boy, my poor Rupert, come to me'' said Clari-
bel, holding out her arms.
The young man put his arms round her neck, and let
his head fall upon her shoulder, where he shed a few
feeblo toars.
“I want to go away from this place; I want to go
away,” he repeated.
"You shall, Rupert, you shall,” answered Claribel.
She drew him towards the door, and they were leaving
the room together, when the Major interposed,
“My dear Mrs. Walsingham-my dear madam! Good
heavens! do you know what you are doing? You are
going to take away this young man, who is, or is sup-
posed to be, the son of an old servant of yours, and you
are going, I suppose, straight into a court of justice, in
which you will assert that this very lad is your own
child, Sir Rupert Lisle, for fourteen years supposed to
be dead. For goodness' sake, let us know what we are
going to do! For the sake of equity, for my poor dead
friend's sake, let us have a little system in what we are
going to do! Mrs. Walsingham, a chair.”
He motioned her to a seat. She obeyed him mechani.
cally, and sat down.
“In the first place, my dear madam, and before we
stir a step in the matter, it is vitally necessary that we
have your declaration that you solemnly believe this
young man to be your son, Sir Rupert Lisle."
“I do believe it,” said Claribel.
“ Good! In the presence of myself, Alfred Salamons,
and the young man in question, you declare him to be,
to the best of your belief, your son. You are misled
by no chance likeness which Gilbert Arnold's own boy
may have borne to Sir Rupert Lisle ?"


## p. 132 (#136) ############################################

132
Lady Lisle.
“I never saw such a likeness, and I never believed in
the existence of any likeness between the boys."
“Good! Then we may safely conclude that we have
fallen upon the discovery of a conspiracy to keep your
son's existence concealed from yourself and the world.
For what motive, and by whose contrivance, that con-
spiracy has been carried on, we must discover by-
and-by. Two things are clear. First, that Gilbert
Arnold is in the plot; secondly, that he must be made
to speak. Salamons, you have helped us in this, and
you know something of the man. Will he speak to-
pight?”
As the Major asked this question, a ray of light
seemed to travel directly from his eyes into the oriental
optics of Mr. Alfred Salamons. It was as if an electric
telegraph had been set in motion.
“I think he will," answered the valet; “ to-night as
well as any time."
“Good!” said the Major, looking at his watch. “It
is now a quarter past ten; in half an hour the man will
most likely be back. You, Salamons, go to the nearest
police-office, and bring a couple of detectives. If we
put those two gentlemen in the front parlour, we may
find it easier to induce our friend to open his mouth."
Mr. Salamons bowed, and departed on his errand.
Claribel and the Major sat waiting for the poacher's
return. The young man paced up and down the room,
stopping now and then to ask some question.
In half an hour Mr. Salamons came back, bringing
with him two grave-looking men in plain clothes, whom
he conducted into the little parlour. About ten minutes
afterwards Gilbert Arnold let himself in at the door
with a latch-key, and walked straight up to the room in
which the Major and Mrs. Walsingham were waiting
for him. Claribel, at the request of Major Varney,
had allowed her thick mourning veil to cover her face,
which it completely concealed. At the sight of the
Major, Gilbert Arnold recoiled in amazement.
“Ah! my worthy friend," said the Indian officer, “I

133
dare say you are surprised at seeing me. But pray re-
serve yourself, for you'll be a good deal more surprised
presently. My dear madam, be good enough to raise
your veil, while I snuff this abominable tallow candle.
And now, Joseph Slogood, alias Gilbert Arnold, alias
never-mind-what, tell me if you know this lady."
“My name's not Gilbert Arnold, and I don't know
any of you!” answered the poacher.
"Ah, yes, you do; you know us all very well indeed.
And to begin with, you know your son, or the poor boy
you've had the audacity to call your son for a period
of fourteen years. You know him very well, Gilbert
Arnold. You know this injured boy. Look at him,
fall at his feet, and grovel in the dust before him, and
ask him if he can ever bring himself to forgive you;
but don't tell us you don't know him. You know SIR
RUPERT LISLE !”
The poacher dropped into a chair that stood near
him, and resting his elbows upon his knees, buried his
face in his hands.
“Ah, there's a little shame left in you, is there!”
said the Major scornfully. “You've been able to keep
your wicked secret for fourteen years; but the daylight
has been let in upon it at last. Your conspiracy is
discovered ; and if you hope for mercy from this in-
jured lady, or her son, who in a month from this day
will be of age, you had better speak quickly, and speak
the truth. What is the meaning of this abominable
plot ?-at whose instigation was it carried out ? Are
you the sole mover of it, or is there anybody else in it ?
Speak!”
"I shan't !” roared the poacher, springing to his
feet, and grasping the chair in his strong hand, as if
he would have hurled it at the Major. "I shan't! I'm
not dirt, to be trampled under your feet. I'm not your
slave, to do your bidding, and to learn my lessons like
a baby, and to follow and fawn like a dog! Suppose I
say I shan't speak—suppose I say I won't go through
with it-suppose I say I'd sooner be hung There ?”

Lady Lisle.
He struck the chair violently upon the floor, and then
falling into it once more, began to cry like a child.
“The man is mad, or he has been drinking," said
Major Varney to Claribel ; and then going close up to
Gilbert Arnold, he bent his lips dowa to the ear of the
poacher, and whispered,
“Bully! coward! Either speak or be hung, then !
Take your choice now, and take it quickly; for there
are two detectives waiting downstairs, and I've only to
go to them and inform against you."
Gilbert Arnold, still whimpering piteously, looked up
and rubbed his eyes with his dirty hands.
“I've been drinking a bit,” he said, apologetically,
“and you're too hard upon a man, and I can't bear it.
I am not dirt,” he added, "and though I may get used
to being trampled upon, sometimes it goes again me,
and it puts my blood up, and I can't bear it. If I must
speak, why speak I must. Now then, what have you
got to ask me, and what do you want to know ?” Mr.
Arnold put his legs astride across the chair, folded his
arnis upon the top rail, and, resting his chin upon his
coat-sleeves, looked the Major full in the face.
“Are you only concerned in this plot, or is there any.
body else in it is
“No, there's nobody else," answered the poacher.
He spoke with a dogged air, as if he had been saying
a lesson that he hated.
“ Have you been alone in it from first to last ?”
6. Yes, from fust to last."
“Captain Walsingham was entirely ignorant of it ?"
“ He was.”
“ And what was the motive of it?"
“ To put my boy into Sir Rupert's place."
“ And what has become of your boy?”
Gilbert Arnold paused for a few moments before he
answered this last question, and then, looking down,
said sulkily,
“ Dead."
“Dead! ha, ha, I see! The hand of Nemesis in

visible here, my dear madam—the hand of Nemesis.
And so the plot has failed owing to the death of your
own son?”
“ Owin' to that-yes."
“What first suggested such an idea to you p
" Eh ?"
“What was it that first put it into your head to change
your son for Rupert Lisle?”.
“People was always a-talkin' of the likeness between
the boys, and of mine bein' every bit as good a lookin'
lad as the other, and it seemed hard, somehow, that
one should live on the fat of the land and the other
have none of the sweets of this life. So I thought, if
I ever got the chance, I'd just put my boy in the other
one's shoes, and see if he didn't make as good a baronet
as Sir Rupert.”
“And you did get the chance?”.
“Yes, that day as Sir Rupert's pony ran away with
him and threw him upon Lislewood downs. I was
passin' in a shay cart, drivin' home from the market
town by the hills instead of by the road, and I found
the boy lyin' on the ground insensible, down by
Durden's Hollow. I picked him up, took him home,
and kep' him hid for a day or two, bein' all that time
queer in his head and knowin' nothing nor no one; and
then I contrived to take him up to London by the train
one night. I put him into a hospital there, and he
picked up and got round in a few months, and then I
moved up to London myself, taking my wife and child
with me."
" And what did you mean to do with the two boys?"
asked the Major.
"Why, I meant to let the time slip by till they grew
older and bigger; and when there was a chance of my
lady there having forgotten the looks of hers, I meant
to have gone to her and told her as how I'd found him
a poor lad in London streets, and how I thought he
was stole by gipsies, and my boy would have been
taught his lesson, and would have bore me out in what

I said, and then my boy would have passed as Sir
Rupert Lisle, and been master of a fine house and a
fine fortune.”
“But your boy died ?”.
“Yes, a twelvemonth after Sir Rupert's accident he
took ill of a fever and died. There, will that do ?”
“Yes, that will do, Mr. Gilbert Arnold. A very
nice confession, which I hope you will be prepared to
repeat to the solicitors of Sir Rupert Lisle, and of the
gentleman now known as Sir Launcelot Lisle. I think,
in the meantime, my worthy Arnold, you will have to
consider yourself in custody, till your confession has
been duly taken down, and certified by proper wit-
nesses. As to Mrs. Walsingham and Sir Rupert Lisle,
I have no doubt that by throwing yourself upon their
generosity, you will be rewarded for your amiable
candour, instead of being punished for your villany.-
Now, Mrs. Walsingham, Salamons shall go to the
Bricklayers' Arms and fetch the carriage, and then I
think we may safely bid Mr. Gilbert Arnold good night,
and take Sir Rupert Lisle away with us.”
CHAPTER XVI.
THE RESTORED MASTER OF LISLEWOOD.
The conspiracy of which the candid Mr. Gilbert Arnold
had made confession was never investigated in a court
of law. Sir Launcelot Lisle, or the gentleman who had
for fourteen years enjoyed the possession of the Lisle
title and estates, was an octogenarian and a bachelor,
and he did not make any attempt to dispute the claims
of the pale-faced fair-haired stripling who had arisen,
as if from the dead, to demand the heritage of his father.
Sir Launcelot's lawyers shook their heads at Mr. Gilbert
Arnold's confession, until they found that confession
borne out by the testimony of the young man's mother,
whose instinct could scarcely be supposed to deceive

137
her, and whose motives were above suspicion, and fur-
ther, by the testimony of facts which still helped con-
siderably to bear out the assertions of the lodge-keeper
of Lislewood Park. The medical officers of St. George's
Hospital remembered, fourteen years before, having
attended in the casualty ward a little boy of about seven
years of age, whose life was in danger for three long
months, from concussion of the brain, caused, as the
man who brought him to the hospital stated, by a fall
from a pony. There was no one belonging to the insti-
tution who could remember or describe the appearance
of the person who brought the child to the hospital, but
one of the nurses, when confronted with Gilbert Arnold,
immediately recognized him as the man who had taken
the little boy away with him after his recovery. She
remembered his face, she said, and she remembered,
too, his gruff voice and savage manner, and she had
called him a brute for speaking roughly to the child.
This nurse told also how the little boy had been in the
habit, in his delirium, of talking of his beautiful mamma
and the Park,—she could not remember the name by
which he called the Park, but it was Something Park;
and he had called himself Sir Something, and said that
he was a baronet—the Little Baronet his papa called
him. But she said that, as all sick people are apt to
have queer fancies, and as the man who brought the boy
had told the nurses not to notice what he said, as he had
always been rather flighty, she had thought very little
of all his wild feverish talk. Claribel cried bitterly as
the woman told these things to the committee of inquiry
assembled in the lawyer's office. She thought of those
long days and nights of cruel anguish, in which she had
mourned her son as dead. And through all this time
of agony, the child, who should have been tended by a
mother's loving hands, had been lying in a narrow bed
in a public hospital, waited on only by hired nurses,
who were deaf to his complaints, and incredulous of his
assertions.
In further evidence of the truth of his confession,

Gilbert Arnold produced the clothes worn by Sir Rupert
upon the day of his accident. The mother recognized
the little clay-stained tunic, the bent and torn hat with
its broken feather. Even the long flaxen curls had been
cut off by the ruthless hands of the lodge-keeper, and
had been kept for fourteen years folded between two
stiff sheets of white paper. The evidence submitted to
Launcelot Lisle fully satisfied him as to the identity of
his young kinsman. For himself, he said, he was an
old man, without a child to whom he could leave the
broad lands of Lislewood, and he was willing enough
that their revenues should pass once more into the
hands of the elder branch. Had the boy been found a
few years later, he added, the name of Lisle might have
been extinct. He offered further to restore the interest
of the property which, for fourteen years, had been paid
to his bankers ; hut Sir Rupert wrote his generous
cousin a very pretty letter, by dictation of Major Varney,
in which he stoutly refused his consent to any suck
restoration.
So the way was smoothed for the return of the
banished prince, who had so long been unjustly deprived
of his rights; and the simple villa oors of Lislewood re-
joiced in the restoration of their 1.,;htſul lord, and the
tender-hearted mother wept for very joy as she drove
into Lislewood Park, with her son seated by her side;
and the bells were rung, and the charity children turned
out once more, as they had done years ago in honour of
Claribel Merton's first wedding-day; and through all
the merry noise, and under the blazing July sun, rode
General Monk, upon a stately white charger, on the right
hand of the prince whose restoration he had achieved.
Of course, General Monk was no other than Major
Varney, stout and débonnaire, yellow-whiskered and
yellow-moustached, handsome and portly, affable and
delighted. He leaped from his horse when the cortègo
arrived at the mansion, and there was question of hand-
ing sir Rupert out of the carriage. The servants were
rraged in the hall waiting to welcome their master.

The Restored Master of Lislewood. 139
How they all exclaimed when they saw the pale-faced
young gentleman, whom his mamma and Major Varney
led into the house! How little Sir Rupert had changed
they said. He had only grown taller, and perhaps, if
anything, handsomer. The young Baronet was a little
embarrassed by their honest greetings, and seemed to
look to his champion, the Major, for assistance in the
ordeal.
A close observer would not have been long in the
society of the young man without discovering that he
appeared to appeal to Major Varney on every occasion,
however trifling. He was leaning on Major Varney's
arm when he pointed out to his mother the pictures in
the corridors, the portrait of his father in the dining-
room, the oriel window in the library, in which he had
been so fond of sitting when a little boy. It was only
natural that, after fourteen years spent in the society of
Gilbert Arnold, Sir Rupert Lisle should be a little awk-
ward at the dinner-table; that he should use a knife for
his fish; that he should be not a little confused by the
man who brought him melted butter, and the other man
who brought him fish-sauce; that he should wonder at
the flat champagne glasses; that he should want to
drink more sparkling Moselle than was good for him;
and that he should wind up by quenching his thirst
from his finger-glass. This, though very painful to his
mother, was only natural; and it was only natural,
therefore, that Major Varney should whisper a hint
every now and then, or tread upon his toe, or nudge him
slightly with the elbow, or frown an intimation of this
or that solecism.
The Major and his wife had been invited by Sir
Rupert and Mrs. Walsingham to spend the autumn at
Lislewood Park, and to assist at the celebration of the
Baronet's majority, which was to take place a few days
after his return. "Claribel had hoped after dinner to
have had the boy all to herself in the long drawing-room;
to have had him seated by her side upon the sofa, and
to have talked with him of his unforgotten childhood.

Lady Lisle.
She stopped beside his chair, and whispered to him as
she left the dining-room with Mrs. Varney. She begged
him not to linger long over his wine, but to join her
soon in the drawing-room; but, in spite of her request,
it was dark before the Major and he left the dining-
room, and she saw, to her horror, that the young man
had been drinking too much. She remonstrated with
Major Varney, but he shook his head, with a smile, and
said, -
“My dearest Mrs. Walsingham, our prince is a little
obstinate ; only enough so, you know, to bespeak a
very creditable firmness of will, but still just a little
obstinate. He likes port, and objects to claret. Poor
dear child! It is so like the pupil of that horrible
poacher man to prefer port. I daresay he would like
it thick and sweet. Injured child! It will take us
some time to form him, my dear madam.”
Claribel sighed. “He is very much changed," she
said, thoughtfully. “Heaven forgive me, I sometimes
feel as if I were not sufficiently grateful for his blessed
restoration to me. I sometimes feel as if there were
something wanting still to make me happy in the return
of my son.”
“My dear Mrs. Walsingham,” said the Major ear-
nestly, “you must not ask too much of this poor boy ;
you must give him time; and, above all, you must
allow for the evil influence produced by the associations
of fourteen years."
The morning after the arrival of Sir Rupert, his half-
brother came from Eton, to pay his obeisance to the
Lord of Lislewood. There was something strange in
the contrast between the two brothers—young Arthur
Walsingham, tall and broad-shouldered, dark-com-
plexioned and stalwart, nearly as big at fourteen years
of age as his half-brother, the Baronet, at one-and-
twenty. Major Varney was with Sir Rupert when
young Walsingham arrived. Perhaps it was the Major
who had dictated or suggested the loving speech with
which the young man welcomed his brother. Arthur

Walsingham treated the Baronet with very little cere-
mony. The shock of the Captain's death had been a
terrible blow to young Arthur. The sight of the house
in which he and his father had been such constant com-
panions, the downs over which they had so often ridden,
all helped to renew the bitterness of the boy's grief, and
he took very little notice of his new-found brother, the
Baronet.
“To tell you the honest truth, Martin,” he said to
his father's old servant, “I don't much like this new
brother of mine. He's too much under the thumb of
that man with the yellow whiskers, to please me. I
like a fellow to be his own master, and to know his
own mind, and not to have to look at other people
before he opens his mouth.”
It was strange to see the dislike which Arthur Wal-
singham seemed to entertain to Major Varney. Do
what he would, the Indian officer could not make friends
with the boy. He would tell him stories of Indian
life stories which concerned that dead father whom the
lad so tenderly loved; he would dwell upon the friend.
ship which had always existed between himself and the
Captain, as if through that he would have claimed the
boy's affection ; but all his efforts to please were thrown
away. Arthur would listen to this talk with a sulky
unwillingness entirely different from his usual manner.
“I don't like him," he said passionately, when his
mother remonstrated with him one day; "I don't like
him, mother! I don't like his smooth oily manners,
his soft conciliating voice, and glaring yellow hair. No
man with such whiskers and moustaches was ever
anything but a hypocrite. I don't like him! I don't
like the influence he exercises over that namby-pamby
brother of mine "
“ Arthur, Arthur!” Claribel exclaimed reproachfully.
“ Dearest mother, dear patient mother! I would
not say a word against your eldest son; but take my
advice, and get rid of Major Granville Varney."
“Get rid of him! My dear Arthur, do you forget

the part he has taken in the restoration of my son ?
Do you forget that to him we owe the discovery of
that vile plot against my boy? How can we ever
sufficiently prove our gratitude to Major Varney ?”
The boy shrugged his shoulders. “Well, I suppose
you're right, mother,” he said; “but if I were you, I'd
give the Major a few thousands as a repayment for his
services, and kick him out of doors !”
“Arthur! As if he would accept money!"
“Not from you, very likely, mother; and shall I tell
you why not? He knows he will get double and treble
from Sir Rupert Lisle. My brother is little better than
a puppet in his hands. Depend upon it, he will take
care to work the strings well before very long."
To Arthur Walsingham's very great satisfaction,
Major Granville Varney was by-and-by compelled to
leave Lislewood Park for a few days, on very important
business. He had volunteered to negotiate with Mr.
Gilbert Arnold, with a view to giving that person a
sum of money on account of Sır Rupert Lisle, and
shipping him off to America,
“It is hard," said the Major to Mrs. Walsingham
and Sir Rupert, “it is very hard that the man should
be rewarded for his villany; but, had he not confessed,
Sir Rupert might still be mewed up in a back bedroom
in the Old Kent Road. I suppose we must do some-
thing for him.”
Mrs. Walsingham offered no objection whatever to
the man's receiving a few hundred pounds; but Sir
Rupert cavilled and protested against it.
"I hate the fellow,” he said ; “he never used me
properly; he never gave me my liberty, or let me have
money to spend. He mewed me up in a miserable
room, and never had a civil word to say to me. I
won't give him a farthing."
“My dear Sir Rupert," said the Major, “remember,
we bear a great name to-day; we are no longer an
obscure nameless stripling, without a friend in the
world. We must take the advice of those who aro

older and wiser than ourselves. The man must be
paid."
For Major Varney to tell the young Baronet that a
thing must be done, was to insure immediate compli.
ance on the part of Sir Rupert. His mother found it
quite different, when she herself tried to persuade her
eldest son to any step, however trifling. He would
obstinately refuse, telling her that he was of age, and
that he didn't want to be dictated to, or that he was
not going to be tied to a woman's apron-string ; he
had had enough of Mrs. Arnold, with her miserable
pale face and perpetual snivelling. So the Major,
furnished with a cheque for six hundred pounds, left
Lislewood Park on his diplomatic errand. Arrived in
London, he walked straight to the young Baronet's
bankers, where he exchanged the little slip of blue
paper for half a dozen bank notes. On leaving the
bank, he called a cab, and drove to the habitation of
Mr. Joseph Slogood, whom he found sitting at the win-
dow, smoking his accustomed clay pipe. The poacher
looked up, with a scowl, as the Major walked in at the
little garden gate, and, putting down his pipe, opened
the door and admitted his visitor.
“Well," he said, with a sneer, “I am sure I am
proud and honoured that you've come a-nigh me at
last, which I thought you'd done with your used-up
tool.”
“My penetrating Arnold, you were far from wrong
in your conclusion,” said the Major, seating himself on
the sill of the window, and amusing himself by pelting
a smoke-dried geranium in the garden.
“O I warn't wrong, warn't I?” replied Mr. Arnold,
with a savage light in his yellow-green eyes. “You
don't want me no more, I suppose? Eh?”
“No," said the Major, with his most placid air; “no,
I don't want you any more, thank you.”
Mr. Gilbert Arnold clenched his fist, and made as if
he would have struck his elegant visitor. The Major
looked up at him and laughed ; a laugh that brought

the blood into the poacher's face, until his swarthy com
plexion grew almost black. It amused Major Varney
to see the man's suppressed fury, as it would have
amused him to goad the lions at the Zoological Gardens
with the point of his Malacca cane.
“My good Arnold, you are quite right,” he said.
“You have been a very excellent tool; you have served
me very well, and I have done with you. Were mine
an ungenerous mind, our relations would end here.
The little secret which I am so fortunate as to possess
respecting your past life would be a sufficient guarantee
for your keeping any other secret which may in a
remote manner concern me, and here all connection
between us would end. But such is not my intention.
When a good workman has done with his tools, he
generally puts them neatly and conveniently out of his
way. I shall require you, my worthy Arnold, to sail
for America, with your wife, the day after to-morrow.
You will receive the sum of three hundred pounds an
hour before you sail.”
“Three hundred pounds isn't much out of all he'll
have,” said Gilbert sulkily.
. “Out of all who will have ?” asked the Major.
“Why—that is--you know "
“My estimable Arnold, pray keep all silly fancies
out of your head. Remember your confession, signed,
sealed and attested, and now in the safe keeping of
Sir Rupert's solicitors. Pray remember that, and be
thankful for any gift which the generosity of the young
Baronet may obtain for you.”
“I've been a dupe and a tool from first to last, and it
does seem hard,” growled the poacher.
“Hard !” exclaimed Varney; “why, my absurd
Arnold, what, in the name of all that's preposterous,
did you expect?
“Well, then, I'll tell you," answered Gilbert. “I
didn't expect to be foisted off with a paltry three hun-
dred pound. I didn't expect to be sent out of the
country like a felon. I didn't expect to have you

always poking your nose between me and-him as has
come into a fortune. I didn't expect to be forbid
to go straight to him myself and ask him for what I
wanted.”
The Major shrugged his shoulders and laughed
aloud.
“Go to him, then,” he said, pointing to the door;
“go straight to him, now. I won't prevent you. The
road's as clear for you as it is for me. Go to him, and
see what he'll give you! Why, you poor uncalculating
fool, do you know that it was only my persuasion and
my influence that induced him to send you even this
pitiful sum. He has been well taught, my worthy
Arnold, and you'll find the lad knows his lesson."
Two days after that on which this friendly interview
had taken place, Major Varney ran down to Liverpool
by express, having sent on Gilbert Arnold and his wife
by the parliamentary train, which started at some dismal
hour in the early morning. Arrived at Liverpool, the
Major walked straight to a small public-house, at which
he had directed Gilbert to await him. He found the
poacher drinking beer in a dismal little sitting-room
looking out upon a dead wall.
“Now, then," said the Indian officer, “ the vessel
sails in half an hour, and I mean to see you on board.
Ring that bell, and ask for pen and ink."
Mr. Arnold obeyed, and a waiter brought a sheet of
paper, and a battered inkstand which contained a black
mixture chiefly composed of dust and flies, but the
nearest approach to ink attainable in the establishment.
The Major dipped a pen in the mixture and handed it
to Gilbert.
“ Write me a receipt for six hundred pounds," he
said. “'Received from Major Varney, on the part
of Sir Rupert Lisle, Bart., the sum of six hundred
pounds in full satisfaction of all claims.' Write
that.”
Gilbert's face brightened considerably at the Major's
words.

Lady Lisle.
“You've thought better of it, then," he said ; "you're
a-going to make it six hundred ? And that ain't
half what's doo to me neither,” added Mr. Arnold
sulkily.
“Never mind whether I've thought better of it, or
whether I haven't. Write the receipt. We've no time
to lose."
Gilbert squared his elbows, brought his nose down to
within a couple of inches of the paper, and wrote with
some difficulty as the Major dictated. Major Varney
then rang a second time for the waiter, and, in his
presence, Gilbert Arnold signed his name at the bottom
of the document, the waiter afterwards affixing his
signature as witness.
“Now call a cab,” said the Major to the waiter;
“ and you, Arnold, tell your wife we're waiting for
her."
"She's gone to lie down,” said Gilbert; "she's
tired with the journey. She’s but a poor thing for
a man to have tied to him,” he added, as he left the
room.
Half an hour afterwards the Major stood with Arnold
and his wife on the deck of the vessel that was to con
vey the two latter to New York.
“You haven't given me that there six hundred," said
Gilbert, taking the Major aside.
“ Six hundred, my worthy friend !” exclaimed the
offficer, elevating his eyebrows.
“Yes, six hundred. It was six hundred,” said Gil-
bert. “I gave you the receipt for six hundred, and
you know he gave you the money, and that you've got
it in your pocket. You know you have.”
“My good Arnold, I know nothing but that in ten
minutes more you'll be on your way to America, from
which delightful country I should strongly advise you
never to return. I also know that I have in this pocket-
book a couple of Bank of England notes for a hundred
each, one fifty, two twenties, and a ten. Take them
or leave them. They are the last you'll ever get, my

friend, from the Lislewood property or Major Granville
Varney.”
The Major grrcefully extended the pocket-book to-
wards Mr. Arnold as he said these words. It was the
last moment, and strangers for shore had been ordered
to leave the vessel. The poacher took the pocket-book,
with a curse which, if not loud, was so deep as to sound
like the thunderous growl of some savage beast. The
Major gave a deprecating shrug, lifted his hat in the
most courteous manner to poor Rachel, and walked
quietly towards the ladder, down which the friends of
the passengers were scrambling into the steamer which
was to convey them back to Liverpool.
“And when this here's gone, what am I to do?” roared
Gilbert, clutching hold of the Major's coat-sleeve, as if
he would have detained him by violence.
“What are you to do ?” said Major Varney, turning
round, as he stood on the topmost rung of the ladder,
“rot, starve, steal, die in a workhouse, or live in a gaol!
I've done with you!”.
As the Major uttered these parting words, in his
quietest and most gentlemanly manner, a fury, stronger
than any that had ever possessed him before, filled the
breast of Gilbert Arnold. He sprang towards the side
of the vessel, and, throwing himself half across the
bulwarks, made as if he would have hurled the Major
from the ladder upon which he stood. Some one caught
his clenched fist, and prevented its descending on the
Indian officer.
“I'll tell you what," he roared, with his face over the
side of the vessel, and his grey eyes glaring on his
enemy, "you've sold me, and you've trod upon me, and
you've laughed at me from first to last. You look out;
that's all! If ever I do come back from America, it
shall be the worse for you. If ever I'm hung, I'll be
bung for taking your life. So look out, that's all!"

CHAPTER XVII.
MR. SALAMONS TAKES A JOURNEY.
LATER in the autumn, Mr. Salamons, leaving Lislewood
Park, where he had a pleasant sitting-room upon the
second floor, a quiet cob to ride, a dog-cart with a rakish
mare always at his service, and a pint of the choicest
port in Sussex after dinner every day,-Mr. Salamons,
I say, leaving a place in which he enjoyed these
privileges, started on a little journey, which, as he told
the pretty housemaid who waited upon him, would most
likely occupy the space of a week. He was going to
see a young nephew of his, to whom he was a sort of
guardian, the boy being an orphan, and having a little
bit of property.
“Not much, you know, my dear," Mr. Salamons said,
to the pretty housemaid; “ but just enough to keep him
comfortably, without being a burden to his friends, poor
lad, for he is but delicate.”
So this kind and affectionate uncle, after having been
closeted for a couple of hours with his master, Major
Granville Varney, departed on his amiable errand.
Mr. Salamons' nephew was parlour boarder in a select
gentlemen's school in a small town in Yorkshire. A dull
town, beneath the spires of whose minster the children
played among the graves, and only with their voices
broke the silence of the quiet square in which the holy
edifice stood. A dreary town, which sent two members
to legislate for it at Westminster, and which discussed,
and praised, and scandalized, and belied those members
with untiring energy. Turning out of the high-street of
this dull Yorkshire town, you came upon pretty green
lanes, and beyond the lanes there stretched a wide tract
of pleasant common land, dotted here and there by
clumps of hazel-bushes, among which the children played
in the still summer evenings. In some of these quiet
lanes you came suddenly upon handsome houses, hidden
away, as it were, behind high walls and tall sheltering

149
trees. It was to one of these retired mansions that
Mr. Salamons directed his steps on leaving the railway
station. The house at which he stopped was a square
red-brick building, with stiff rows of high narrow
windows, completely shut in from the lane in which it
stood by a high wall and a pair of stately gates thickly
overgrown with ivy. Mr. Salamons was immediately
admitted on giving his name to the serving-maid who
opened the gates ; but it was to be observed that the
name which Mr. Salamons gave to this Yorkshire serving-
maid was not Salamons, but Saunders. It was to be
observed, too, that Mr. Salamons was dressed entirely in
black, and that he wore a white neckcloth, and had
altogether rather a clerical look. The servant escorted
him into a pretty sitting-room, situated at the back of
the house and opening into a large garden. Mr. Sala-
mons walked straight to the window, which opened
down to the ground, and looked out at the lawn and
flower-beds before him. At some distance, sitting on a
rustic bench, there was a young man, who appeared to
attract the notice of Mr. Salamons.
The young man was reading, and was far too much
absorbed in his book to be aware of Mr. Salamons'
observation of him. He was singularly delicate in
appearance, and the hair which escaped from under his
straw hat was of a pale shade of brown. The principal
of the academy entered the room while Mr. Salamons
was standing at the window. The two men shook hands.
The principal was a fat fair man, whose light hair was
beginning to be variegated by grey streaks. He was a
good man, but just a little pompous.
“I need not ask you how he is,” said Mr. Salamons,
pointing to the window, “ for there he is. He looks
pretty much the same.”
“My dear sir,” said the principal, “ that is precisely
his state. The entire medical profession as represented
in this town,-and we are by no means destitute of
medical talent in this town-may I be forgiven for my
pride as a townsman, if I say we are rich in talent,the

medical profession concur in that. He is pretty much
the same. We trusted to time, but time has done very
little for him; he is pretty much the same. A glass of
Madeira, Mr. Saunders ?”
Mr. Salamons took no notice of the principal's hos-
pitable offer. “How are his spirits ?” he asked, still
speaking of his nephew, the parlour boarder, reading in
the garden.
“Not bad-by no means bad,” replied the principal ;
" in that respect we have nothing to complain of. He
has his books, his botanical studies, his herbal, and his
dog. He is indulged in every innocent fancy, and he
has no fancies that are not innocent. He is a most
amiable youth, and very generally beloved."
“ That is gratifying to the feelings of an uncle," said
Mr. Salamons.
“It is gratifying to the feelings of such an uncle as
yourself, Mr. Saunders," answered the principal.
Mr. Salamons drew a purse out of his pocket, and
counted out forty pounds in bank notes and sterling
coin of the realm, which he handed to the principal.
“ That,” he said, “is our half-yearly payment. Now,
according to my annual custom, I should like to have
five minutes' talk with my poor nephew, and then I'll
walk back to my hotel and dine. To-morrow morning
I return to London.”
.“Yours are flying visits, Mr. Saunders," said the
principal, reflectively. Perhaps he was pondering
whether he could safely invite Mr. Saunders to dinner,
without running any risk of that hospitable invitation
being accepted.
“My duties,” said Mr. Salamons, trying to look at
his white neckcloth, “compel me to return to their
sphere of action; and I am only able to devote a very
brief period to the claims of affection.”
The principal led the way to the garden. The young
man was still reading when they approached; but at
the sound of their footsteps he looked up.
“ Uncle Alfred,” he said, recognizing Mr. Salamons.

“My dear George, I have come to have a look at you.
Yes,” said Mr. Salamons, taking his nephew's thin hand
in his,“ much the same, pretty much the same. Are
you happy, George?”
“Very happy, Uncle Alfred ; everybody is so kind
to me. We are very well treated, and we are very
happy.”
“And you have no wish to leave this place ?"
“None whatever, thank you, Uncle Alfred.”
Mr. Salamons made no reply, but stood for some
minutes looking down at his nephew's face.
“Did ever anybody see such a difference between
him and that young limb yonder !” he thought, as he
watched the placid countenance of his nephew.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE LORD OF LISLEWOOD FALLS IN LOVE.
It was only to be expected that when so great a man,
and, above all, so rich a man, as Sir Rupert Lisle re-
turned to take possession of his paternal acres, humbler
and poorer people should attach some importance to the
event, and cast about in their minds how to turn it to
their own account ; for the study of other people's busi.
ness would be but a poor amusement if it were not for
the chance of making them in some way subservient to
one's own interest. A young man of one-and-twenty,
sufficiently good-looking, enormously rich, and a baronet!
This was the chorus which the young ladies for twenty
miles round Lislewood sang in their hearts, as the fair.
haired master of Lislewood Park rode by upon his chest-
nut mare. Would he marry ? and, if he did, when
would he marry, and whom would he marry ? Such
questions as these were discussed at many tea-tables
during the eventful summer that heralded Sir Rupert's
return. The subject interested all classes alike; pretty
farmers' daughters on the Lisle estate remembered the

story of the Lord of Burleigh, and wondered whether
bir Rupert was a likely man to wed a humble maiden
for love. The handsome barmaid at the Lisle Arms was
pleased to attend the Baronet when he drew rein at the
door of the hostelry to call for sherry and soda water;
for barmaids have been known to make brilliant mar-
riages now and then, and Sir Rupert might be the sort
of man to be won by a wasp-like waist, cherry-coloured
ribbons, and glossy brown ringlets ; the daughters of
country squires smiled upon the Baronet at country
dinner parties, and more than one fair damsel cherished
hopes of reigning in that noble old mansion of which
the young man was master. This state of things lasted
for some months, and during those months Sir Rupert
was as a hero of romance in the eyes of the fair ones
round Lislewood : but at the end of that time an awful
rumour arose, and Sir Rupert fell from his elevation in
one day. The rumour was to the effect that the young
Baronet had actually fallen in love. He had fallen in
love with the youngest daughter of Colonel Marmaduke,
of the Grove, Lislewood.
Colonel Marmaduke was a man of about fifty, very
poor, but very proud. He was a rigid-looking man, with
hair and whiskers all of one cold grey colour-
ma man
who wore his coat always buttoned to the neck-a
terrible man, the tradespeople said ; a man who would
give more trouble about a pound and a half of mutton-
chops than the Lislewood Park housekeeper gave about
all the meat consumed in that great establishment. He
was a severe and awful man, who held court-martials
upon his five daughters' offences, and was reported to
have beaten the eldest with a cane after that young lady
had attained her majority. The Grove was a dreary
place. The house, tall and square, red and uncompro-
mising, was flanked by a dişmal row of poplars, in
form very much resembling the Colonel himself.
The five motherless girls had never known very much
of the joys of this world. They had seen nothing but
poverty from their aradles, and the stern, uncompromis-

ing pride of their father forbade their availing themselves
of any of the few gaieties which Lislewood afforded. He
would not have his daughters appear at a county ball
to which they could not be conveyed in their own car.
riage. Kind dowagers offered to chaperone the young
ladies, but Colonel Marmaduke shivered at the thought of
anything approaching an obligation. “No, they have
nothing but shabby muslin to wear if they went; so let
them stay at home," he would say; "girls are better at
home.” So the girls stayed at home and worked crochet,
and they read all the moveis and travels, biographies and
autobiographies obtainable from the Lislewood book club;
until Laura, the eldest of the five, was on the verge of
thirty, and echoed the complaint of Tennyson's "Mari-
ana,” and declared that the day was dreary, and that
nobody worth speaking of came to Lislewood Grove.
Now, although the four elder sisters bore so striking a
resemblance to each other, both in character and person,
the Colonel's fifth daughter, Olivia, was as unlike the
rest of the family as it was possible for her to be. The elder
girls resembled their dead mother, and were fair-haired
and insipid-looking. Olivia's eyes were of a deep and
sombre black, large and finely shaped, but only lustrous
when she was angry; then they emitted lightning flashes
of beautiful fury, wonderful to look upon, but dangerous
to encounter. She was tall and straight like her father,
and was said to have inherited all his pride. Her will
was more indomitable than that of the Colonel himself,
and while the four fair-haired sisters quailed before him,
shedding tears at the sound of his angry voice, Miss
Olivia would march straight up to him with the terrible
light in her black eyes, and would ask him what he
meant by such conduct, and whether he thought that
the breakfast-parlour was a barrack, or that he was at
the head of his regiment.
“ You might say what you liked to a lot of unhappy
raw recruits, poor wretches ! they were obliged to bear
your insolence; but you shall not conduct yourself in
such a manner to us, while I am in the house 1”

154
Lady Lislo.
And the Colonel would turn very red, pull nervously
at his stock, and walk straight out of the room, grum-
bling to himself, but not uttering one word in reply to
his youngest daughter, for Miss Olivia was her father's
favourite child.
“I never had a son, sir," he would say to his inti-
mate friends. “I never had a son, though I should
have liked to have had one, for Marmaduke is an old
name, and worth preserving; but I have my daughter
Olivia, and she's as good as any son. Egad ! sir, you
should hear her talk to me. She's the only creature I
was ever afraid of, and, upon my word, she sometimes
makes me shake in my shoes.”
Miss Olivia Marmaduke was a very good horse-
woman. Nobody knew how she had acquired that
accomplishment, for there were no horses at the Grove;
but rumour said that in her earlier years she had been
in the habit of catching spirited colts at grass in the
neighbouring meadows, and riding them until they suc-
ceeded in throwing her, which was no easy matter.
Now that she was nineteen years of age, and the pro-
prieties forbade her riding unbroken colts, Miss Olivia
had taken an old riding-habit of her mother's to the
Lislewood tailor, in order that the garment might be
altered to the fashion of the current year; and in this
shabby green-cloth habit, and on a bony grey horse, she
daily rode over the broad downs and through the plea-
sant country roads. In one of these rides the young
Amazon met with the much-talked-of Sir Rupert Lisle.
Her father had called on the young Baronet, and an in.
vitation to a dinner party at the Park had been sent to
the family at the Grove; but in common with all other
invitations, it had been declined by the Colonel, so that
Olivia had never before seen Sir Rupert. She went
home and gave a very animated description of the
encounter.
“He came creeping up the hill, papa," she said,
“ picking his way with that white-footed chestnut of his,
as if he'd been riding over eggs or on a tight-rope, and

when he saw me, he started as if he had seen a ghost,
and my dog, Box, flew at his horse-Box always flies at
horses with white feet-and the Baronet dropped the
bridle and turned as pale as death. “My mare is rather
nervous, miss,' he said ;-I hate men who call you ‘miss ;'
— please call off your dog;' and he looked so frightened
and so stupid that I began to laugh, when he cried out,
'D-n it, will you call off that dog?' Now, it isn't
likely that one of Colonel Marmaduke's daughters was
going to be sworn at, except by the Colonel himself,
So I drew myself up as stiff as a poker, looked the
Baronet straight in the face, called Box in a tone the
young gentleman will not forget in a hurry, and galloped
down the hill. When I got to the bottom I looked back,
and there was Sir Rupert, with his white hat at the back
of his head, staring at me as if he'd been moon-struck.”
"Perhaps he was struck by you, Olivia," simpered
the eldest daughter. “There would be a chance for
you! Sir Rupert Lisle, the best match in the county of
Sussex! Why don't you try and marry him, Olivia ?”.
Miss Marmaduke felt that her own chances of the holy
estate of matrimony grew daily more remote, and she
was rather inclined to be snappish and satirical with her
handsome sister.
“ Try and marry him!” exclaimed that young lady.
“Why, in a week I'd twist him round my fingers, as
Lucy is twisting that stupid crochet cotton. I'd make
him dance any step I pleased, as the showman at Lisle.
wood fair made the puppets he showed to the children.”
And the young lady, who had pretty white hands, imi.
tated the action of pulling the strings of a pasteboard
figure. “Marry him! poor pitiful little milksop! Why,
Laura might marry him, if she had the courage to try,
though her hair is thin at the parting, and she's getting
on for- "
Miss Olivia finished the sentence by coughing mali-
ciously.
“O no, thank you," replied Miss Marmaduke. “I
leave him for you, Olivia. I'm not clever enough, or

handsome enough, and, thank goodness! I haven't
vanity enough to try and entrap"—the young lady laid
a spiteful emphasis on the word "entrap"-"a baronet,
with Heaven knows how many thousands a year, into
marrying me. I leave the task to you, Olivia, and I
shall be very glad to come and see you at Lislewood
Park, if you'll have the goodness to invite me; though,
of course, as I shall be only a poor relation, you'll give
me one of the small bedrooms on the second floor."
The Colonel looked over his newspaper, laughing at
the skirmish between his eldest and youngest born.
“That's right, Livy," he said, “ give it to them, my
girl! You should have married the Prince Regent, if
you'd been born in the last century. There's no man
living could stand against you, if you set your mind
upon having him-is there, Livy ?”
Olivia laid her hands upon the old man's bristling
grey hair, and smoothed it lovingly.
"If I ever do marry a rich man, papa," she said, “it
will be for your sake, and for nobody else." And she
looked at her four sisters, as if she would have added,
“ Not for yours, young ladies, not yours!”
It did not certainly appear as if Sir Rupert Lisle had
any intention to use the Colonel's phrase-of attempt-
ing to stand against the attractions of Miss Olivia
Marmaduke, for the very next morning he called at the
Grove, and apologized for his “ungentlemanly conduct
on the day before.” It was so early when he came, that
breakfast had scarcely been cleared out of the sitting-
room in which the ladies and their papa received him.
“I know I've come too early," he said, “and I've
caught you all in your morning gowns, as he said I
should, and he said I oughtn't to come till one o'clock;
but I couldn't wait any longer, and I should have come
last night, only he wouldn't let me."
During the delivery of this very obscure speech, the
young Baronet grew every moment redder in the face.
Insolent and self-sufficient as he usually was, he seemed
to-day affected by a painful sense of his own insig-
to duke, for tbized for b'so early out of thed him.

nificance. He sat on the extreme edge of his chair, and
shifted his gold-headed riding-whip nervously from
one hand to the other. He was dressed in fashionable
morning costume, wore a great deal more jewellery than
usual, and flourished a cambric handkerchief redolent of
“ Jockey Club” perfume.
Miss Olivia laughed in her admirer's face. “We
don't mind being 'caught in our morning dresses,' Sir
Rupert,” she said; "but it was very considerate of
him to mention it."
The Baronet blushed, if possible, a deeper red than
before. “I meant Major Varney—Major Granville
Varney. Do you know him ? "
“I have not that pleasure,” said Olivia ; " but I have
no doubt he is a very agreeable person.” And the young
lady took a pair of scissors from the table, and walked
straight to the window looking into the garden, where
there was a stand of geraniums. With these flowers the
young lady occupied herself, leaving her papa and sisters
to entertain the visitor.
o Granville Varney," said the Colonel. “Ah! I saw
him when I called at the Park, Sir Rupert. I think he
told me that he was in the Company's service.”
The Baronet, whose eyes were fixed upon the hand-
some face bending over the flowers, seemed not to hear
a word of Colonel Marmaduke's remark.
“Do you think she's very much offended with me?"
he asked.
“ Shem ?” said the Colonel, interrogatively.
“Miss, I mean. I knew I was rude yesterday; but
that chestnut mare's so confoundedly nervous, hang
her; she'd throw me for half a farthing; and I told the
Major all about it, and he said my conduct was shock-
ing, and I've come on purpose to apologize ; so I do
hope Miss will think no more about it. I shall never
forget the look she gave me to my dying day ; it went
through me like a bullet. Will you forgive me, miss ?”
he added, imploringly, appealing to Olivia.
• 0, of course,” she said, "There is very little for

me to forgive. I dare say it comes quite natural to you
to swear; but, you see, I'm not used to it. When papa
swears, I order him out of the room."
" She does, Sir Rupert!” exclaimed the Colonel.
" Egad, sir ! this girl of mine orders me out of the
room.”
“I think she might order anybody to do anything,
Colonel Marmaduke," said the young man, still fidget-
ing with his hat and cane ; "for I'm sure nobody would
ever refuse to obey her.”
Olivia snipped the faded leaves off her geraniums, and
looked out into the garden where her dog was basking
in the sunshine, and behaved herself altogether as if
there had been no such thing as Sir Rupert Lisle in the
scheme of the universe. The young man sat for some
time silently staring at her, and scarcely able to reply
to a few polite remarks made by the Colonel. At last,
after he had completely exhausted the patience of his
host, it dawned upon the love-stricken Baronet that it
was time for him to go. He shook hands with the
Colonel and with the four eldest girls, and then walked
to the window, by which Miss Olivia stood. He held
out his hand, and she laid the tips of her fingers in it.
He pressed them for a moment, and then let them drop,
as if they had burned him.
“Do you forgive me, Miss Olivia ?” he asked.
He had learnt her name from hearing her sisters ad.
dress her.
“O dear me, yes! Didn't I say so just now?" she
said impatiently.
These two or three syllables seemed quite to anni-
hilate the master of Lislewood. He shambled out of the
room, knocking over a light cane chair in his exit; and
a few minutes afterwards the Marmaduke family heard
the clatter of his horse's hoofs upon the high road
before the house.
“Why, Livy,” said the Colonel,“ how rude you were
co Sir Rupert! The young man seems very anxious .
to be civil to us. He is dreadfully uncultivated, cer-

tainly; but that is not to be wondered at under the
circumstances.”
Olivia Marmaduke took no notice whatever of this
observation of her father's.
" What rooms will you have when you come to live
with me at Lislewood Park, papa ? ” she said. “I re-
member, when we went over the house years ago, I
noticed a very pretty suite of oak-panelled rooms on
the south side. The housekeeper showed us the rooms
occupied by Sir Rupert's father. There is a secret stair.
case opening out of the bedroom, with a sliding panel,
and communicating with a subterranean passage leading
into the park. It's such a dear romantic old house."
“And you are to be mistress of it, Olivia, it appears,"
said her eldest sister, with a sneer.
“I think so, Laura, dear, if I can bring my mind to
the sacrifice,” answered the young lady. “Never mind;
I will get you a rich husband when I am Lady Lisle."
CHAPTER XIX.
ACCEPTED.
SIR RUPERT LISLE followed up his first visit to the
Grove by presents of game, hothouse fruit, and hothouse
flowers, the latter especially directed to Miss Olivia Mar-
maduke, and accompanied by a note, far more elegant
than could well have been expected from the young
Baronet. The handwriting was stiff and laboured, cer-
tainly, but Sir Rupert expressed himself much better on
paper than he had done by word of mouth.
“I suppose this was dictated by the gentleman who
told him not to come early enough to catch us in our
morning gowns," said Olivia, as she examined the
armorial bearings embossed upon the glistening paper.
“Look at the bloody hand, Laura," she said, " and
the motto in old French, which, being translated, means,

· Lisle guards what Lisle wins.' Who would ever think
that flaxen-haired stripling came of such a noble house ?
That sickly effeminate face and low forehead of his have
such a plebeian look. I fancy a Lisle, of Lislewood,
ought to be tall and stalwart, dark and stern. You're
a thousand times more like a baronet, papa, than Sir
Rupert is."
The Marmadukes are as old a family as the Lisles,
Livy," said her father; “Randal Marmaduke refused
a peerage in the reign of Charles I.”
" Then he was very stupid, papa. I should have liked
you to have been an earl. Lady Olivia sounds remark-
ably well."
Three days after this, the Baronet drove out to the
Grove with his mother and Major Varney, in a barouche.
The young man had given Claribel no rest until she had
promised to call upon Colonel Marmaduke's daughters,
and invite them to the Park.
“I assure you, my dear Rupert, that they visit no
one,” Mrs. Walsingham said.
“But they'll visit me; they must and shall visit me,"
exclaimed the young man. “I'm the richest man in
Sussex, and it's very hard if I can't have what visitors
I please. They shall come.”
"Rupert, don't be foolish," Claribel remonstrated.
“Foolish! I'm not foolish. But I want to have those
Grove people to dinner; I've taken a fancy to the
Colonel."
“0, to the Colonel,” said Major Varney, laughing.
“Not to either of his daughters ? "
“No, not to either of his daughters," Sir Rupert
declared, blushing very violently. “I suppose I may
take a fancy to an old military man, without anybody
interfering, and prying, and poking their noses into my
business. I like the Colonel, and I'll have him at my
house, and I'll have his daughters at my house. They
shall live here, if I please.”
“If they please, I should think," said the Major
quietly.

" I suppose I may choose my own words,” the young
man muttered.
“ I suppose you may, Sir Rupert,” answered Major
Varney; "but it would be perhaps as well to remember,
that gentlemen are not in the habit of raising their
voices in their own drawing-rooms when addressing
their guests.”
“Guest!” repeated Sir Rupert, with a sneer. "You've
been here rather a long time for a guest. I should think
you lived here."
“Rupert !” exclaimed his mother, “can you forget?”
“O, I don't forget anything," said the Baronet;
“ people take precious care that I don't forget any-
thing. My banker could tell how often I get reminded
of things; but as to that,” he added, turning to the
Major, "you're free to stay here as long as you like, and
to eat and drink what you like, and to get all out of me
that you can, but I won't be interfered with when I set my
mind upon a thing. Do you hear that? I won't be inter.
fered with.” The Baronet walked out of the room, slam-
ming the door after him. It was the first time he had ever
resisted Major Varney's authority by so much as a word.
One glance round the little sitting-room at the Grove
told the Major which of the young ladies had attracted
Sir Rupert Lisle. The four elder sisters were all at
work at their everlasting crochet when the visitors
entered, but Olivia was seated by the fire, listlessly
turning over the leaves of a book. Major Varney con-
trived to seat himself near her, and to engage her in
conversation. The Baronet, seated behind his mother,
looked terribly vexed by this arrangement. But polished
as the Major was, he did not get on very well with Miss
Olivia Marmaduke. The young lady made such brief
replies to his elegant sentences, and looked him so hard
in the face with her penetrating black eyes when he
spoke to her, that he walked away from her at last with
a shudder.
“What a terrible girl that youngest daughter is !

he muttered to Sir Rupert. “She looks like Semiramis
in & shabby silk."
“I don't know Semiramis," the Baronet answered
impatiently, “and I dare say Miss Olivia will have plenty
of handsome silks some of these days."
“Why, my poor foolish Rupert, surely it isn't Miss
Olivia with whom you're smitten? Surely not that
yellow-complexioned girl, with those horrible bold black
eyes. Now I really do think the elder Miss Marmaduke
rather pretty. She is fair, and is certainly elegant-
looking.”
“That eldest girl's a guy," answered Rupert; "and
Miss Olivia's the handsomest woman I ever saw."
Although Olivia Marmaduke chose to repel the
Major's attentions, and to do all in her power to make
herself disagreeable to that gentleman, the Colonel, her
father, liked the Indian officer very well. The two men
talked of military matters, the state of the Punjaub,
and the adaptability of native troops; and before Major
Varney left, Olivia's father had invited him to dine at
the Grove on the following day. The Baronet heard
the invitation, and cried out, “O then, I shall come too,
Colonel. You haven't asked me, but I suppose where
Major Varney's welcome I am. You needn't put your-
self out of the way because I'm coming,” he added,
condescendingly; “ treat me just like one of yourselves.
No finery and no ceremony."
The Colonel reddened. “ As an old soldier should
always live like a gentleman, he ought always to be
prepared to receive a gentleman,” he said gravely.
Miss Olivia interrupted him. “Yes, papa; but per-
haps, as Rupert Lisle is coming, we had better send to
the Ship at Brighton for a couple of French cooks, and
a staff of waiters. Mary will never be equal to attend-
ing on him.”
The Baronet felt that she was laughing at him.
“Perbaps you'd rather I didn't come,” he said sheep-
ishly.
“0, but think of the honour we shall lose if you

stayed away. All Lislewood will be talking of the
Prince of Sussex and his Royal Highness's gracious
visit.”
“Well, what do you think now of that pert, ill-bred
girl ?” asked Major Varney of the Baronet, as they
drove homewards.
"I don't think her ill-bred at all," muttered Sir
Rupert.
"Don't you? Egad! there's only one excuse for her
conduct, and that is, her thinking you so," said his
friend.
At about six o'clock the next day, the Major and
Sir Rupert were ushered into the drawing-room at the
Grove. It was a dreary-looking, ill-furnished room, with
three windows looking out into the high road. Every
article of furniture had seen better days. The brussels
carpet was faded and threadbare. The veneer upon the
tables was chipped and scratched; the gilding of the
old-fashioned oval looking-glasses was tarnished; the
chintz that covered the sofas was worn and washed out.
In the midst of this dreary apartment, Olivia Marmaduke
looked more dazzling than she could have done in the
most brilliant ball-room. She wore a simple dress of
white muslin, ornamented with a few careless bows
of pink ribbon. She seemed better disposed towards
Major Varney than she had done on the day before ;
and she talked to him all dinner-time, to the discom-
fiture of the Baronet.
Poor as the Colonel was, he knew how to receive a
guest in decent style, and the dinner was unexception-
able in its way, entirely without pretence, well cooked
and neatly served. Sir Rupert wondered that a man
who wore a shabby coat, and lived in a shabbily fur-
nished house, could give decent wine to his friends,
and receive a county magnate with the cordial ease of
manner which he might have displayed towards a half-
pay lieutenant.
When the gentlemen re-entered the drawing-room,
Olivia was still pleased to be gracious to the Major.

Lady Lislo.
She played a game of chess with him, much to the
annoyance of Sir Rupert, who could only stand at her
elbow and look on. To the surprise of the Major, he
was beaten by his fair opponent. She rattled through
some brilliant polkas and waltzes at a little shabby
cottage piano, and sang a couple of showy Swiss songs.
Sir Rupert listened to the notes as if they had been the
hymns of Paradise; but when the other ladies sat down
to play long fantasias and to sing Italian scenas, the
Baronet turned his back on the piano, that he might
talk to his enchantress. This evening it seemed as if
the capricious young lady had determined on fascinating
the Major as well as his young companion. She talked
to him, she laughed at his jokes, and quizzed Sir Rupert
Lisle for his edification; she sang and played to him,
until the Indian officer must indeed have been a strong
man to withstand the power of the enchantress. As for
Sir Rupert, be only appeared more fascinated when
Olivia laughed at him. He followed her about the room,
he hung over the piano when she played and sang; but
tried in vain to get a few minutes' quiet conversation
with her. Somehow or other, the Major always occupied
the young lady's attention at the very moment that the
Baronet had made up his mind to say something tender
and complimentary. Towards the close of the evening,
Sir Rupert appeared to abandon the hope of approach-
ing his charmer, except in the company of his friend,
and he resigned himself sulkily to his fate. He was
sulky all the way home; but as he and the Major were
taking off their overcoats in the hall, he said abruptly,
“Well, how do you like her now?”
“No more than I liked her yesterday. She is bril-
liant, certainly, and she looks handsome by candlelight;
but she's a consummate coquette, artful and ambitious,
heartless and designing. Heaven help the man who
marries her! No, I don't like her.”
" Then you're an infernal hypocrite!” cried Sir Ru-
pert savagely; “for I'll be hanged if you haven't been
making love to her all the evening."

“ I always make love to coquettes, my Rupert,” Major
Varney answered quietly.
Sir Rupert Lisle was more fortunate the next day;
for in the course of his morning's ride over the downs
he overtook Miss Olivia Marmaduke, attended by her
dog Box. She wished him good morning, and he rode
by her side for some distance without saying a word
beyond the first salutation.
“Well,” said the young lady at last, when they had
ridden side by side for about ten minutes, “ as you don't
seem to have very much to say to me, I see no reason
whatever for my retaining you here, especially," she
added, maliciously—“ especially as your mare, no doubt,
is dying for a scamper over the hills.”
“I don't care for the hills; I don't care for anything
at least,” he stammered, “ that is, only for one thing,
only for one person in the whole wide world. I'm the
richest man in the county, but I'm very unhappy, and
nobody can make me happy but- " He came to a
dead stop, and his fair sickly face grew crimson.
“But what, pray ?” asked Olivia.
“But you. You will marry me, won't you? You'll
be the richest woman in the county of Sussex, if you
are my wife; think of that! You shall have any pin-
money you like to name, or that your father likes to
name and I know he's an old screw-1-1-mean, of
course, he's a man of business. You'll be Lady Lisle.
You'll be mistress of the finest estate and one of the
finest houses in Sussex. Will you say yes ?”
For one moment Olivia Marmaduke's face grew more
thoughtful than Sir Rupert had ever seen it look before.
“ You're not very sentimental, Sir Rupert,” she said.
“ You don't ask me whether I can give you love, or
respect, or constancy; you only ask me to be your wife.
Well, on consideration, I think I may say— ".
“Yes, yes, yes! You will say yes !” exclaimed the
young man, seizing her disengaged hand suddenly, mucb
to the alarm of the chestnut mare.
“Very well, then, -yes."

CHAPTER XX.
THE MAJOR FINDS HIS PUPIL MUCH TOO CLEVER.
Sir RUPERT LISLE went home in such high spirits, that
the children in the road stopped to stare at the young
Baronet as he galloped furiously past them. He was
generally a timid horseman, seldom riding at more than
a walking pace, and the man at the lodge wondered
what had happened, as Sir Rupert dashed through the
gates and flew along the avenue. When he sprang off
his mare at the portico of the house, his face was bathed
in perspiration. He took off his white hat, and fanned
himself with it, as he ran up the steps. There were some
light basket-work lounging chairs among the hothouse
flower in the portico. In one of these Major Varney
was seated, and on another his varnished boots were
gracefully extended in an attitude of luxurious repose.
He took his amber-stemmed meerschaum pipe from his
mouth as the young Baronet rushed into the portico.
“Is Chichester Cathedral on fire, my Rupert,” he
said; “and have you come here for the Lislewood Park
engine? It is kept in the garden-house, I think, and
Jacobs the gardener has the keys. You had better ga
to him."
The Major laughed his own melodious laugh at his
little joke, and contemplated the excited Baronet with a
lazy smile.
“Keep your wit for those that can appreciate it,” re-
torted the young man sulkily. “ Chichester Cathedral
might burn to the ground, and you with it, for aught I
care.”
“My grateful Rupert, that is so like you," murmured
the Major.
“And all the town of Chichester into the bargain,"
pursued the young man. “What do I care for any-
body, or anything? I'm the happiest man in Sussex
and the richest man in Tussex, and I shall have the
handsomest wife in Sussex.”

The Major finds his Pupil Too Clever. 167
“The-handsomest—wife!” The Major paused be-
tween each of these words, opening his eyes wider
with every syllable, till at last he sat mutely regarding
the Baronet, as if utterly unable to recover from the
surprise he had experienced. Sir Rupert felt very un-
comfortable under the steadfast stare of Major Varney's
light-blue eyes.
“Don't sit there gaping at me like that,” he said
savagely ; “ I'm not an exhibition, or a Siamese twin, or
à pig-faced lady. You haven't paid a shilling for the
sight of me, have you? Upon my word,” he continued
passionately, “I don't like the way I'm treated, and I
won't stand it, either, much longer. Because my edu-
cation hasn't been as good as it ought to be for a man
of my station and my position in life, I suppose I'm to
be bullied and ordered about, and tyrannized over, and
stared at by any beggarly officer who chooses to take up
his quarters in my house. Once for all, I won't stand it.
Do you hear? I won't stand it!”
The Baronet's treble voice rose to a scream of rage
and fury as he uttered the last words. Major Varney
took two or three puffs from his meerschaum before he
made any sign of having even heard this angry outburst.
Presently he said, quietly,—“Sir Rupert Lisle, this is
the second occasion on which you have insulted me in
this house. Now, as you happen to be the very last per-
son from whom I would consent to excuse an insult, I
shall take a very early opportunity of remonstrating
with you, in a manner that I think cannot fail to be
effectual. In the meantime I must beg you to be so
good as to return to the subject on which you were
speaking just now. You said something about a wife,
the handsomest wife in Sussex. Pray what did you
mean?"
“Why, this is what I meant,” cried the Baronet. “I
meant that I've made an offer of marriage to Miss
Olivia Marmaduke, and that she has accepted it, and
that in less than a month she will be Lady Lisle. Do
you understand that ? She'll be my wife, Lady Lisle."

Lady Lislo.
“You've been rather in a hurry, my Rupert,” replied
Major Varney, with an amiable smile, “and, on the
whole, it would have been better for yourself, and would
have saved the young lady a good deal of unnecessary
trouble, had you first consulted your friends. But no
matter: boys will be boys. You have been a little im.
petuous, and we must talk this matter over quietly in
the evening.”
Sir Rupert Lisle did not stay to hear anything more,
but strode out of the portico, banging the glass door
behind him. A little Blenheim spaniel ran against him
as he crossed the hall, and the young man kicked the
animal savagely away. Claribel heard the dog whine,
and looked out at the drawing-room door to see what
was amiss.
“You'll have to clear away your dogs out of this
place in a month, mother,” said Sir Rupert. "I'm
going to bring a new mistress home to the Park.”
“What do you mean, Rupert ? " asked his mother.
“I mean that I'm going to be married before a
month's over my head. Egad! you all seem so sur-
prised, that one would think I'd no right to choose a
wife for myself.”
“You might have been a little less impetuous, Rupert,
certainly,” replied Claribel.
“Ah, yes, of course. That is to say, I might have
asked your consent, and Major Varney's consent, and
Master Walsingham, your favourite son's consent. I'll
tell you what it is, you're all of you in a plot to keep
the upper hand of me, but I'm a little bit too clever for
you, and I mean to be my own master.”
Mrs. Walsingham turned her back upon the Baronet,
and re-entered the drawing-room, without making any
reply. For some time there had been a coolness be-
tween herself and her eldest son, which had every day
increased. Deeply as she had mourned for his loss, his
restoration had been, perhaps, a still deeper grief to her;
for a cruel and bitter truth had been revealed to her
since the heir of Lislewood had regained his rights.

The Major finds his Pupil Too Clever. 169
Day by day and hour by hour the hard reality had
made itself apparent, and the mother's fond dream had
melted away. Her son was indeed restored to her, but
his restoration brought her sorrow instead of joy, for
he was no longer worthy of her love. A feeling almost
akin to aversion arose in the mother's breast, as the
meanness of her new-found son's character betrayed
itself in his every word and action. She had expected
to find him so noble, so tender, so affectionate; and it
stung her to the heart to find him base and sordid, cold
and pitiless.
She did all in her power to conceal her real feelings,
to hide her disappointment; but in spite of her efforts,
Sir Rupert saw that she was disappointed in him,
and perceived also that Arthur Walsingham was her
favourite son.
After the encounter with Claribel the Baronet went
to the billiard-room and amused himself with knocking
about the balls in a meditative, not to say sullen frame
of mind. Neither his interview with the Major nor
with his mother had helped to improve his temper, and
in spite of his triumphant pride in having been accepted
by Olivia Marmaduke, he remained in a savage humour
all day. To his narrow mind, the quiet manner with
which Major Varney had allowed his insolence to pass
almost unnoticed had been a convincing proof that the
Major feared him, and that he might behave as he
pleased to that gentleman. Throughout the day, there-
fore, he took every opportunity of insulting and defying
his mentor. He boasted of his own wealth and laughed
at the other's poverty; he bragged of his wines after
dinner, asking the Major if he had ever drunk such
claret as that at his mess in Bengal. Encouraged by
the Indian officer's quiet demeanour, he grew every
hour more insupportable. When remonstrated with
by Mrs. Walsingham on his ungentlemanly conduct, he
laughed aloud, and said that the Major didn't mind
him; the Major knew when he was in for a good thing,
and knew how to stick to comfortable quarters.

Lady Lisle.
“ Tell your wife to sing, Major,” said the Baronet,
later in the evening; "she can do something to amuse
us if you can't.”.
“ The Prince wishes you to sing, my Adeline,” mur-
mured the Major to his wife. “Go to the piano and
get out your music."
Mrs. Varney obeyed her husband's orders in silence,
and, having seated herself at the piano, selected a quan-
tity of music from the portfolio at her side.
“ Ask his Royal Highness what song he will be
pleased to command,” said the Major.
“O give us something Swiss,” answered Sir Rupert;
“something lively, with a tra-la-la at the end of the
verses. Olivia-I mean Lady Lisle that is to be-sings
Swiss songs, and I don't think that anybody else can
sing them half as well.”
"Mrs. Varney cannot, of course, hope to sing as well
as the future Lady Lisle,” said the Major quietly; “but
she has been pronounced by connoisseurs to possess a
decent voice, and she will do her best to please your
Highness.”
Mrs. Varney remained at the piano for some time,
pouring out ballad after ballad in her rich contralto
voice. When the young Baronet had had enough music,
he politely told her she might leave off when she liked,
and the lady left the instrument without being bored
with any oppressive gratitude for her exertions to please
him.
Arthur Walsingham, who was at home for a short
visit, looked up from the book which he was reading by
his mother's side, and said gravely,–
“ Thank you very much for your charming singing,
Mrs. Varney. My brother would thank you if he were
à gentleman. As he is, unfortunately, nothing of the
kind, allow me to do so in his stead.”
The boy had been chafing all the evening at Sir
Rupert's conduct to his guests, and he would have
spoken before had he not despised the Major for not
resenting the Baronet's insolence. Sir Rupert looked

at his step-brother for a moment as if he would have
made some reply, but said nothing. He and Arthur had
had one pugilistic encounter, after which the Baronet
had been very scrupulous in his conduct with regard to
young Walsingham. Mrs. Varney looked gratefully at
the boy for his interference.
“Your father was a gentleman, Arthur Walsingham,”
she said ; "I can afford to say that, though I had little
cause to love him; and I think you take after him.”
Never had the brilliant Major been so quiet as on this
particular evening. He sat in an easy chair by the
blazing fire, apparently half unconscious of what was
passing around him. But when, at half-past ten o'clock,
the Baronet rose from the sofa upon which he had been
lolling and walked over to the side-table, on which the
tray of bedroom candlesticks had been placed, the Major
rose from his easy chair and stood by the table, waiting
while Sir Rupert lighted his candle.
“ You're all such precious dull company," the Baronet
politely remarked, " that I shall go to bed. Well,” he
added, turning to the Major, “what are you waiting
for? Why don't you light your candle ? "
“Because I'm not going to my own room," answered
Major Varney. “ I'm coming to yours, Sir Rupert
Lisle."
Something in the Major's tone struck strangely upon
the ear of his host. Sir Rupert looked up, and, meeting
his visitor's eyes, turned deadly pale.
“I can't be kept out of my bed for any tomfoolery
to-night,” he said hastily. “I'm tired and sleepy. If
you've anything to say to me, I dare say it will keep till
to-morrow."
“I don't choose that it should keep for another hour,
Sir Rupert. I told you this morning that we must have
an explanation at a proper time. Be so good as to lead
the way to your room."
“But I tell you --" the Baronet began.
“Be so good as to lead the way,” said Major Varney
firmly, opening the drawing-room door.

Lady Lisle.
Sir Rupert hesitated for a moment, but the influxible
face of the Major cowed him, as it had often done before.
He took up his candle and led the way to his room.
Granville Varney followed him closely, and, as he entered
the room after the Baronet, shut and locked the door
behind him, putting the key into his pocket. The room
in which Sir Rupert Lisle slept was a magnificent apart-
ment, and had been the sleeping chamber of the chiefs
of Lislewood for centuries. The wainscot and ceiling
were of black oak, with the cornices and panels exqui.
sitely carved. One of the panels was more richly carved
than the rest, and was ornamented with a medallion
portrait of a mitred abbot. This was the sliding panel
which opened upon the secret staircase. The hangings
of the bedstead and windows were of violet velvet, lined
with white satin. The large apartment looked dark and
gloomy, lighted only by a pair of wax candles on the
dressing-table, and the candle carried by the Baronet.
Sir Rupert watched the Major as he put the key of the
door in his pocket.
“Why have you locked that door ?” he asked.
“Because I do not wish to be disturbed in what I
have to say to you, Sir Rupert Lisle."
The blue eyes of the Major had an almost awful
solemnity ; his smiling mouth was fixed and rigid; all
that was débonnaire, brilliant, and benevolent in his
appearance and manner had given place to a freezing air
of pride and resolution. The Baronet looked furtively
towards his dressing-table, where, amidst a crowd of
golden-stoppered crystal bottles, there was a morocco
case containing a set of razors.
"Put down your candle, Sir Rupert," said the
Major, pointing to the candlestick, “and be 80
good as to take a chair; I shall not detain you very
long."
"I hope you won't," answered the young man, with
a ghastly attempt at bravado; “I give you warning,
that if you talk long, I shall fall asleep in the middle of
what you're saying," and he affected a yawn.

“ I'm not afraid of your falling asleep in the raidst of
what I have to say, Sir Rupert Lisle.”
“Be quick about it then, pray. What is it?".
“ Sir Rupert Lisle," said the Major, looking him full
in the face," when people are so blind to their own
interests as not to be able to recognize those to whom
they owe all they possess, and in whose power it is to
destroy as well as to achieve, they are mad, and deservi
to be treated as madmen. Remember that, Sir Ruper!!
Wiser men than you have dragged out their wretched
lives in the dreary cells of a lunatic asylum. You have
chosen to insult me repeatedly in the course of this day,
and I have not chosen to resent your conduct once; not,
mark you, because I have not the power to resent it,
but because I have not the inclination. I defy anybody
to say they have ever seen me in a passion, under any
provocation whatever. I am not a good man; but I am
a good-tempered man. This gives me some influence
over the rest of the world. A good-tempered man is
always mistaken for a good man. He has a pleasant
smile and a joyous laugh. He may be plotting the ruin
of his fellow-creatures, but he will look at them without
a frown. Good temper is an accomplishment, like good
singing or good card-playing, and it is an accomplish-
ment which may be possessed by any man who will take
the trouble to acquire it. I have made it my business
to cultivate a pleasant, easy-going, amiable disposition.
If I were compelled to murder a man, I should do it
without losing my temper. When I resent an insult, I
do not resent it by angry words, but by decisive acts. If
a man insults me, I can smile and forgive him ; if he
opposes me or stands in my way, I can still smile and
crush him. Be good enough to bear this in your mind,
Sir Rupert Lisle; and beware how you offend me:"'
The young man had dragged his chair close to the
fireplace. He wanted the Major to imagine that the
shiver, which shook him from head to foot, was occa-
sioned by the cold wind of the October night.
“Nobody wanted to offend you, Major,” he said, with

Lady Lisle.
an abject smile. “If there was anything said that you
didn't like, of course it was said in joke. You're too
penetrating a man not to have seen that it was only a
joke. As to friends, why, you don't suppose I'm such
a fool as not to know that you are my best friend, and
that you've restored me to my rights; and as to any.
thing I have, of course you're welcome to share it.
There now, will that do ?" He held out his hand to
Major Varney with a sickly smile of conciliation. “Will
that do ?” he repeated.
“No," replied the Major, “not yet. There was some
talk this morning about a marriage. Did you mean
what you said then ?”
“I did,” said Sir Rupert.
“Then if you did entertain such an idea, Sir Rupert
Lisle, it will be necessary for you to renounce it.”
"To renounce it?”
“Entirely. It does not suit me that you should
marry."
"Well, upon my word,” said the Baronet, with a
forced laugh, “I think you are carrying it a little too
far, Major Varney. Of course, as I said before, any-
thing of mine is at your service. You're welcome to
the use of my house, and you're welcome to the use of
my cheque-book; but you're not welcome to interfere
with my choice of a wife; that's rather too good a
joke!”
“ You'll find it very far from a joke, Sir Rupert, if
you try to go on with this matter. If there is any
engagement between yourself and Miss Olivia Marma-
duke, that engagement must be broken off.”
“That it shall never be !” exclaimed the Baronet,
striking his hand upon the table. “That it shall never
be! Neither for you nor for any other man breathing
will I give up Olivia Marmaduke. In a month from
this day she shall be Lady Lisle.”
“Fool!” cried the Major. No Lady Lisle shall ever
enter these doors while I am alive to prevent it. No
heir shall ever be born to you, to rob me of the fortune

which, but for me, you would never have possessed.
No extravagant woman shall ever waste the thousands
which, but for the combinations of my intellect, would
now be in the hands of a stranger. You would marry !
You would bring a mistress to rule over this household !
You would make Olivia Marmaduke Lady Lisle! You,
who but for me, might have lived in a workhouse or
died in a gaol! Heaven help you if you force me to
turn against you the engines which for fourteen years
have been working for your interests!”
“I don't know what you mean,” said the young man,
with the sulky determination which, with him, stood in
the place of courage ; “but I know this—that, come
what may, I'll stick to what I said, and Olivia Marma-
duke shall be my wife.”
“She shall never be Lady Lisle," replied the Major,
unlocking the door of the room. “Good night, lord of
Lislewood. You have taken your course and I must
take mine. There are two or three little matters con-
nected with your interests which you do not seem to
understand. I shall send Mr. Salamons to explain them
to you."
Sir Rupert undressed and went to bed. He had been
asleep about half an hour, when he was awakened by
Mr. Alfred Salamons, who stood at the bedside, with a
candle in his hand. The young man liked Mr. Sala-
mons much better than he liked that gentleman's master,
and he was not at all alarmed by the apparition of the
Jewish valet.
“ Well, what is it, Salamons ? " he asked.
“O, nothing very particular; only a few words I
have to say to you from my master.”
"Say them quickly then, and let me go to sleep
again."
“ Why, you see, Sir Rupert,” said the valet, looking
round the room cautiously, “they say that walls have
ears, and you never know when people are on the listen;
so, as what I've got to tell you is a bit of a secret,
perhaps I had better whisper it.”

Mr. Salamons bent his lips close to the Baronet's ear,
and whispered two or three sentences.
Sir Rupert Lisle burst out laughing. He laughed till
his shoulders shook under the bedclothes.
“Is that all ? ” he said, when he had done laughing.
" Is that all that such a clever man as Major Granville
Varney could send you here to tell me? Tell him, with
my compliments, that I've known it all along, and that
I shall marry Olivia Marmaduke in less than a month
from to-night."
CHAPTER XXI.
SIR RUPERT'S COURTSHIP.
In the struggle between intellect and cunning, the
lower faculty bad conquered. After that midnight
revelation made by Mr. Alfred Salamons, Sir Rupert
Lisle took the reins of government into his own hands,
and made himself completely master of his own house.
The young man no longer looked on every occasion to
his friend the Major for advice; that gentleman had
evidently lost his power over his pupil. To the narrow
mind of Sir Rupert Lisle, the man who had once op-
posed him appeared ever afterwards in the light of an
enemy. He avoided the Major as much as possible,
and spent most of his time in riding backwards and
forwards from Lislewood Park to the Grove. Olivia
Marmaduke had never altered her manner to him; she
received him with the same indifference that she had
evinced on the occasion of his first visit; she laughed
at his awkwardness, quizzed his stupid speeches, ridi.
culed his attempted compliments, but fascinated him
every day more and more. There seemed to be some-
thing craven in his nature, which made him most love
and admire this girl when she most openly proclaimed
her contempt for him. He followed her about like a do

177
of jewellery. He wanted Mrs. Walsingham to surrender
the Lislewood diamonds, which were kept at the family
banker's; but Claribel refused to give them up until
her son's wedding day. “It will be time enough then,
Rupert,” she said ; "something might happen before
that to break off the match.”
“Nothing shall break off the match, except death !"
exclaimed the Baronet passionately.
Once, and once only, he had attempted to remonstrate
with Olivia Marmaduke upon her conduct towards him.
“You treat me like a dog," he said. “You laugh at
me and make a fool of me. Upon my word, Livy, I
don't believe you have a spark of love for me.”
He had been dining at the Grove, and he was standing
by Olivia's side at the piano, while two of her sisters
and the Colonel were congregated round the fireplace.
“Don't you?” she said indifferently, twisting a
diamond bracelet round her wrist. “ Perhaps you had
better always think that. Do you remember, when you
proposed to me a fortnight ago, how very unsentimental
we were? It was only Will you consent to become
Lady Lisle ?' and 'Yes, Sir Rupert, I will.' I am not
of a very romantic turn of mind, I assure you.”
"No, I know you are not!” answered the Baronet
bitterly. " Egad! I think if I were not Sir Rupert
Lisle, and the rightful owner of the Lislewood estates,
I should have a very poor chance with you, Miss
Livy."
so I think you would, Sir Rupert. Pray let us never
quarrel about that. Heaven forbid that I should deceive
you! Yes, you are quite right; I marry you for your
title, and I marry you for your estate, and if you had
neither title nor estate, I wouldn't marry you. I am
candid enough-am I not? And now, if the honest
truth displeases you, let us shake hands, and say 'good-
bye.' I am quite willing to do so, I assure you." She
held out her hand, which glittered and blazed with the
rings her lover had given her. The light of the gems
seemed to catch her eye, for she said, laughing, “Of

course, if we part, I shall send you back all your pre
sents; so don't be deterred from accepting your release
by any uncomfortable recollection of the money you have
spent upon me."
" I'd spend every farthing I have in the world upon
you, Livy, and I won't accept any release, or let you
off from your engagement,” he said passionately. “It
seems very hard that you don't love me, when I love
you so much ; but whether you marry me for myself, or
whether you marry me for my fortune, I must and will
have you, for I can't live without you."
Later in the evening, as Olivia and Sir Rupert were
seated at a small table playing backgammon, the eldest
Miss Marmaduke came into the drawing-room where
they sat. She had been dining at the Rectory, and had
only just come home. The Colonel was asleep in his
easy chair by the fireplace. Lucy and Jane, the second
and third sisters, looked up from their crochet.
“How have you enjoyed yourself, Laura ?” asked
Jane.
“O, not very particularly. We had rather a dull
evening; but I must not forget, by the bye, to tell
you a piece of news I heard from the rector.” She
glanced, as she spoke, rather maliciously towards her
sister Olivia.
“O pray, Laura, if you have any news, let us hear
it,” said that young lady, suppressing a yawn. “Shut
up the board, Sir Rupert; I have won five games of
you. Now, Laura," she said, rising from her chair,
á let us hear what you have to tell us.”
She looked superbly handsome in the yellow light of
the wax candles and the red blaze of the fire. Her neck
and arms were resplendent with the jewels given to her
by the Baronet. Her beauty, her pride, and her splen-
dour filled her elder sister with hate and envy, and she
determined to stab this proud heart to the inmost core.
The Colonel woke at the sound of his daughters' voices,
and looked about him. His eyes fixed themselves fondly
apon his favourite child.

Sir Rupert's Courtship.
179
“Papa, you remember Walter Remorden, Mr. Mil.
ward's last curate?” said Laura.
“Remember him ? yes, of course. He left here three
years ago, and got a curacy at some place near Chiches.
ter. Walter Remorden was the best friend the poor of
Lislewood ever had. He was a very worthy fellow, and
a great favourite of mine. I should be glad to see him
again."
Laura had been watching her youngest sister during
this speech of the Colonel's. A sombre darkness had
spread itself like a veil over Olivia's handsome face.
“Well, papa," continued Miss Marmaduke, poor
Walter Remorden has been compelled to abandon his
duties on account of his very delicate health, Mrs. Mil-
ward says. He was born in Lislewood, you know, and
it seems he had some invalid fancy that his native air
would do him good ; so that dear good Mrs. Milward
very kindly invited him to the Rectory."
"What!” exclaimed the Colonel, “is Walter Re.
morden staying at the Rectory?"
“Yes; he only arrived yesterday. He has been
dreadfully ill, and is quite a wreck they say. But I
must not bore Sir Rupert by talking of an invalid
curate. Such congratulations, Olivia. Everybody is
talking of the future Lady Lisle, and congratulating
me upon my sister's brilliant prospects.”
Olivia had neither stirred nor spoken since Walter
Remorden's name had been mentioned, but after these
last words of Laura’s she burst into a strange hysterical
laugh, and walked out of the room.
The Colonel started from his chair. “Livy!” he
exclaimed, following her into the hall, “what is it?
My darling, my pet-what is the matter?”
“ I know what it was," muttered Sir Rupert. “It
was that man's name. I saw her face change when you
mentioned it,” he said, turning to Miss Marmaduke;
“but let him look out, for, whoever he is, I'll be the
death of him if he tries to come between her and me."
The Colonel and Olivia returned in a few minutes, the

old man leading his daughter, with his arm round her
waist. Her eyes were tearless, but they had a feverish
lustre in them. Her lover did not attempt to address
her, but sat watching her in sulky silence for about a
quarter of an hour, and then rose to take his depar-
ture.
“Good night, Olivia,” he said, drawing her aside,
after he had taken leave of the rest of the party.
“You've told me plain enough to-night that you don't
love me, and you've told me something more quite as
plainly. I'm very much obliged to you."
She looked at him with an expression of supreme
contempt. “Remember, I offered you your release to-
night,” she said, “and I am ready to repeat the same
offer to-morrow. Good night.”
Early the next morning Sir Rupert rode over to the
Grove, and asked for a private interview with his be-
trothed. He had come to implore her to fix the day for
their wedding within the following three weeks. He
found it singularly easy to obtain her consent to his
wishes. “Let it be when you please, Sir Rupert,” she
said—“if you still please that the wedding shall take
place at all.”
“ Olivia," he exclaimed, “ if I still please- "
“You may have seen enough to cause an alteration
in your feelings towards me. If it is so, speak to me
as frankly as I have spoken to you; but remember that,
whether our union result in happiness or misery, you
are entrapped into it by no act of mine."
Upon this the young Baronet repeated his declara-
tion, that nothing could turn him from his purpose, and
Olivia consented to fix upon the day which he wished
for the wedding without further parley. A rich maiden
aunt, who had never given any of her nieces a five-
pound note in the whole course of their lives, had sent
the future Lady Lisle a letter of congratulation and a
couple of hundred pounds for her trousseau. The dreary
old house was noisy with the chatter of dressmakerg
and milliners. But Olivia took no interest in the achieve

ment of these busy needlewomen. She shut herself in
her own room, and could with difficulty be induced to
look at her dresses, or to have them fitted on. “How
you worry me about the stupid silks and satins !” she
said impatiently. “You know I never cared for such
finery, and I care less now. For Heaven's sake, Laura,
let us hear no more of them!”
“Upon my word, Olivia, the future Lady Lisle has a
charming temper! I pity Sir Rupert."
“Pity him, Laura !” repeated Olivia, fixing her black
eyes upon her sister's face; “pity him with your whole
heart, poor fellow, for he needs your pity!"
CHAPTER XXII.
IT IS BEST TO BE OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE, ETC.
SIR RUPERT had presented his future bride with a
thorough-bred bay horse-a magnificent animal, which
had been carefully broken in for Miss Marmaduke by
an experienced trainer. Strange to say, however, the
young lady, who had never seemed tired of galloping
about the downs upon the ill-looking grey borrowed
from the farmer's stables, showed no inclination what-
ever to avail herself of Sir Rupert's present. She had
not ridden the bay above three times. She seemed to
have an antipathy to leaving the house. She would
plead a headache, or her horror of the dreary November
weather, when Sir Rupert begged to be allowed to
escort her for a ride. Her temper was strange and fitful
during these latter days. She answered impatiently
when her sisters spoke to her, and seemed to do her
utmost to avoid their society. With ber father she was
grave and silent, and to Sir Rupert cold, reserved and
gloomy. It was altogether a most dreary courtship.
The Baronet watched every change in his future bride
with a nervous anxiety. Ever since she had offered to
release him from his engagement he had been tormented

Lady Lisle.
by the fear that she would herself refuse, perhaps at the
very last, to fulfil her promise.
"You are as white as a ghost, Livy," he said one
morning, “and you have great hollow circles round
your eyes. I know you will be ill, and then something
will happen to part us. Livy, Livy, you must and shall
be my wife.” He caught hold of her two slender hands,
and pressed them passionately in his own, as if he had
been seized with a sudden terror of losing her. “Olivia,
why don't you take more air and exercise ? Laura says
that you shut yourself in your own room half the day
What can I do to please you, or to amuse you? I'll
spend half my fortune in a day, if you like. What can
I do?"
“Nothing,” she said; “ only leave me to myself. I
dare say I am very disagreeable; perhaps I am very
wicked. I am fighting out a battle with my own heart.
Only leave me alone, and it will soon be over, and I
shall be myself again.”
“I can't make you out, Olivia," replied her lover;
“but I'll do anything you tell me, if you'll only pro-
mise to be my wife.”
Sir Rupert left the Grove soon after this. Olivia sat
by the fire at her father's feet, while he dozed in his
easy chair. The four elder sisters were seated by one
of the windows, availing themselves of the last rays of
winter light. Presently Olivia started from the foot-
stool upon which she had been sitting, and left the room.
She returned in a few minutes, dressed in her bonnet
and shawl.
“Why, where in goodness' name are you going,
Olivia ?” Laura asked, looking up from her work.
“ To Lislewood Rectory, to see Mrs. Milward,"
answered her sister quietly.
“You've chosen a curious time for your visit, Livy,"
said Laura. “I didn't know you had a taste for walk-
ing in such weather as this. Besides, it will be dark
before you get to the Rectory. You'd better wait until
after your marriage, and then you can go there as Lady

Lisle. Walter Remorden is to stay with the Milwards
till after Christmas."
“Laura Marmaduke !” cried her sister, “you have
not half as good a heart as my dog. When he sees me
unhappy he tries to comfort me in his poor dumb way.
But when you see me miserable and remorseful, you
take delight in my misery and my remorse. I declare
to you, that I would go to the Rectory this day if all
Lislewood were to know of my visit, and guess the
reason of it. So say what you like of me, and think
what you like of me, and good afternoon to you.” With
which salutation Olivia bounced out of the room, bang.
ing the door after her.
What shall I say of my heroine ? for, unfortunately,
faulty and imperfect as this young lady may be, she is
nevertheless my heroine. What shall I say of her ?
She has by no means an amiable temper. She is vehe.
ment and impulsive. But, on the other hand, she is
generous and truthful, and when she has been rude to
her sisters, she will go to them half an hour after the
skirmish in which she has come off victor, and will im-
plore them to forgive her, and will betray such humility
and contrition, that the ladies would be hard of heart
indeed if they could not bring themselves to excuse
her. She loves her father with a proud and jealous
fondness, which delights the Colonel, but which, in
some manner, deprives him of the affection of his elder
daughters; for Miss Olivia takes it very ill if any one
but herself presumes to love her papa.
The drizzling rain and the cold wintry fog closed in
around her upon this dark November afternoon, as she
turned into a lonely country lane which led from the
Colonel's house into Lislewood village. Olivia had put
on her oldest bonnet, and wrapped herself carelessly in
a great woollen shawl. Her dog had followed her with.

little way, he came bounding round her, splashing her
dress with his muddy fore feet. She fell on her knees
upon the wet ground, and put her arms about the

animal's neck. “My Box, my faithful honest Box! I
remember the day he stooped down to lay his hand upon
your head, and kissed you here upon your rough shaggy
brow.” And she pressed her lips passionately to the
dog's forehead, as if there were some association which
made the animal more than ordinarily dear to her.
“How silly I am!” she said, resuming her walk;
"how weak and foolish! What will they think of me
for this visit? What mischief it will do to myself, if
it causes no harm to others! As if I were not mad
enough and unhappy enough as it is! But I must
go-I must, must, must go !”.
She hurried through Lislewood, and walked across
the churchyard to a low white gate that opened into
the Rectory garden. Here she stopped, and leaned for
some minutes against the low wall which separated the
churchyard from Mr. Milward's lawn and shrubbery.
“I have a good mind to go back,” she said to herself,
presently. “I think the walk has done me good, and,
at least, I have been near him-near him without his
knowing it. There are no lights in the upper windows.
He is not confined to his room, then. He cannot be so
very ill. He is in the drawing-room, no doubt," she
added, looking at the broad bay window, through which
streamed the light of a lamp. “Yes, yes, I will go
home.”
She was leaving the gate, when a woman crossed the
churchyard and came towards the Rectory. The woman,
who was one of the rector's servants, knew Miss Mar-
maduke very well, and recognized her on this occasion
by the dog Box, who was as well known in Lislewood
as his mistress.
“Miss Olivia Marmaduke!” said the woman; “Lord,
if I wasn't wondering who it was a-standing at master's
gate, when I see your dog Box, and then I knowed it
was you. You've been to see missus, miss ?”
“ No," stammered Olivia, blushing under her veil.
“But you're a-going, miss, ain't you? Missus was
a-talking of you only yesterday, and a-saying how she do

want to see you. And Mr. Remorden, miss—you re.
member-him as was so intimate up at your house, and
such a favourite with your papa-he be come back on
a visit to master, and you never saw such a change,
miss- but you'll come in and see missus, miss?"
the woman repeated, checking herself.
“Yes,” said Olivia abruptly ; “ I'll come.”
The woman led the way through the narrow shrub-
bery walk, and across the well-kept garden. The dark
outlines of the leafless trees swam before Olivia's eyes,
and ere she could collect her senses, the servant had
ushered her into Mrs. Milward's pretty drawing-room,
and she was standing in a broad glare of light, and in
the presence of three people. These three were the
rector, who was seated at a side-table, writing; his
wife, who sat at work by the fireplace; and a young
man, who lay on a sofa, wheeled close to the other side
of the hearth. This young man was Walter Remorden,
the late curate of Lislewood.
“My dear, this is kind of you," said Mrs. Milward,
shaking hands with Olivia. “I thought you had quite
forgotten us, and here you have had the courage to
come to see us on such an evening as this. I declare
your shawl is quite wet. I will give it to Susan, to be
dried for you, my dear, for of course you will stay and
take tea."
Olivia silently submitted to the removal of her shawl.
She had neither spoken nor lifted her veil since enter-
ing the room. She made no response to the rector's
salutation, or to the far colder greeting from the invalid.
She sat rubbing her wet gloves one over the other, and
twisting and untwisting her slender fingers. Her dog,'
who was familiar with the Rectory household, had fol-
lowed her into the drawing-room, and sat in the centre
of the hearth-rug, looking about him complacently.
Walter Remorden was a man of about thirty years of
age. His complexion was dark, and tanned by exposure
to the air and sun. His hair was the darkest shade of
chestnut, and clustered about his broad low forehead in

thick curls. His eyes were grey, large, clear and ex-
pressive. Ill as he was, he was ten times more manly
in appearance than the young Baronet. He had been
reading a newspaper when Olivia entered the room, and
after his brief salutation, he resumed the perusal of it,
holding it in such a manner that it entirely shaded his
face.
Mrs. Milward had plenty to say. She made Olivia
remove her bonnet, and the curate lowered his paper for
a moment to look at Miss Marmaduke's pale face. Olivia
answered all Mrs. Milward's inquiries. She was even
able to talk of Sir Rupert Lisle, and the preparations
for her coming marriage ; but she could not overcome
the feeling that there was something strange in her own
voice, and that it must sound as unnatural to others as
it did to herself. Years afterwards she could, at any
moment, recall the picture of the pretty lighted room,
the recumbent figure upon the sofa, the curate's dark
hair just visible above the paper which concealed his
face, the bright red curtains and the blazing fire, the
pictures upon the walls—the very rattling of the cups
and saucers, and the hissing of the urn, as the servant
brought in the tea-things. All these most trifling de-
tails, which made up the background of this painful
scene in her life, were stamped at once and for ever upon
her memory.
After tea, Mr. Milward left the house to attend a vestry
meeting, while Mrs. Milward resumed her work, and
settled herself for a pleasant chat with Olivia. Miss
Marmaduke had fully intended to restrict her visit to
half an hour at the utmost; but she lingered, yielding
again and again to Mrs. Milward's entreaties to stop a
little longer, rather from an inability to make the effort
of leaving, than from any pleasure she derived from her
stay.
“Now, my dear,” said the rector's wife triumphantly,
as her husband left the room, “you cannot possibly go
till Mr. Milward returns, for, of course, he must see you
home."

“ Papa will very likely send for me, when he finds 1
stay,” Olivia said indifferently.
Walter Remorden had dropped his newspaper, and
languidly joined in the conversation. When Mr. Milward
had been gone about half an hour, Mrs. Milward was
summoned to reply to some applicant for relief, who was
waiting to see her in the kitchen. Left alone with the
curate, Olivia sat for some time silently caressing her
dog, who had laid his head affectionately upon her knee.
* When do you return to your curacy near Chichester,
Mr. Remorden?” she said at last, when the silence had
become painfully embarrassing.
“I doubt if I shall return to it at all, Miss Marma-
duke,” the invalid answered quietly. “I am offered a
curacy at Belminster, in Yorkshire, which promises to
be in every respect more advantageous.”
Olivia scarcely seemed to hear what he said, but sat
pulling her dog's ears and looking thoughtfully into the
fire ; presently she said, with strange suddenness,
“Walter Remorden, how utterly you must despise
me!”
He had been so entirely calm and self-possessed
before, even when he could have scarcely failed to per-
ceive her agitation, that a stranger would have set him
down as incapable of any strong emotion, but as Olivia
spoke his face changed, and he lifted one thin hand
entreatingly, as he exclaimed, -
“For pity's sake, for the sake of all that is merciful
and womanly, do not speak one word to recall the past.
I have wrestled hard. I have prayed so many prayers
that I might be able to bear my sufferings, and it is not
for you to reopen old wounds, which are healed, which
are healed,” he repeated passionately. “I live for
nothing in this world but to do my duty as a minister
of the Gospel. For that end I pray to be restored to
health and strength; though, Heaven forgive me the
day has been when I have wished that I might never
leave this house, except to be carried to one of yonder
graves "

Lady Lisle.
Olivia had never taken her eyes from the fire during
this speech.
“I am very glad your recovery has been so complete,"
she said, with a strange laugh; “I have less reason to
reproach myself for that which must seem--what indeed
it is the cold blooded treachery of an ambitious and
mercenary woman, anxious only for her own advantage.
I know I am a base and sordid creature, and I hate
myself for my meanness. But I had grown so weary of
poverty, and I suppose Sir Rupert's title and Sir
Rupert's estate dazzled and maddened me, till I forgot
the promise which I made two years ago to you. I have
suffered very much; but I am glad that I came here
to-night, as this interview sets all my fears at rest. You
see, through reading so many novels, I had taken it into
my head that a man's heart was very easily broken."
It is impossible to say what reply Mr. Remorden
might have made to this speech; for as Olivia finished
speaking, the door was suddenly opened, and Sir Rupert
Lisle burst into the room. He flung himself into a chair
without removing his hat or noticing the presence of
the curate.
“I've been down to the Grove, Miss Marmaduke," he
said, his voice betraying suppressed rage, “and Laura
told me where you had come. So I thought, as it isn't
quite the thing for the future Lady Lisle to be streaming
through Lislewood street alone after dark, I'd come here
to fetch you."
“I should not have streamed through Lislewood street
alone after dark, Sir Rupert," answered Olivia, flashing
the lightning of her black eyes upon the angry Baronet;
“ there are people in this house who know as well what
is due to Olivia Marmaduke—who is of quite as much
consequence as the future Lady Lisle-as yourself, be-
lieve me. Take off your hat, Sir Rupert!” she added,
in a tone of command, “and let me introduce you to
Mr. Remorden, my papa's esteemed friend."
Whatever suspicions the Baronet might have bar-
boured, whatever jealous fury he might have felt, there

was something in the manner of Olivia Marmaduke
which immediately subdued her lover. He acknowledged
Mr. Remorden's bow by a sulky nod, and even went so
far as to mutter something about being glad to make his
acquaintance; of which condescension the curate took
no notice whatever.
i “I want you to come home, Livy,” he said ; I can't
endure my life without you; I dined at home to-night;
but I was so dull and wretched after dinner, that I was
obliged to have the chestnut saddled and ride over to
the Grove. It's raining hard; but I've got the fly from
the Crown Inn waiting for you. Do come, Livy."
“I will come as soon as I have wished Mrs. Milward
good night, Sir Rupert,” she said; and the young man
left the room to give some directions to the driver of
the fiy.
Directly Sir Rupert was gone, Walter Remorden rose,
with an effort, from the sofa upon which he had been
lying, and stood by Olivia's side before the fireplace,
supporting himself against the mantel-piece.
“Olivia,” he said, in a voice which trembled with
emotion, “there is no dishonour in my asking you if
this marriage is irrevocably determined upon ? "
“It is.”
“ And it is no longer in your power to withdraw from
your engagement to this man?”
“It is no longer in my power.”
“Heaven help you, then, unhappy girl! I dare not
urge you to that which you would feel to be dishonour.
able, even for your own happiness. But oh, Olivia, had I
seen this man before you pledged your word to him, I
would have entreated you, upon my knees, to reject
his proposals. I thought that you might not, perhaps,
love him. I fancied that his position might have in-
fluenced you; but I thought that at least he was a
gentleman."
Mrs. Milward and Sir Rupert returned to the room
before Olivia could reply, and in ten minutes she was
Beated in the fly, with the Baronet riding by her side

upon his chestnut mare. She shuddered as she looked
through the rain-blotted windows at the dim figure of
the young man.
“I feel as if I were in a prison,” she said to herself,
“ with that man for my gaoler."
CHAPTER XXIII
OLIVIA'S WEDDING.
On the last day of November a long line of carriages
extended from the churchyard wall half-way down the
little village street, waiting for the aristocratic assembly
gathered in the church to witness the marriage of Sir
Rupert Lisle to Olivia Marmaduke. The Baronet de-
clared that he had no idea of doing the thing shabbily.
He wanted everybody in Sussex to know of his mar-
riage with the handsomest woman in the county. So
invitations were issued far and wide in every direction.
A staff of Gunter's men brought the breakfast and the
wedding cake down to the Park; for Sir Rupert had
insisted, in defiance of everybody, that the breakfast
should be given at his house, and not at the Grove.
"You can give a breakfast yourself if you like," he
said to the Colonel ;' but I don't suppose you've house-
room for half the county, and I mean half the county
to be at my wedding, I can tell you."
So Olivia Marmaduke walked to the altar amidst
a crowd of splendidly-dressed women and fashionable
men. Costly silks filled the solemn aisle. Mechlin
lace and snowy plumes, wondrous artificial flowers,
which trembled under the dew upon their petals; gold
and jewelled-stoppered scent-bottles, and a hundred
other beautiful and expensive braveries, were so common
amongst the assembly that the rustic charity children
and the villagers, who crowded every nook and corner,
had not eyes enough to stare at all that was to be seen,

Olivia's Wedding.
191
and went away at last with only a dim confused notion
of the splendid show.
The Lislewood beadle, with an immense satin favour
pinned on to his new waistcoat, was especially sharp
in his manner to the humble villagers that morning.
He hustled them out of the pews, driving them into
obscure corners, and pushing them behind pillars, and
seeming altogether as if he could hardly find it in his
heart to allow them to exist at all upon such an
occasion.
“Now really,” he said reproachfully, to every fresh
rustic who presented himself, “ if I'd knowed there'd
been so many of you a-comin' to, poke your noses in, I'd
have made my arrangements accordin'."
A bishop, distantly related to the Lisle family, came
all the way from the west of England to celebrate the
marriage; and probably that clerical dignitary was a
little surprised at the manners and conduct of his rich
kinsman, Sir Rupert. Perhaps the Baronet had never
appeared to worse advantage than upon this eventful
morning. The agitation attendant on his position of
bridegroom had blanched his cheeks to a ghastly white-
ness, while the end of his sharp pinched nose was red-
dened by the raw cold of the November day. His
clothes seemed to fit him badly, and to become him
worse. The very hothouse flower which he had placed
in his button-hole dropped its petals and withered and
shrank, as if it had been blighted by contact with
anything so mean. He dropped his hat in the middle
of the aisle, and it went rolling down to the end of
the church, causing a suppressed tittering amongst the
fashionable crowd, and one or two loud guffaws, speedily
checked by the beadle, from the humbler spectators.
His hand, when he gave it to Olivia, to lead her to the
altar, was cold and clammy, and shook like a leaf.
The bride, on the contrary, was superb in her haughty
loveliness. Everybody in Lislewood had always con-
sidered Olivia Marmaduke a handsome girl; but they
had rarely seen her beauty set off by anything more

becoming than a shabby riding-habit, or a coarse straw

lilies, and with a veil of the richest Honiton lace falling
about her like a snowy cloud, the Colonel's daughter
looked like an empress, and an audible murmur of ad-
miration broke from the crowd as her father led her up
the aisle.
! Mrs. Walsingham, who, at forty years of age, was
still a beautiful woman, was simply dressed in pale grey
silk; but Mrs. Major Varney wore an amber brocade,
which glittered in the sunshine like a robe of gold. Her
beauty was more gorgeous even than that of the bride,
and people asked each other who that Jewish-looking
woman in the yellow dress was, and where she had
sprung from.
The Major seemed perfectly reconciled to the marriage
which he had first so seriously opposed. He looked the
picture of good humour. His expanse of light waist-
coat seemed broader than ever. Perhaps an interview
which he had had with Sir Rupert Lisle the night before
may have had something to do with all this radiant
good temper. It had been a very serious interview
indeed, and it had been ended by Mr. Salamons being
summoned to act as witness to some document drawn
up by the Major, and signed by the young man. So
peace was restored in the house of Lislewood, and the
bishop read the solemn service, which made Olivia
Marmaduke and the young man, whose cold damp hand
trembled in hers, man and wife; and the long line of
carriages drove back to Lislewood Park, where there
was feasting and flirting, and small-talk and scandal,
and where, perhaps, not half a dozen amongst the
people assembled had one thought of the happiness
or the misery of the newly-married pair, who drove
off at about three o'clock, amidst the clanging of the
Lislewood bells, on their journey across country to
Folkestone, whence they were to start for the Con-
tinent.

" What do we Here, my Heart and I?" 193
Colonel Marmaduke and his four daughters stayed
to dine at the Park with Mi's. Walsingham and her
younger son, and Major and Mrs. Varney. They were
a very snug little party. Claribel was far more cheer-
ful in the absence of Sir Rupert than when blessed
by that gentleman's society, and on this particular
evening the Major made himself even more agreeable
than usual. The ladies from the Grove looked wonder-
ingly round the splendid drawing-room, as they sat
there after dinner. All this wealth, luxury, and mag-
nificence were to belong henceforth to their sister.
“How well Lady Lisle looked this morning!" said
the Major.
Mrs. Walsingham started at the mention of the
name which had once been her own. Olivia's four
sisters felt a simultaneous thrill of envy at the sound.
Lady Lisle! Yes, it was really true-she was indeed
Lady Lisle !
CHAPTER XXIV.
“WHAT DO WE HERE, MY HEART AND IP".
The very day after that upon which Sir Rupert's
wedding was celebrated, Walter Remorden turned his
back upon the quiet little Sussex village where he had
been born. It was a bitter pain to him to leave the
quiet village sheltered by those familiar hills, for he
loved his birthplace with that deep love a man so often
has for some obscure spot, which, though not altogether
lovable in itself, is dearer to him by the strong power
of association than all the rest of the universe. He
looked longingly back at the broad bare downs as the
express train carried him Londonwards. They were
beautiful to him even under the cold grey of the Novem-
ber sky. As he watched the changing and ridgy lines
cut sharply out against that wintry sky, he thought
Sussex the most beautiful county in the world. “I

Lady Lisle.
am homesick already," he said to himself, “ and I have
not come above twenty miles of my journey. How bitter
it seems to me to go so far from all to whom I have
attached myself. But I could never have stayed at
Lislewood to see Olivia Marmaduke that man's wife.”
Walter Remorden had chosen to accept this York.

from the neighbourhood of the woman he had loved. Mr.
Milward had been promised a better living than that of
Lislewood, and the curate had every chance of succeed.
ing his old rector, for the bishop of the diocese was fully
aware of the young man's popularity. But Providence
bad so ordained it that this man, of all others, should
take up his abode in the obscure town of Belminster;
and on the evening after Olivia Marmaduke's wedding-
day Walter Remorden arrived at his destination.
Now, this very Belminster was the same quiet York.
shire town to which Mr. Alfred Salamons had made
a journey in the August of the same year, and it was
in nowise altered since the visit of that gentleman.
The same solitary porter and the same all-important
inspector were in attendance at the railway station,
the same advertisements decorated the walls, the same
clerk dozed in the ticket office, the same pamphlets
and magazines adorned the bookstall,-one would have
expected to find the same stale buns and fly-blown
soda-water bottles in the refreshment room. At the
inn, to which a musty-smelling fly, drawn by a horse
which had once won a race upon the course outside
the town, conveyed Walter and his luggage; the ap-
pearance of a traveller caused mingled consternation
and delight. The good old coaching days were past,
and the chief hostelry at Belminster was six times
too large for its present uses. Very little custom came
to the decayed old inn. A few tradesmen lounged
into the parlour every evening to drink their glasses
of prime old ale ur brandy-and-water, as the case
might be, and to come to unfriendly words upon the
merits and demerits of the two members for Belminster.


## p. 195 (#199) ############################################

“ What do we Here, my Heart and I!”
195
Sometimes a commercial traveller, who had come to
Belminster to push some new article in the grocery,
or the haberdashery, or the fancy-goods line, amongst
the snug little shopkeepers, would take a bit of dinner
in the coffee-room : but a gentleman who wished to
stay all night, and might perhaps, as he said, stay for
a day or two, was indeed a person to be treated with
distinction. So Walter was escorted up a broad stair-
case into an old-fashioned sitting-room, where a blazing
fire had been lighted for his comfort, and in which
there was a mirror and a picture of the minster, and
a portrait of the horse that had won the Belminster
gold cup. The landlady, who had discovered from
Walter's portmanteau that he was the Mr. Remorden
who was coming to Belminster as curate, drew up
the blind and showed him the parish church, which
was directly opposite the window.
“The minster is at the other end of the town, sir,"
she said ; “but your church, St. Clement's that is, is
accounted as fine a building, and is, I'm told, the oldest
of the two."
The young man looked languidly enough at the dusky
shape of the fine old edifice on the other side of the
broad market place. It was difficult for him to take
any interest in his new duties. But he made an effort,
and roused himself sufficiently to talk to his hostess
about the place that was so strange to him. He asked
a great many questions about the poor of the place,
while his landlady spread the table with a meal
which would have been more than sufficient for a dozen
hearty eaters, and the whole of which,-cheesecakes,
jam turnovers, hot seed-cakes and plum-cakes, broiled
ham and eggs, and a cold fowl,—she included under
the modest denomination of a cup of tea. She was
very proud of being able to enlighten the new curate
on the subject of his parishioners, and she told Mr.
Remorden enough, while she was pouring out his tea,
to convince him that there was plenty for him to do
in Belminster, and that, whatever his troubles might

be, he would have very little time for any idle regrets
or wicked repining.
“ If there is one thing more beautiful than another
in that faith, in reforming which we have done away
with much that was estimable," mused the curate later
in the evening, “it is that utter self-abnegation which
the Roman Catholic Church demands of a man who
takes up her banner. No pang of disappointed love
can distract his heart from the hard round of duty;
for he must put all earthly affections behind him before
he calls himself a soldier of the Church. The world
and he have parted company, and the sorrows of the
world can touch him little more than its joys. In the
crowded streets, as in the cloister, he lives alone for
the performance of the duty allotted to him."
CHAPTER XXV.
BIR RUPERT'S RECEPTION OF AN OLD FRIEND.
SIR RUPERT and Lady Lisle were absent on their bridal
tour for upwards of six months. They visited all the
beautiful cities of Italy; they loitered side by side amidst
the ruins of the Coliseum, and glided noiselessly in their
gondola through those wondrous streets which the
pencil of Canaletti has made familiar to the civilized
world. If the influence of all that is loveliest in art and
nature could have given birth to one sympathetic feeling
between these two unsympathetic natures, such a feeling
might well have arisen amid the scenes through which
the husband and wife travelled together. But the love
of the beautiful was not an attribute of Sir Rupert's
nature; and whatever enthusiasm might have been
excited in Olivia's breast she kept sternly locked from
her companion.
The chestnuts were full in bloom when Sir Rupert
Lisle drove his handsome wife through the gates of
Lislewood Park, on the evening of their return. Colonel

Marmaduke and his four daughters were waiting in the
portico, with Mrs. Walsingham, to receive the travellers.
The old man was impatient to clasp his favourite child
in his arms. The sisters were anxious to see how
Olivia would support her new position, and whether the
wife of the young Baronet had won happiness by her
brilliant marriage. Lady Lisle's letters had been brief
and unsatisfactory. She had never in her life been a
good correspondent, and since her marriage she had
seemed to avoid all confidence between herself and her
family. Sir Rupert descended from the high phaeton
which he had been driving, and, flinging the reins to
one of his grooms, strolled off towards the stables, with
merely a nod of recognition to his mother and the rest
of the group assembled in the portico.
“Rupert, where are you going?” exclaimed Mrs.
Walsingham, as the Colonel ran down the steps, to hand
his daughter from the phaeton.
“To the stables, to smoke a pipe,” answered the
young man. “I've been mewed up long enough in a
railway carriage. I want to stretch my legs a bit.”
Continental travelling had done very little for Sir
Rupert Lisle. If there is any peculiar polish to be
attained by contact with the more refined inhabitants
of foreign cities, Sir Rupert had failed to attain it. Per.
haps this foreign polish, whatever its nature may be,
requires a certain smoothness in the surface upon which
it is to be spread, and may refuse to adhere to the coarse
texture of certain cross-grained woods. If there is any
refining influence in the contemplation of beautiful and
sublime scenery, in the sight of perfect and unapproach-
able works of art, in the sound of music, in the gorgeous
colouring of Italian skies, the innocent faces of lovely
peasant women-if, I say, there is in all these a refining
influence which rarely fails to improve the most ordinary
mind, that influence had produced no effect upon the
sullen nature of Sir Rupert Lisle. He returned to
England, if poss ble, a greater boor than he had been
when he left his native shores. His dress, which had

Lady Lisle.
been before his marriage generally chosen for him by
the Major, was now in the most execrable taste. He
had picked up a coat here, a hat there, a gaudy waist-
coat in one city, a pair of jingling spurs, a coloured
cravat, and an embroidered smoking-cap in another.
Parisian jewellery hung about his waistcoat and glittered
in his shirt-front. The Rue de la Paix and the Palais
Royal had been ransacked to find him emeralds and
rubies, opals and turquoises, amethysts and sapphires.
The fingers of his clumsily-shaped hands were loaded
with rings. His watch-chain was heavy with the useless
ornaments hanging to it. “I'll show them that I could
buy up the best of 'em," he said sometimes, when he
imagined himself not sufficiently admired or respected
by the natives of some city through which he passed.
He abused and swore at the innkeepers in shrill tor-
rents of his native Saxon; and then swore at them
again because they could not understand him. He
blundered and vociferated, declaring that he'd make
himself understood, or he he'd know the reason why.
He abused the thin German wines; but drank so freely
of those vintages that he spent the greater part of his
honeymoon in a state of semi-intoxication. He yawned
before the pictures and talked aloud in the cathedrals.
He openly showed his contempt for the quiet wor-
shippers kneeling at time-honoured shrines, and jingled
his guilt spurs in the holiest recesses of the sacred fanes
through which he scampered. Even the courier shrugged
his shoulders, and abandoned his master to his fate.
“For Madame I will do all my possible," this indivi-
dual would say to his intimates; “but for M's'ieu- "
He would firish his sentence with a series of shrugs and
muttered imprecations, and saunter off to the travelling-
carriage, leaving the Baronet to dispute a bill or abuse
a waiter, as that gentleman's fancy dictated. “I wash
me my hands of him,” he muttered ; "he is too much
English."
For we labour abroad under this disadvantage, that
whenever any particularly objectionable person makes

his appearance in a foreign country, he is immediately
accepted as a perfect specimen of our British metal;
while a more polished Englishman is complimented by
being told that he has evidently travelled a great deal,
and has improved himself by the example of his neigh-
bours.
And how did Olivia—who had never in her life been
too much given to conceal her feelings-how did she
endure the boorish manners of her travelling com-
panion ? Did it pain her, when the man whom she
had sworn to love, honour, and obey, made himself so
obnoxious that the most courteous and well-paid of inn-
keepers did not attempt to conceal the disgust occasioned
by his conduct ? Did she blush for his meannesses or
endeavour to remodel his character? No. She sat by
his side, with a face which might have been hewn out of
marble for any power it had of betraying her emotions.
Had he been some obnoxious dog, who annoyed the
people amongst whom she went, she could scarcely have
been so indifferent, for she might then have felt herself
called upon to apologize for his misconduct. Do what
he would, she never evinced either surprise or dis-
pleasure. So complete was her disdain, that it seemed
as if she did not or could not either see or hear him.
If he tried to oppose her in her dearest wishes, she did
not complain of his rudeness or dispute his opinions,
but she coldly took her own way. Overbearing as he
was to other people, his obstinacy rarely held out against
her iron will. She dragged him after her through
picture galleries till his eyes ached and his knees
grew weak beneath him; for while Olivia’s constitution
was superb, the Baronet's health was sickly and his
frame feeble. Everywhere Lady Lisle was admired and
courted; and Sir Rupert, who took pleasure from very
little in the course of his travels, was gratified by
beholding the sensation made by his wife.
“Let her spend my money," he said. “Fling it
away, Livy, if you like. There's plenty more at my
banker's. Show those foreign impostors that the wife

of a rich English Baronet is worth six of their royal
duchesses, who live upon four or five hundred a year,
and eat nothing but saur craut."
But the bridal tour was over, and Lady Lisle had re-
turned to the splendid mansion in which she was hence-
forth to reign supreme. Claribel, who had been so long
sole mistress of Lislewood Park, had made her arrange-
ments for leaving immediately upon the arrival of the
young couple. Lady Lisle met her mother-in-law in the
hall on the morning after her return. Mrs. Walsingham
was dressed in travelling costume, and was followed by
her maid.
“Why, what is this?” cried Olivia. “Whose are all
these portmanteaus ?” she asked. “Mrs. Walsingham,
you are not going to leave us ?”
“I was this moment coming into the library to
bid you good-bye, Lady Lisle,” said Claribel coldly.
“I have only been a visitor in my son's house during
your honeymoon trip, and I am now going to Brighton,
where I have taken apartments. Sir Rupert told me
very plainly that our homes must henceforth be separate;
though he need scarcely have troubled himself to sug-
gest an arrangement which I had myself concluded
upon even before he spoke.”
The impetuous girl, whose looks evinced the greatest
possible surprise, caught hold of Mrs. Walsingham's
hand and led her into the library.
“Now, Mrs. Walsingham," she said, placing the
elder lady in a chair by the oriel window, “ tell me what
is the meaning of all this? Sir Rupert has insulted
you— O, as to that,” she said, as if in reply to a
gesture of Claribel's, “it would scarcely be so unlike
him even to insult his mother.” Mrs. Walsingham
leaned her head upon her hand, concealing her face from
Olivia. “My dear Mrs. Walsingham,” said Lady Lisle, “I
know, I know that I, of all others, have the least right to
speak to you like this. Whatever your elder son may be,
it is not for me to utter a word against him. I never have
done so, and I never will. I am not very particular

in what I say to him, but I will never speak ill of him
to others. And now, my dear Mrs. Walsingham, let
me implore you not to leave this house because I have
come into it. I am not a very amiable girl, I know;
but I do not think I should ever have it in my heart to
offend you. If you can take pity upon a woman who
has never known womanly love-take pity upon mne.
My sisters have never had one spark of true affection for
me. They envy me my brilliant fortune. Heaven help
me! Take pity upon me, then, and love me, love me, if
you can! Let me call you mother, for the sake of that
mother whom I never knew.” And the admired and
fascinating Lady Lisle let her head fall upon Claribel's
shoulder and burst into a passion of sobs.
This brief interview had a lasting effect upon the
intercourse of the two women. Mrs. Walsingham
stopped at Lislewood, refusing to remain beneath the
roof of the Baronet, but only removing to the village,
where she repurchased the house and grounds which
had belonged years before to her maiden aunt Miss
Merton, and which Claribel had left upon her marriage
with Sir Reginald Lisle.
Lady Lisle soon convinced the neighbouring families
that she was not going to spare her husband's purse.
She filled the great house with company, till there was
not a garret in the roof untenanted by valets and ladies'
maids, who grumbled and groaned at the lack of ac-
commodation. She surrounded herself with noise and
gaiety; she gave fêtes champêtres in the park, and en-
gaged Tyrolese glee-singers arů Hungarian minstrels
and fashionable performers of all kinds for the amuse-
ment of her guests, and she gave dancing parties and
luncheon parties, and lighted the long avenues with
myriads of coloured lamps in the dusk of the summer's
evenings. She superintended in person the building of
a range of new stables, with wonderful thatched roofs,
and filled them with hunters, to be ready for the coming
season. She built a riding-school at the back of the
house, in which she rode half the morning, flying over

leaping-bars, and executing all kinds of alarming eques-
trian manoeuvres. A tennis-court, which had long been
disused, was put into repair by her orders, and the balls
were flying about half the day amongst a group of noisy
players, with her ladyship very often at their head.
Amidst all this tumult and gaiety Sir Rupert was the
merest cipher. He wrote cheques at his wife's direc-
tion,—for one flash of her great black eyes silenced any
objection he felt inclined to make as to the amount
which she demanded of him. But the influence by
which she ruled him now was fear and not love. All
that mad and impatient love with which he had urged
on the marriage was gone for ever. She was his ! To
his coarse and low nature all was said in this. However
she might rule him, she was, after all, only a part of his
wealth—as much his to dispose of as his horses or his
dogs. If he feared her, he also feared them; but they
were his own, bought with his own money–his own to
do what he liked with; and so was she.
The summer passed in one perpetual round of gaiety,
in which the master of the house seemed so out of place,
that he might have been mistaken for one of his own
stable-boys. Major Varney, who, with his wife and valet,
had been absent on a visit during the summer, returned
late in the autumn to take up his abode at Lislewood
Park. The Indian officer knew very well how to make
himself agreeable to the mistress of the house, and Olivia,
who never consulted her husband about anything, was
often very glad to avail herself of Granville Varney's
advice. So summer, autumn, and early winter wore
away, and the first year of Lady Lisle's married life
drew towards its close, when an event occurred which
led to the first violent dispute between the lady and her
husband.
Olivia was returning to the park in the dusk of a
November evening from a long ride on the downs, when
her attention wss arrested by the appearance of a woman
who sat on a low bench just inside the gates, and exactly
opposite the lodge once occupied by Gilbert Arnold and

203
his wife. The woman was pale and thin. She was very
poorly dressed, and her little bundle lay upon the bench
by her side. She looked up as the lodge-keeper opened
the gates to admit Olivia, and something in her face,
some look of timid supplication and piteous appeal,
touched Lady Lisle's heart, for she stopped her horse
and spoke to the woman.
“What is it, my good woman?” she asked. “Do
you want anything of me?” The Baronet's wife had
many pensioners, and she dealt out, her charities with
spirit and discrimination. Falsehood and imposture
quailed under the straightforward questionings of Olivia
Lisle. She looked searchingly at the strange woman,
who had risen from the bench to answer her, and saw
nothing in the wan and careworn face to awaken her
suspicions. “What is it you want of me, my good
woman ? ” she repeated. She never countenanced any
beating about the bush in the method of her pensioners'
requests. Whatever they wanted of her they were told
to ask for in plain English.
“Ma'am-my lady,” said the woman, hesitating, as
she met the steady gaze of the beautiful black eyes
looking down at her, " for you are Lady Lisle, are you
not, my lady? You are his wife ?”
“The wife of Sir Rupert Lisle. Yes. What is all
this about ? ” asked Olivia rather sharply.
“O, my lady, then, as you are kind and pitiful, do
befriend me by letting me see him. Let me see him
Sir Rupert, I mean. I don't ask any more.”
“But you've heard once for all that Sir Rupert won't
see you, haven't you ?” said the lodge-keeper, who had
come out to listen to this dialogue ; " which she did,
my lady. She's been here worriting ever since two
o'clock this day, “Could she go up to the house to see
Sir Rupert ? 'which I told her no. “Could she wait
till Sir Rupert came out, and see him then?' which I
told her that very likely Sir Rupert warn't a-comin' out,
as the cold weather didn't agree with his poor chest.
• Then might she send him a scrap of paper—just a

scrap of a old envelope, with her name wrote on it in
pencil ?' and she worrited, and cried, and went on so,
that at last I gave way to her whims, and I sent my
eldest boy up to the house with the scrap of paper as
she'd wrote her name on. When, what was the conse-
quence? Why, my boy comes back and says as how
the footman told him as it was like his imperdence to
carry such messages ; for when Sir Rupert laid his eyes
upon the paper, he burst out a-swearin' and cussin', and
said if he see that name again, or was any way bothered
by such rubbish, those as bothered him should make
acquaintance with the inside of Lewes gaol."
“He did, he did !” cried the woman, sitting down
upon the bench and rocking herself backwards and
forwards in an agony of grief. “He did ; he said those
bitter cruel words—he did !”
Lady Lisle sprang from her horse and flung the reins
to her groom.“ Take him to the stables, Lewis," she
said; “I shall walk to the house with this woman.”
“It's too bad as Sir Rupert should be worrited by
every tramp in the county,” said the lodge-keeper; "with
his delicate health too, poor dear gentleman!”
“Hold your tongue, will you !” cried Olivia. “Now,
my good woman,” she added, “come with me to the
house, and on the way there you can tell me what all
this means."
The woman followed Lady Lisle, with whose rapid
footsteps she had some difficulty in keeping pace. As
soon as they were out of hearing of the lodge-keeper,
Olivia began to question her petitioner.
“Now, then, my good woman,” she said, “tell me
who you are and what you want with Sir Rupert
Lisle."
“You may have heard my name, my lady," she an-
swered, at length. “I knew Sir Rupert when he was a
boy, and did my best, God knows, in my poor way, to
rear him well and treat him kindly; but there was others
in the way as came between me and him, and he not
taking to me, or caring for me, as he might have done”

(her tears broke out afresh as she said these words), “I
couldn't keep him out of all harm, try how I could. But
I never could have thought that he would serve me like
this! I never, never, never could have thought it !”
“But, good heavens !” cried Lady Lisle, whose small
stock of patience was nearly exhausted by the woman's
tears and lamentations/" for mercy's sake, tell me who
you are, and how you came to have anything to do with
my husband ?”
"I am the wife of that Gilbert Arnold, my lady, the
lodge-keeper of whom you may have heard.”
"I have heard the whole story,” said Olivia steruly,
s and a very bad story it is—a wicked and a shameful
plot, and I think your husband was very lucky to get
off as he did, without being made to pay dearly for his
villany."
“Heaven knows I had no hand in that bad plot, my
lady,” said the woman. “Heaven knows how sorry I
am that ever it was thought of. It was a bad and cruel
plot, that can never bring anything but misery to those
that had a hand in it-misery to the villain that planned
it and misery to me, that am as innocent of it as the
babe unborn."
“Is this true ? " asked Lady Lisle.
“As true as there is light in heaven, my lady. If I
wasn't innocent, and if your husband did not know that
I was innocent, should I come here to ask for help from
him?"
“I think I may venture to believe you," said Olivia ,
“ but now tell me what brought you here? I under-
stood that you and your husband sailed for America
more than a year ago.”
"We did, my lady; and he is there now, as I think.
He never treated me kind at the best of times, and when
we landed at New York he used me more cruel than he
had ever done before. We hadn't been there long when
he left me, on the pretence of going many miles to choose
a piece of land to build a house on, and he took the best
part of the money and almost everything we had with

him, leaving me but a few pounds, to live, as he said,
till he came back. He never came back, my lady, and
from that day to this I have never heard a word of him.
Some kind people in New York came to know my story,
and got me a place as servant, and very good wages-
and I pinched and scraped to save the money to pay my
passage home; for I thought that if I could but get back
here, Sir Rupert would surely give me enough to end
my days in peace and quiet. I am not old," she added ;
“Miss Claribel Merton (Mrs. Walsingham that is) and I
were just of an age; but I feel like an old woman, for I
have suffered so much. And to think that he should
treat me so; to think that he should treat me so !” she
cried, half to herself.
They had reached the house by this time. Lady Lisle
ran up the steps.
“Come this way with me,” she said to Rachel Arnold,
and hurrying across the hall, she turned into a passage
that led straight into the billiard-room, followed by the
poacher's wife.
Sir Rupert Lisle was at the other end of the room.
He was stooping over the table to take a ball out of one
of the pockets, and did not perceive his wife's entrance.
The room was full of gentlemen, amongst whom was
Major Varney, who, with his usual good nature, was
officiating as marker.
" Then I score another twenty for you, my Rupert,"
he said. “What an accomplished player the boy is
becoming!”
“I don't want any of your chaff,” replied the Baronet,
his head still stooping over the table. “If I play bad,
other people play bad besides me. I don't see that
you're any of you such an over-bright lot.”
“Sir Rupert Lisle !” exclaimed Olivia, her clear voice
ringing through the room, as she pronounced her hus-
band's name.
The Baronet raised his head and looked at his wife.
He only looked at her for a moment though, for in the
next instant his eye had caught the sickly pale face of

the woman standing a little way behind Olivia, and he
grew as white as a corpse.
“What do you bring beggar women into my house
for, Lady Lisle ?” he shouted with an oath. “Is a man
of my station and my wealth to be tormented by every
tramp who chooses to ask him for money ? How dare
you bring beggars into this room, Olivia! How dare you!
I've borne enough of your mad pranks and spent money
enough on your vagaries; but I won't bear this! Curse
me if I'll bear this.” His face changed from pale to
scarlet, and the perspiration broke out in great beads
upon his forehead. “Am I never to have any peace ?"
he roared. “Am I never to be let alone? It isn't one,
nor two, nor four, that think they've got the right to
follow me up and extort money out of me, but it will
be twenty before it's all done. Money here and money
there! What's the fortune to me, if I am not to keep
a penny of it? What's this fine house to me, if I'm
never to sleep in peace in it? What do they want of
me now?”
Rachel Arnold ran to him, and, falling on her knees
at his feet, caught one of his hands in both of hers and
kissed it passionately,
“Only a little pity, dear,” she said, as the young man
tried to snatch his hand from her; "only a little mercy,
dear. For the sake of the love I bore you when you
were a child, have pity upon me, have pity upon
your- "
The poor creature, still kneeling on the ground and
clinging to his hand, lifted up her face in supplication
as she spoke. In a mad fury the Baronet, with his dis-
engaged fist, struck the wretched woman full in the
face; so violently, that the blood trickled fast from a
cut across her upper lip. Rachel Arnold fell to the
ground with a stifled shriek.
Lady Lisle, with one dark scornful glance at the
Baronet, rushed to assist the unhappy creature. The
spectators looked at one another, and a loud murmur
of indignation ran round the room. Major Varney had

deserted his occupation as marker and had drawn near
the Baronet during this scene, and, at the moment when
the woman fell to the ground, he caught Sir Rupert Lisle
by the collar of his coat and flung him violently against
the wall of the room.
“You ruffian!” he cried, “you mean pitiful hound !
you contemptible villain! without one redeeming touch
of common humanity! I swear to you that, if I had
known what you really are, you might have rotted
piecemeal in the garret where I found you before I
would have soiled my hands by lifting a finger of them
to help you. I don't believe in all Newgate there is a
wretch who would have done what you did just this
moment. Dog! I loathe and detest you! and hate
myself for being mixed up with you!”
No one had ever until now seen Major Varney out of
temper. Tall and powerful, he seemed like a modern
Hercules as he towered above the cowering figure of
the Baronet, who was pinioned to the wall, and who
looked as if he would have gladly shrunk into that very
wall to hide himself from the indignant eyes that were
concentrated upon him.
“I didn't mean to hurt her,” gasped the Baronet,
livid and trembling. “Why did she aggravate me so ?
What do I want with tramps hugging and kissing me,
and making me look like a fool before my own visitors
in my own house? Why the devil did Olivia bring her
here? She must have done it on purpose to torment
me. If she wants a five-pound note, or a ten, or a
twenty-pound note, I'll give it her. But let her take
herself off. She's not wanted here, and she shan't stay
here. Curse her white face "
“She shall stay here as long as she pleases,” said
Major Varney. “She shall stay here to bear witness
against you for a black-hearted scoundrel. She will
carry the mark of this day's work to her dying day.
I'm not over soft-hearted, as you know," added the
Major; “but I can remember my mother, for I loved
her before the world had taught me to take care of

jnyself, and I'll never see a woman struck; least of all
will I see that woman struck by you."
“But you do not know all, Major Varney,” said Lady
Lisle, who, with the help of the bystanders, had raised
Rachel Arnold into a chair; "you do not know, per-
haps, that this woman is utterly innocent of the plot
against Sir Rupert Lisle's fortune, and that she was his
good and kind friend at a time that he had very few
friends. We have seen how bravely he has repaid her
devotion.”
“Hold your tongue, will you!” cried Sir Rupert
savagely.
The Major had released him by this time, and he was
awkwardly trying to twist his neckcloth into shape,
looking about him, as he did so, with a defiant scowl.
“I wish you'd keep your finger out of the pie, Olivia
Lisle,” he said. “You are a good one to talk about
devotion! You know such a lot about it. You've
shown such devotion to me; haven't you! Yes,
devotion to a good long purse; that's the only kind of
devotion I've ever had from you."
The Baronet's wife drew herself to her fullest height
and swept past him without a word ; but at the door
she turned round and addressed her husband before the
whole assembly.
“ To my dying day I will never forgive you for your
conduct of this afternoon, Sir Rupert Lisle, any more
than I will forgive myself for having been so base &
wretch as to marry you.”
She was gone before he could attempt to reply. As
the door closed upon her, and as his visitors, one by one,
dropped away from him and left the room, the master
of Lislewood threw himself into a chair and began to
cry and whimper like a peevish child.
“How hard it is,” he whined, “how hard it is! I
wish I was dead! I wish I was a dog! I wish I was
anywhere out of this! If I was only out of this !”
Olivia sent the housekeeper to take charge of Rachel
Arnold. The unhappy woman was conducted to a

comfortable room on the upper story, where one of the
house-maids assisted her to undress, and watched by
her bedside till the doctor came to dress the wound
upon her mouth.
The dinner that day was a very dreary one. Olivia
was absent. She had gone straight to her father's
house after the scene in the billiard-room, and she did
not return to the Park that evening. The Baronet
dined in his own room, and Major Varney officiated
in his stead. But though he did his best to talk
and laugh away the impression of the unpleasant
domestic drama which had been enacted in the billiard-
room, he could not succeed in doing so, and a cloud
hung over the spirits of every one present. It is not
a pleasant thing to eat the best of dinners or drink
the rarest of wines at the expense of a host whom you
despise; and there was not a guest at Sir Rupert's
table who would not sooner have shared a slice of fat
bacon with any honest chawbacon in all Sussex, than
have broken bread with the master of Lislewood Park.
“I call the exposure of to-day a very awful thing,
sir,” whispered an elderly man to his neighbour at the
dinner-table; “for I take it as a sign of the deterio-
ration in the blood of our great county families. The
Lisles, sir, have been accounted the noblest gentlemen
in Sussex for upwards of six hundred years, and I can
assure you the conduct of that young man to-day was
& severe blow to my feelings.”
CHAPTER XXVI.
AT BELMINSTER.
WALTER REMORDEN found plenty to do in the town
of Belminster. Although the fly-blown fashion-plate
in the window of Miss Fagg, the milliner of High-
street, was a year and a half old to the outer world
before it appeared as a novelty in Belminster; although
there were a hundred different ways in which the little

At Belminster.
211
Yorkshire town was a century behind larger and busier
cities, there were some things in the cultivation of
which it was on a level with the gayest watering-place,
or the most crowded manufacturing town in England.
Alas! that I should have to write it, those things in
which Belminster was not behind-hand, were the crimes
and vices that cast their hideous shadows often in the
fairest places. Belminster for wickedness was quite
in advance of the age,–or, shall I not rather say,
it was sadly and cruelly behind the age, by reason of
its isolation, which kept it in the darkness, while new
lights were shining in upon the obscurity of places
more frequented and better known ? The Belminster
people had been left to work their own wickedness
their own way. The dismal streets that were so quiet
in the day were noisy at night with rioting and de-
bauchery. The late rector of St. Clement's, Belminster,
had been a lazy old man, who had been wont to make
personal allusions to the members of his congregation
in his sermons, sometimes addressing them by name,
and always making them laugh. But as he had given
away a great deal of good old wine and strong soup,
with flannel, coals, and beef, at Christmas, he had been
universally beloved, and followed to the grave by the
Belminster populace, who lamented him with weeping
and moaning; and afterwards got up a drunken fight
in the market-place to finish the evening.
The new rector was quite a different man. He was
the son of a small farmer, and he had begun life upon
a curacy of fifty-five pounds a year in a fenny village
in Lincolnshire, and had slowly worked his way into
the good estimation of the Archbishop of York by
such acts of self-denial and devoted exertion as had
made his name known and loved and feared wherever
he had set his foot in the course of his wanderings.
This was the man for Belminster. The thunder of his
voice shook the lofty roof of St. Clement's Church.
He reprobated the vices of the people; but he took care
to show them how they might amend. He was not

afraid of sin; he never shuddered at its aspect; but he
hunted it down, and hand to hand with it struggled
and conquered. He did not cross to the other side of
the way if a wretched woman crept by him; but he
would grasp her by her fluttering shawl as she brushed
by his side, and would ask her then and there why she
was thus, and if she meant always to continue thus with-
out hope or effort for amendment? He always abased
himself to the level of the people to whom he spoke;
not ostentatiously, not by a figure of speech, as false as
it was shallow, but positively and practically; and he
would not be contented till he made his hearer see and
feel the parallel.
“You are a working man, and I am a working man,”
he would say to some idle drunken bricklayer. “ You
neglect your work, and here you are worrying the parish
for relief, when you ought to be earning thirty shillings
a week. You were idle, I suppose, and got drunk, and
so were dismissed by your master. Do you think it
would be no pleasure to me to drink a bottle of old
port and loll at home all day reading the newspaper ?
Of course it would; but I mustn't do it! and, what's
more, you mustn't do it! or, if you do, you must take
the consequences, which, I tell you pretty plainly, will
be starvation."
Nine times out of ten this reasoning was entirely
successful. The man would pick himself up, lounge
away from the public-house, and go and get work, if
it was to be had, which it generally is, if people will
only look for it.
Mr. Hayward never tried to beguile grown men and
women with pretty lollipop sayings that nobody ever
yet believed in. He did not tell wretched creatures,
lying in stifling hovels, to which the pure wir never
penetrated, that it was a pleasant thing to be poor and
comfortless, and that if they were only good they would
be sure to be happy. No; he told them that they must
not be contented with dirt and filth, but that they must
cover over drains and break open blocked-up windows,

213
and scrub, scour, whitewash, and purify; and then, and
not till then, they might sit down and be contented. In
all these wholesome works the rector would substantially
assist the helpless thziftless sinners. And when all was
done, and the house was cleansed, and the eldest girl
rescued from the wretched streets, and sent away to a
reformatory established by the rector and the charitable
inhabitants of Belminster, a few miles out of the town;
when the eldest boy had been cured of playing pitch-
and-toss at street corners, and sent into a foundry to earn
five shillings a week; when the little ones were in the
National School, and the father had succeeded in getting
a job at his own trade; then the rector set to work to
teach these people how to be good Christians and sin.
cere believers; and then, and not till then, he found
them apt pupils.
But Mr. Hayward did not win his way into the hearts
of his parishioners without a hard fight for it. At first
Belminster hated and defied him; then it began to fear
him; and it ultimately ended by only loving him-
loving him as children may love a good but severe
father; and this was the aspect of affairs when the
rector secured an excellent coadjutor in the person of
Walter Remorden.
In many ways the curate very much resembled the
rector. Like the rector, he was earnest and zealous.
Like Mr. Hayward, he was not given to coaxing people
to be good as you coax children with sugar-plums. He
howed them rather, that though goodness was a hard
thing, and sometimes even an unprofitable thing, still it
was, after all, the best and wisest thing for them, and
that the sugar-plums very often came of themselves
when least looked for. He was never weary of his
work. He shunned all society except that of the rector,
and he spent his days in going from house to house-
not afraid of hard words or black looks, or foul and
fever-tainted air, but setting up his standard on every
hearthstone and biding his time. A fair harvest soon
began to fall in from all this good seed that had been

inhabitants bied become an Walter
sown; and the old inhabitants of the town declared
with one accord that Belminster had become an altered
place since the advent of James Hayward and Walter
Remorden.
The rector had only one child, a daughter, a girl of
about nineteen years of age, of whom he was dotingly
fond. Nor was his affection unrequited, for Blanche
Hayward loved her father as it is rarely the lot of fathers
to be loved in this world. Mrs. Hayward was a lady-
like nonentity, who spent her days in working elaborate
fancy-work, and who was never tired of lifting her pale
eyebrows and exclaiming against the depravity of Bel-
minster. The management of the house, the giving
out of alms, the cutting and contriving of garments
for the poor, all devolved upon Blanche, who was her
father's confidante and adviser, and who aided him in
all his schemes. The father and daughter would stroll
together in the cool summer evenings through the
rectory gardens, Mr. Hayward leaning one hand on
Blanche's shoulder and describing to her the adven-
tures of the day; while his wife looked at them from
the drawing-room window, wondering, as she said, how
they could always find so much to talk about. But the
rector's daughter was no ordinary girl. She had been
educated by her father, and would have been stigmatized
by ordinary people as a blue-stocking, for she was a
good classical scholar, spoke half a dozen modern lan-
guages, was well read in history, and could write a good
lecture or an excellent sermon.
The young ladies of Belminster opened their eyes
very wide when Miss Hayward told them, without so
much as a blush, that she did not know one note from
another on the piano, and that she could not draw so
much as a leaf, or a flower, a ruined castle, or a rustic
windmill. She was not what is generally called a pretty
girl. Her features were irregular, her complexion pale;
but her countenance had a brightness and an ever-
varying vivacity which would have redeemed the ugliest
face that ever nature was guilty of sending into the

215
world, and she had a wealth of dark chestnut hair,
which fell about her head in natural curls, and defied
any attempt to arrange it. She dressed in the plainest
manner; for, as she devoted her time to visiting the
cottages of the poor, she had very little need of fine
clothes. She had gone to a county ball once, in a plain
black silk dress, with a low neck and short sleeves, and
without so much-the outraged Belminster ladies re-
marked—as a flower in her hair. But as this luxuriant
curling hair tumbled about her head and on to her
sloping shoulders, and as the black dress showed off
those plump shoulders and a pair of very white arms,
Miss Blanche Hayward had looked by no means the
least attractive person in the ball-room. And she had
talked-I am afraid to say how much she had talked-
to her partners and to old gentlemen lounging against
the walls, and to the girls and to the dowagers, and
once very nearly to a waiter, whom she recognized as
a reformed drunkard, and a protégé of her father's.
But for all this everybody liked her. The young men
said she was a “sensible party," while the old fogies
declared her to be a well-informed young woman; and
she went home, after a night of the most unalloyed
enjoyment, to get up at six o'clock the next morning,
dress by candlelight, and go and teach her own peculiar
class in the National School.
Blanche Hayward and Walter Remorden were soon
excellent friends. She was delighted with the new
curate, though she could not understand the rooted
melancholy which revealed itself to those who were at
all interested in his character. She saw that he flew
to duty as to a distraction, loving it, if possible, more
for that than purely for its own sake, as she and her
father loved it; simply because it must be done, and
because it was good to do it.
“Mr. Remorden has something upon his mind, papa,".
she said one morning, looking up from her work as
she sat opposite to her father. “Do you know what
it is ?"

Lady Lislo.
"Not I, Blanche. What can he have on his mind ?
His family are very well off ; his income here is a good
one; he can have no poverty to contend with ; his
health is good "
“ Pretty good, papa,” interrupted Blanche; “not so
very good. You know he had only just recovered from
a severe illness when he came to Belminster."
“ You know all about it, it seems, Miss Blanche," said
her father, laughing.
“He told me so, you know, papa," she answered
promptly. “I like him very much, for I think him all
that is good, and I don't like to see him unhappy-for,
say what you will, I know that he is unhappy."
"I suppose he told you that too,” said the rector.
“No, indeed, papa. He always seems to be trying
to appear cheerful; but you can see the effort is painful
to him.”
“You can see ? I can see nothing of the kind. You
foolish Blanche," answered her father, “ do you suppose
I ever trouble myself to study the sighings and moanings
of Mr. Walter Remorden? I only know that he is the
best curate I ever had ; that he appears to do his work
with his whole heart, and that he does it well.”
“I shouldn't at all wonder, papa, if he had been dis-
appointed in love."
I don't know how it was, but Blanche, who was by no
means given to betraying any foolish or young-lady-like
emotions, blushed crimson after having made this obser-
vation, and stooping over her work, began to exercise her
needle with unusual rapidity. The rector did not per-
ceive this blush; he was busy writing letters, and had
never once looked up during the brief dialogue. The
conversation dropped at this point, and Blanche did
not say any more about Walter Remorden that morn.

her almost as he might have done on some old college
friend. There was so much that was masculine in the
powerful intellect of the rector's daughter, that she
served him instead of a friend of his own sex. There
was nothing he wished to talk of that he could not talk
of to her—politics, divinity, political economy, litera-
ture, metaphysics; in all these subjects she was, if not
his equal, at least a most delightful neophyte; frank, un-
affected, unpretending, always quick to learn and eager
to be instructed. But much as they were together,
nothing like a flirtation ever arose between these two.
Coquetry was an accomplishment utterly unknown to
the rector's daughter. No one ever flattered Blanche
Hayward. A stereotyped compliment would have
seemed an insult to her clear common sense. She had
few admirers; for most men were a little afraid of her,
though they esteemed and respected her goodness and
abilities.
One evening in the December of the first year after
his arrival at Belminster, Walter Remorden sat in the
rectory drawing-room, talking to Blanche and her mother
-talking, at least, to Blanche, for Mrs. Hayward soon
dropped out of the conversation, saying that they were
so clever, and that they really made her feel quite silly,
wbich (had she had any clear perception of her own state)
she might easily have done. The rector had retired to
his little study after dinner to examine some accounts
connected with his new National Schools, and Blanche
and the curate had the evening to themselves. This was
when Blanche was truly happy. With a heap of new
books lying ready for discussion upon the table before
her; with Mr. Remorden in his most brilliant and con-
versational mood; with her mamma quietly seated at
her own little work-table, dozing over the perpetual
embroidery; and with, above all, the consciousness of
having done such a day's work as would have astonished
any young lady in Yorkshire, Blanche was in her seventh
heaven. But on this particular evening she was not
destined to enjoy the curate's society long without inter-

ruption; her father came in to tea, and he had a great
deal to say about a visitor he had just received in his
study.
“I scarcely know what to advise, Blanche,” he said ;
" but you and Remorden have such a very clever way
of hitting upon capital schemes for the benefit of other
people, that perhaps you can tell me what I ought to
say to Mr. Daunton, the master of the principal boys'
school in this place, who has been consulting me about
a difficulty he is in.”
“And what is the difficulty, papa ?” asked Blanche.
“Why, my dear,” said her father, “Mr. Daunton has
for some years had amongst his pupils a lad of the name
of Saunders, who was brought to him twelve years and
a half ago, and who, when he came, was about ten years
old. He is, therefore, now upwards of twenty-two; quite
a young man, of course, and old enough to be out in
the world, instead of being mewed up in Mr. Daunton'e
back parlour. But that is not the difficulty, and I want
to come to that first. Now it appears that the boy was
brought to Daunton by his uncle, a person of the name
of Saunders, who stated that he was a clergyman of the
Church of England. The boy, he said, was an orphan,
the son of his brother, who had died in the West Indies,
where the boy had been born, and where he had had an
attack of yellow fever, so severe that it had for the time
deprived him of his reason, and had afterwards so much
affected his memory that he was quite unable to recall
any of the events of his childhood. Mr. Saunders
brought his nephew to Belminster, therefore, he said,
in order that, if possible, care, attention, and country
air might restore him to perfect health. For eleven
years the money for the boy's schooling has been paid
regularly, Mr. Saunders coming to Belminster once a
year to settle his account and to look at his nephew;
but for the last year and a half Daunton has not re-
ceived a farthing, nor can be obtain any tidings of
Mr. Saunders.”
“What, has he not his address, then ?" asked Walter.

At Belminster.
219
“No. Mr. Saunders told Daunton always to direct
to him under cover to a lawyer in Gray's Inn Square.
He has written, of course, to that gentleman; but can
hear nothing, except that, to the best of the solicitor's
belief, Mr. Saunders has gone to the East Indies; but
what part of India he has gone to, or when he is likely
to return to England, the solicitor does not know.”
“But the 'Clergy List'— "
"O, as to that,” said the rector, “there are several
Saunderses in the Church; but Daunton has written to
them all, and has received answers denying any know-
ledge of the affair from every one of them.”
"And the young man himself, what does he say to
all this?” Blanche asked.
“Nothing whatever that can throw any light upon
the subject. He remembers nothing of his childhood,
except being at the seaside with his uncle George, as
he calls Mr. Saunders, after a very dangerous illness.
He fancies that he was at the seaside for two or three
years; but he cannot remember the name of the place,
or the people with whom he stopped.”.
“And can he remember nothing that occurred before
his illness ?”
“No. He can never be induced to speak of that
period, and has a strange dislike to be questioned upon
the subject. His temperament is peculiarly nervous,
and his health delicate."
“But is his intellect in any way impaired ?” asked
Walter Remorden.
“Not in the least. Indeed, Daunton says that the
young man is very clever.”
“Papa !” cried Blanche suddenly, “ I have an idea.”
“Of course, my darling," said her father, “I knew
you'd get us out of our difficulty."
“You know, papa, that as soon as your new National
Schools are built, you'll want a schoolmaster for the
boys. Now, I know you prefer having a young man
in the situation, as you do not like to have to combat
with settled prejudices and antiquated ideas. Why not ·

employ this poor abandoned boy? You might mould

master of him.”
“So I might, Blanche. It shall be done. If the
young man is in any way eligible for the situation he
shall have it."
Though the grass might flourish in the square before
the minster, it never was allowed to grow under the
feet of the rector of St. Clement's. So, early the next
morning, Mr. Hayward, being particularly engaged
himself, sent his curate to call upon Mr. Daunton, the
schoolmaster, and to make acquaintance with Richard
Saunders.
“ Mind, I leave all in your hands," the rector said to
Walter. “You will see in five minutes whether the
young man will suit us. If not, we must think of some-
thing else for him.”
The curate found Richard Saunders seated in Mr.
Daunton's breakfast-parlour, reading. The worthy
schoolmaster had made no change in his treatment
of his pupil since the annual remuneration had ceased
to be paid. Indeed, he was sincerely attached to
the young man, and very anxious for his welfare in
life.
“For it is a sad thing," he whispered to the curate,
as he led him into the little sitting-room," it is a very
sad thing to see a delicate sensitive lad cast upon the
world, without a friend to help him, and without health
or strength to help himself.”
Walter Remorden was very favourably impressed by
the appearance of the young man. There was some-
thing peculiarly delicate in the pale face and long fair
hair brushed away from the high forehead.
“This is Mr. Remorden, Richard," said the school.
master, “whose sermons you have so often admired.”
The young man looked up from his book, rose hur-
riedly, and bowed to Walter, blushing like a girl as he
did so.
“I'll leave you and Richard together," said Mr.

221
Daunton to the curate. “Mr. Remorden would like to
have a little chat with you, my dear boy,” he added to
his pupil.
The curate started several subjects of conversation;
but Richard Saunders only answered in monosyllables,
fidgeting all the time with the leaves of the book he
had in his hands. Walter Remorden noticed those thin
and fragile hands, which were white and slender as the
hands of a woman.
" What is to become of him ?” thought the curate.
“He is as delicate as a girl, and I am afraid he is sadly
deficient in intellect.”
But Walter soon found that he was mistaken. After
a little time the young man warmed into animation ;
he grew fluent, nay, almost eloquent. He talked of a
great many things; never very brilliantly, but always
well. By-and-by the curate felt himself justified in
broaching the subject of the National Schools. He
found the young man delighted with the idea. He
would do anything, he said; he would accept any
situation, however hard, rather than remain a burden
upon the hands of his kind instructor.
*" I owe him so much already," said Richard, “80
much that I can never repay. He has replaced the
friends I have lost. He has cured me of those cruel
delusions "
“What delusions ?” asked Walter Remorden.
“Delusions from which I was still suffering when I
first came to this place. Pray do not ask me anything
about them. I am quite right in mind now, I am
indeed, indeed I am.” He spoke with a feverish energy
and rapidity, but suddenly collecting himself, he became
perfectly tranquil, and said quietly, “And now tell me
about the National School. I think if there is one
position more than another in which I could be useful,
it would be as a tutor. I have seen so much of tuition
here."
The next morning Richard Saunders called by
appointment at the Rectory. Mr. Hayward gave him

a hearty welcome, clapped him on the back with a
strong hand, that seemed to shake the young man's
fragile frame, and handed him over to Blanche.
“She'll tell you all about it, Mr. Saunders," said the
Rector; "she's my secretary, my prime minister, and
my pet and my darling," he added tenderly, as the
young lady shook back her ringlets and held up her
broad white forehead to be kissed.
Richard blushed scarlet on being introduced to Miss
Blanche Hayward. He had seen scarcely any feminine
society, and to be handed over to the tender mercies of
a girl of nineteen filled him with apprehension. How
was he to address her? What was he to say to her?
But Blanche soon set him quite at his ease. She told
him to sit down by her side, and taking out some
papers, began to talk to him about plans and estimates,
and statistics and free schools, till she led him into the
subject, and made him almost forget that he was talking
to that most terrible object in creation, “ a young lady.”
He could not quite forget it either, for he could not
help noticing that Miss Hayward had very handsome
grey eyes and rich masses of chestnut curls, that hung
loosely upon a slim white throat, which looked very
beautiful as it bent over the statistics. He remembered
having observed her in the rectory pew from his seat
in the gallery at St. Clement's, and he remembered
too having fancied even then that she must be a nice
girl.
“And she is a nice girl," he thought, when Blanche
had run away to put on her out-door garments. “How
easy and unaffected she is, and how simple and earnest
in her wish to do good!”
Blanche came back while Richard sat thinking this,
feeling uncomfortably conscious at the same time that
he ought to say something politely commonplace to poor
languid Mrs. Hayward, who was busy with her ever.
lasting fancy-work.
"Now I am going to show you the schools," said
Blanche, as she re-entered the room, with a scarf twisted

223
loosely round her shoulders, and a large straw hat
shading her bright frank face; " and I am going to
show you the house they are building for you ; where
you will live, you know, with an old woman, or a boy,
or somebody of that kind, to wait upon you. I suppose
you can't cook ?”
“ Cook? No, I'm afraid not,” answered Richard,
blushing.
“That's a pity,” replied the practical Blanche; “ it
would have been handier if you could have cooked your
own dinner; I can. But of course you must have a
servant.”
The new schools lay in a little hollow across the
breezy common, half a mile from the town. Blanche
and Richard walked side by side over the rimy grass,
the lady treating her companion with that easy fami-
liarity which girls often assume to a young man of their
own age. Blanche spoke to Richard Saunders with the
calm superiority of a woman who addresses herself to
a boy, and yet he was her senior by three years.
"You have been in Belminster a long time," she
said.
“ Yes, twelve years."
“ And before you came here. "
“Before I came here I was by the seaside, at a quiet
place, not nearly so big as Belminster; a very lonely
quiet place, where there were very few houses, and
where there were high rocks and a wild stormy sea.”
“But, good gracious me!” said Blanche, “you must
remember the name of the place.”
“ No, indeed; I don't think I ever heard it. I know
when we came to Belminster we travelled for a day and
a night, so it must have been very far away from here.
It was a lonely place, and I never saw any one there
but my uncle George, who came sometimes to see me,
and an old woman called Magways, who nursed me."
“Were you ill, then ?"
“Not all the time, but sometimes very ill. I was light
in my head sometimes.”

Lady Lisle.
“But tell me," said Blanche anxiously, "you were
ten years old when you came to Belminster; you were
only two or three years at the seaside ; you must have
been seven or eight years old, therefore, when you went
there first; you must remember something of your life
before that time.”
“No, no, no," cried the young man, with the same
look of terror that Walter Remorden had seen in
his face the day before ; “no, I remember nothing of
that time. My thoughts and fancies about that time
are nothing but delusions; nothing but delusiong-
nothing!”
“But, Mr. Saunders," urged Blanche, her curiosity
more and more excited by the young man's strange
manner, “but these delusions, what are they ?”
"Do not ask me!” he exclaimed. “I have taken
a solemn oath never to speak of them to any human
being.”
“ Ăn oath? But to whom?”
“To my uncle George. He told me that my only
chance of being saved from becoming a madman was to
resolve never to speak of those things again. He said
that my long illness had filled my brain with strange
fancies, and that it rested with myself to effect my own
cure, or to make up my mind to end my days in a lunatic
asylum. He said this to me at that place by the sea-
side, the night before we started for Belminster. I was
only a child ; but I understood every word he said. I
repeated the solemn words of an oath which he dic-
tated, by which I swore never to reveal the fancies that
had taken possession of me."
“And now that you have grown so much older,
do you think that your uncle George was right, and
that these fancies of yours were indeed mere delu-
“I have sworn never to speak of them. Pray do not
question me.”

“My mother! O, for pity's sake, for the sake of
Heaven's own tender mercy, do not speak of her ?”
The young man flung up his arms wildly, covered
his face with his hands, and sobbed aloud.
Blanche walked by his side for some moments in
silence. And then she tried to console him, as it was
her wont to console many sorrowing creatures. But it
seemed as if she had touched some old wound in the
young man's heart. It was some time before he re.
covered himself, some time before he brushed the tears
from his eyes.
“My mother!” he murmured sadly, “ my poor kind
pitiful tender mother! And even she might have been
a dream and a fancy like the rest."
CHAPTER XXVII.
DELIRIUM.
RACHEL ARNOLD was slow to recover from the effects of
the scene in the billiard-room and that triangular gash
upon her upper lip inflicted by the clenched fist of the
Baronet. Fatigue, starvation, excitement, trouble, ill-
usage, all had combined to prostrate the poor feeble
creature; and for many weeks she lay hovering between
life and death in one of the upper rooms at Lislewood
Park. Lady Lisle gave particular orders that the sick
woman should be carefully tended, and that all should
be done to restore her to health ; but for a long time
the doctor gave little hope of her recovery.
" The constitution is feeble, my dear madam," he
said ; " and it is further impaired by a hard life; she
has led a very hard life, this woman, I am convinced. I
remember her years ago, when she and her wretch of
a husband lived at the lodge, and when their little boy,
who, as people said, looked like Sir Rupert's brother,
used to play about at the gates."

“The boy died very young of a fever, I believe," said
Lady Lisle.
“ So I understand, so I understand, my dear Lady
Lisle. He took after his mother, and was rather a
sickly child. I was not surprised to hear of his death.
And now I will go and have a look at my patient. Poor
soul, the constitution is very feeble, and the intellect
not strong—the intellect is by no means strong, and
has been weakened by much suffering, I should
imagine.”
Sir Rupert did not oppose Rachel Arnold's residence
under his roof. Indeed, he seemed rather anxious about
her state of health. He would ask about her every day,
with his own peculiar sullenness of manner, but at the
same time with an evident interest in the answer.
Was she better; was she at all delirious or wander-
ing, eh? No; she was calm, the servants told him.
Quite calm ? Yes, perfectly collected and sensible. And
what did she talk about? Why, as for that, she talked
very little of anything; she was too weak for much
conversation.
These answers appeared to satisfy him; but he would
always ask the same questions the following day, and
with the same air of restraint and hidden interest. Yet,
in spite of his anxiety about Rachel Arnold's health,
nothing that could be said would ever induce Sir Rupert
Lisle to visit the sick woman's apartments. Day after
day she sent him piteous pleading messages--messages
telling him how anxious she was to see him, if only for
a few short minutes; only to look in his face, to hold
his hand in hers, and recall the days when she had
nursed him, a little feeble child, upon her knees; to beg
his forgiveness for having intruded herself upon him in
his time of triumph and prosperity. Such prayers as
these she caused to be conveyed to him continually ;
but she might with as much effect have prayed to
stono !
Sir Rupert found plenty of reasons for refusing to
comply with the invalid's solicitations. He didn't want

227
to be bothering in sick people's rooms, he said. How did
he know that the woman's complaint wasn't infectious?
Most likely it was infectious,-a fever caught on board
ship, perhaps. It would be a nice thing if a baronet,
and the richest man in the county, was to die of a fever
caught of a sick servant. Let her think herself precious
lucky to have dropped into such a good home, and let
that satisfy her. This was all the comfort that Rachel
Arnold ever obtained from Sir Rupert Lisle.
The portly Major, whose light waistcoats grew wider
and wider as the playful fingers of Time passed over his
auburn curls, thinning them a little, but not presuming
to touch them with grey, as they might have touched
the flowing locks of commoner men,--the Major, I say,
was once more in the ascendant at Lislewood Park.
After that scene in the billiard-room, he took up the
sceptre again just as quietly as he had laid it down, and
this time grasped it very firmly. The Baronet returned
to his old place and to his old habits. Perhaps he had
thought that he should secure an ally in his handsome
wife; but Olivia held herself completely aloof from him;
so he had to stand alone, and standing alone, he was no
match for Major Granville Varney. Again he looked
to the Major before he spoke. Again, abject and pale,
with the manner of some guilty hound who has barely
escaped a beating, he followed at the Major's heels,
seeming to live only by his sufferance and direction.
Once he spoke to Major Varney about the sick woman.
“ What can I do?” he said. “ She's always worry.
ing,-sending sickly romantic messages about wanting
to be forgiven, and all such foolery. And what do I
care about seeing her, you know ?” he whined, in his
peevish treble voice.
" Very little, I should think, Sir Rupert,” replied the
Major. “I can see the glitter of that superb sapphire
ring upon your right hand at this moment. I've heard
you say that you gave a hundred end twenty napoleons
for that sapphire in the Rue de la Paix, and it was the
ring that cut Rachel Arnold so severely over the mouth.

Lady Lisle.
No, I should think you would scarcely care about seeing
your-your old servant."
“I'll tell you what," muttered Sir Rupert, “I think
you might keep your tongue between your teeth.
You've made a good thing of it."
“I always meant to make a good thing of it, my
dear Baronet (a baronet of James the First's creation,
remember, dear boy, and a knight centuries before,
the Lisles are such an old family!)-I always meant
to make a good thing of it,” repeated Major Varney,
flinging himself into the velvet depths of a luxurious
sofa. “In the market of life there is no costlier com-
modity than brains. I am but a merchant, and I have
done my best to get a good price for my wares. Per-
haps I have succeeded-perhaps I have succeeded,"
repeated the Major, taking a big silk handkerchief
from one of his pockets and polishing his pink finger-
nails.
“Now, look here,” said Sir Rupert, “I can't have
this woman bothering about me in this way every day
of her life, so I wish you'd just go to her and tell her
that she'd better hold her noise; for she's got a com-
fortable home as it is, and if she don't mind her P's
and Q's, she'll very likely get turned out of it. Do
you understand ?".
“ Perfectly. I'm to go and tell Rachel Arnold all
that ? »
“Every word of it."
" It is not a pleasant message to carry, my Rupert.”
“Never mind that. Pleasant or unpleasant, I suppose
you can carry it. You get enough out of me; so you
may as well make yourself useful in some way or
other."
It pleased the Baronet to assume an air of sulky
defiance in his manner to Major Varney now and then,
though he knew well that it was false ; and knew too
that the Major saw through the shallow disguise.
“As to what I get out of you, or what I may intend
to get out of you in time to come,” said the Major,

looking full at Sir Rupert, “that is of very little
moment. But remember, that I have got that out
of you which makes you as much my slave as if I
had bought you for so many dollars in the Southern
States of America ; as much my dog as if I had paid
a dog-fancier for you, and had you chained and pad-
locked in my kennel. Look at this!”
Major Varney unfastened the lower buttons of his
waistcoat while speaking, and pointed to a leathern
strap, which he wore tightly buckled round his by
no means slender waist. To this strap was attached,
on the left side, a very small pocket-book with steel
clasps.
"Look at it!" said the Major, pointing to the pocket-
book. “The strap is an improvement to the figure,
and a check against corpulence, to which I am so un-
happily inclined; and then how secure !”
Sir Rupert Lisle twisted his fingers in his pale lank
hair, as if he would have torn it out by the roots; but
he was too great a craven to do himself any mischief,
even in his passion, and the tearing of his hair was
only a pretence.
vio, yes, yes, yes!” he cried, writhing upon his seat
like some wounded reptile;“ you've got me fast enough.
Curse you !"
“That is so like the amiable man under whose roof
your earlier years were spent,” said the Major, smiling;
“so ready with curses and threats, and so behindhand
with deeds.”
Behindhand, Major Granville Varney ? Even at this
moment, while the echo of your ringing voice still
vibrates under the arched oaken roof, while the shadows
of the clouds flit past upon the breezy Sussex hills,
there is a man plodding through the back undergrowth
of an American forest, plodding amongst the tangled
weeds, the gnarled and rotten' stumps of fallen trees,
the sharp and thorny shrubs that catch at him and rend
his garnients as he passes, as if they too were spiteful
human things, that loved to vex and wound him in his

weariness ;-plodding on, cursing the weeds that twist
about his feet; cursing the briers and thorns that tear
his naked flesh ; cursing the black shade and the burn-
ing sun, the place to which he goes, and the people
whom he goes to seek there; cursing himself and
cursing all the world; but still with his dark face
turned steadily one way, and with a steady purpose
in his vengeful heart, that gives his feeble limbs a
strange unnatural strength, and helps him on through
all.
Gay and débonnaire, pulling his yellow moustaches,
as he traversed the long corridors and toiled up the
servants' staircase, Major Varney made his way to
the sick woman's room. He seemed, after his old
fashion, to take the sunlight with him, even into the
shadiest places, till the servants who met him suddenly
upon the dusky staircase almost winked at his yellow
brightness. The Major smiled graciously upon the
startled domestics, who were surprised to see him in that
part of the house. He paused for a moment at the door
of Rachel's room, and then, with a beaming face and
pretty musical jingle of the golden ornaments at his
watch-chain, which made a tinkling sound as he walked,
he stepped lightly into the invalid's apartment.
Rachel Arnold lay in a shadowy chamber at one
angle of the great house ; a low room, with a sloping
ceiling, crossed by thick oaken beams, and with a lat-
ticed window that was shaded by the overhanging roof.
Opposite this window was the old-fashioned tent-bed-
stead upon which the sick woman lay. Her white face
was turned towards the door of the room; her pale-
blue eyes dilated with a look of half-terror, half-anxiety.
The doctor sat in a chair near the head of the bed,
watching the patient with a thoughtful countenance,
while a rough country girl, who acted as nurse, stood
by the window, staring lazily at the tops of the trees
in the park.
“She is rather worse to-day, I am afraid," said the

231
doctor; “ there is a little tendency to wander in the
mind this morning."
As the country girl did not know the meaning of the
word “ tendency,” and as she was not quite clear as
to what “wandering in the mind” might be, she did
not attempt to answer the doctor; so that functionary
looked at the patient, and then looked at his watch,
as if he would have established a connection between
the patent engine-turned chronometer and the mind of
the sick woman; so that by winding up one, he might
contrive to regulate the other; but having looked for
a few minutes reflectively at the twinkling wheels and
jewelled holes, he elevated his eyebrows in a depre-
catory manner, as much as to say that he gave it up
for a bad job, and closed the timepiece with a metallic
snap.
“An only son! Bad, cruel, wicked, treacherous !
An only son ! an only son!”
“It's awful wearin'," said the country girl, who was
evidently out of spirits. “She's been a-doin' of it all
night, and I ain't had a wink of sleep along of her only
sons. Vegetables and saucepans was bad enough; but
this is a deal worse, goodness knows."
Now this speech is sufficiently obscure in itself; but
the young rustic had served her apprenticeship in the
basement of Lislewood House as under scullery-maid,
from which office she had been promoted to the post of
sick-nurse.
“An only son!” repeated the woman, her eyes still
fixed upon the open door. “Bad, bad! Cruel, very,
very cruel! An only son, an only son !”.
At this moment Major Granville Varney appeared on
the threshold. He was so big and so important, that
he filled up every inch of the doorway, and looked
like a picture painted in brilliant colours, and put in a
clumsy wooden frame.
The doctor sat lazily pulling on his limp thread
gloves ; the country girl yawned audibly behind her
red hands; a feeble robin twittered on the window-sill;

the cinders dropped one by one through the lower bars
of the little grate, and a mess of barley-water simmered
in the saucepan on the hob: nothing in the room or
out of the room gave any sign or recognition of Major
Varney's presence, except the invalid. With a shrill
scream the feeble creature sprang from the bed, and
throwing herself upon the astonished Major, twisted
her attenuated hands in his loose cravat, as if, weak
as she was, she would have grappled with the stalwart
Indian officer.
“You !” she shrieked—“ You! the worst of all.
Why do you come near me? Why do you let me see
your false wicked face? Why do you come where I
am, unless you want me to murder you?”
"I said so," murmured the doctor, nodding com-
placently ; “I said the mind was a little disturbed. I
expected as much.”
The girl led Rachel Arnold back to the bed. The
invalid was completely exhausted by that brief out-
burst of violence, and submitted as quietly as if she
had been a little child. Her pale hair, disordered by the
struggle, fell in straggling locks about her thin hollow
cheeks, as she lay back upon the pillow panting for
breath.
The Major brushed the doctor away from the bedside
with one wave of his hand, and seated himself on a
chair near the head of the bed as coolly as if the
invalid had welcomed him as her best and dearest
friend.
“My good Mrs. Arnold ! my dear Mrs. Arnold!” he
said, with soothing tenderness, “ this will really not do;
it won't indeed.”
“O, that cruel voice, that wicked voice !” cried the
woman, rolling her head backwards and forwards upon
the pillow with a weary motion; "that bad and wicked
voice, which I have listened to so often, and have heard
to say so many cruel words.”
“ Now, my dear soul,” continued the Major, “we
mustn't talk about wicked voices and cruel voices,

233
letting our poor dear heads run on about all sorts of
painful fancies ; but we must try and collect ourselves,
and listen quietly to our friends. I have brought you
a very kind message from Sir Rupert Lisle.”
“Sir Rupert Lisle, Sir Rupert Lisle, Sir Rupert
Lisle !” she repeated, still rolling her head backwards
and forwards upon the pillows. “An only son, an only
son!”
“Now, ain't it wearin'?" exclaimed the girl, appeal-
ing in her despair to the Major; "ain't it wearin' now?
And she does it all night, like 'rithmetic.”
Perhaps the woman heard her, and in the strange
mystery of delirium was carried back to that dim time
when she and a score of other girls had learned to
cipher at the village dame-school, for she cried, with
the same pitiful voice, “Seven times five is thirty-five;
seven times five is—Sir Rupert Lisle. Carry seven-
carry Sir Rupert Lisle. I did, I did, I did, many and
many a time; when my arms ached I've carried him,
for he was an only son—he was an only son.”
“Poor thing! poor thing !” said the Major, with a
compassionate sigh; “this is too sad; this is really
too painful. Dr. Lumkins, I should be glad to talk to
you for a few minutes in my own room. I am very
much affected by this scene, I am indeed. So this
is the young person who nurses Mrs. Arnold, is it?”
he added, looking very hard at the promoted scullery-
maid. “This is the young person, is it, who has taken
care of her all through her illness, eh?”
“Yes, that I have," answered the girl. “I ain't had
no help, and this last night or two, since she's took on
wild, I've been aʼmost frightened.”
“You have had no help,” murmured the Major. “Ah,
ah, no help at all. Good.”
Major Varney evidently uttered these vague phrases
in purely absent-minded politeness. He looked at the
girl for some moments, and then looked at the doctor,
and then at the sick woman, who, now quite exhausted,
lay with her face turned to the wall.

Lady Lisle.
“Now, then, Dr. Lumkins,” he said, after a pause,
“if you'll be so very kind as to step into my room, we
can talk over this sad case. I shall not detain you five
minutes.”
The Major occupied a handsome suite of apartments
on the sunniest side of the house. He led the doctor
into his luxurious dressing-room, from which, about a
quarter of an hour afterwards, the village practitioner
emerged, looking very grave and important.
" Then I will see Mr. Morrison this afternoon, Major
Varney,” he said, as he shook hands with the Indian
officer, “and I dare say there will be very little diffi-
culty about the certificate.”

CHAPTER XXVIII.
TOLD IN THE TWILIGHT.
BETSY JANE, the promoted scullery-maid, had a bad time
with her invalid for the rest of the day upon which the
Major paid his philanthropic visit. The sick woman
talked every hour more and more wildly. Disjointed
sentences, in which the name of Sir Rupert Lisle was
coupled with all kinds of vague delirious fancies, and
interwoven with all things the sick woman spoke of,
however common or however strange, fell every moment
from her burning lips. All the ice that the girl could
heap upon the invalid's hot head could not cool the
fever of that weary brain. Betsy Jane gave it up in
despair at last, and seating herself comfortably on a
stool by the fire, leaned her head against the brass rim
of the high fender, and composed herself to the perusal
of an interesting fiction in penny numbers, entitled
Rodolph with the Red Hand.
But as she had complained to Dr. Lumkins, she had
not slept a wink the night before, so she soon began to
get rather confused about the numbers of Rodolph,
going from XVII. to XX., and otherwise bewildering

235
herself with that romance, until at last she grew quite
unsettled as to the identity of Rodolph himself, and
falling straight from a most interesting passage into a
deep sleep, dreamed that the red-handed hero was lying
on the tent-bedstead, and talking about Sir Rupert
Lisle.
“Lady Lisle ! Lady Lisle ! Lady Lisle! fetch Lady
Lisle !"
Rodolph with the Red Hand grew so loud and shrill,
that he woke Betsy Jane, who opened her eyes with
a start that jerked her head off the brass rail of the
fender into her lap.
The sick woman had raised herself up in the bed, and
was pointing to the door. “ Lady Lisle!” she screamed;
“ fetch Lady Lisle!”
Betsy Jane stared very hard, but took no further
notice of her patient.
“Fetch her?” cried Rachel; “bring her to me, that
I may tell her all before I die! Bring her to me, that
I may save my wretched soul! Do you hear ? Bring
her to me!" Still the girl did not stir. Rachel Arnold
looked at her fiercely for a moment, and then catching
up a knife which lay beside a plate of cut lemons upon
the little table by the bed, shrieked, at the top of her
voice, “Fetch her to me, or I'll murder you!”
Betsy Jane uttered a series of loud screams, and
abruptly precipitated herself down the servants' stair.
case, and thence into the lower part of the house.
The splendid mansion had been but a dismal place of
late. Sir Rupert was almost always away-in London;
at Brighton; playing billiards at the Lislewood inn,
where Captain Walsingham had stopped years before;
at Chichester ; at Lewes; anywhere but in his own
house. There he was wretched. He sneaked about the
spacious rooms as if he had been an unauthorized in.
truder amid their splendour. Arrogant and overbearing
elsewhere, the sight of the old servants, whose fathers
and grandfathers had lived and died in the service of
the Lisles, seemed to frighten him. Olivia spent most

of her time either at the Grove, on horseback on the
downs, or in her own apartments. The Major and Mrs.
Varney had the house to themselves. To the Major the
servants looked for orders, the visitors for entertain-
ment. People began to talk about this strange state of
things. They said that Olivia Lisle and her husband
were at daggers drawn, that the young man was fast
becoming a drunkard and a profligate, and that every-
thing would go to wrack and ruin but for the exertions
of that estimable Major Varney.
It happened, however, upon this particular afternoon,
that Lady Lisle was at home. She was alone in the
long drawing-room, standing at one of the windows,
watching the ceaseless rain beating upon the glass,
when the door suddenly opened, and a face that was
strange to her was thrust a little way into the room.
The face belonged to Betsy Jane, who had never taken
breath between the garret and the drawing-room.
“What is it?" asked Lady Lisle. “What do you
want?"
“O, if you please, ma'am,” gasped the girl, "if you
please, ma'am, the sick woman, Mrs. Arnold, my lady,
she ast me to fetch you; and she taken up a knife as
lay, as it might be, just agen the bed, and she say she'd
murder me if I didn't. o, do come, my lady."
“Rachel Arnold wants me?” said Olivia, interro
gatively.
“Particular bad, my lady. She's been a-ravin' awful
all day; and she say it's to save her soul. Do come,
my lady."
"I will come, my good girl," answered Lady Lisle.
6 Poor creature! I can't think what she can want with
me. But I'll come.”
Olivia followed the girl to the room where the sick
woman lay, and, entering softly, seated herself by the
bedside.
“I've brought my lady," said Betsy Jane. " It isn't
every lady as would come all the way up here to gratify
yer worritin' nonsense.”.

Told in the Twilight.
237
“Lady Lisle! Lady Lisle.!” repeated the woman, not
looking once at Olivia.
“Well, here is Lady Lisle, ain't she?” exclaimed
the damsel; “ if that won't satisfy you, nothin'
will."
Rachel Arnold raised herself upon her elbow and
looked at Olivia.
“No! no! not this one!” she cried. “The other! the
other! This one is dark and proud, and her black eyes
shine like burning coals. I'm afraid of this one. Not
this one! the other! The other that was once counted
like me. God help me!”
“She means my mother,” said Olivia. Of late she
had always called Mrs. Walsingham her mother.
“I mean she that was fair and pale. She that mar.
ried Sir Reginald Lisle years and years ago. She that
had an only son. An only son that she loved so much,
and that some folks said was like my son. Poor lady!
poor lady! let me see her.”
“You can't see her to-day," said Olivia; "she is
away from Lislewood just now; but you shall see her
in a day or two, if you have anything particular to say
to her.”
“Particular !” cried Rachel. “It's life and death.
It's to save my wretched soul. I may die to-night.
How can I die with such a burden on my soul.”
“But if you have anything to tell, if there is any.
thing that weighs upon your mind, can you not tell
it to me?" said Olivia, soothingly. “ All that concerns
Mrs. Walsingham has the deepest interest to me, and
why not trust me ?”
"No! no !” exclaimed the woman. “No! you'd never
forgive it. You are his wife, and the injury that's been
done to you is the deepest; worse than hers—worse even
than hers. She might forgive me, for she was my old
mistress, and she knew me years ago, when I was a
happy girl, and counted like her. She might forgive
me for keeping the wicked secret; but you never could.”
“Yes, yes, tell me-if you have really any secret on

your mind that concerns Mro. Walsingham and me, tell
it to me, and I, for my part, promise to forgive.”
“You promise!” cried Rachel Arnold impatiently;
“but you don't know-you don't know. I tell you, you
can't forgive. You're passionate and proud, and you
come, I've heard, of an ancient family, and you can't
forgive."
"Yes, yes, I will,” said Olivia, alarmed by the ear.
nestness of the woman's manner. “Tell me," she
repeated, taking Rachel Arnold's hand in her own.
" Then sit with your face behind the bed-curtain,"
said Rachel, " and let me think, if I can, that you're the
other, the Lady Lisle that I knew years ago. But first
send that girl away.”
“You may go," said Lady Lisle to the disappointed
Betsy Jane, whose curiosity had been intensely aroused
by the foregoing scene. “You may go ; and mind, no
listening outside the door. Go straight downstairs, and
let me hear you go.”
The discomfited handmaiden retired; and with the
shadows of the twilight darkening her handsome face,
still darker by the shade of the curtain behind which
she sat, Olivia Lisle listened to the sick woman's con.
fession.
Whatever was uttered in those disjointed and broken
sentences, never consecutive-whatever was the secret
revealed in those half-delirious ravings, it must have
been something that vitally affected Olivia, Lady Lisle ;
for the dark face of Sir Rupert's wife was ghastly in its
pallor as she left the sick woman's chamber, and tottered
feebly down the dusky staircase, clinging to the banisters
as she went, and stopping every now and then to put her
hand to her head and murmur, with a bewildered air
“Can it be true ? Can it? Can it ?"

CHAPTER XXIX.
MIGHT AGAINST RIGHT.
LADY LISLE sat alone in the lamp-lit drawing-room
throughout that long evening upon which she had
visited the chamber of the sick woman. Pale almost to
ghastliness, she sat in a brooding attitude, crouching
over the broad fireplace, with her great hollow black
eyes vacantly staring into the red blaze at her feet.
Hour after hour was chimed by the gilded clock upon
the mantelpiece, and still the lady sat motionless, lost in
gloomy thought.
The Major and Sir Rupert had gone to Chichester
before dinner, and were not expected to return till late.
It was very rarely that Olivia troubled herself about her
hushand's actions, but on this particular evening she had
asked where the Baronet had gone, and at what hour he
was likely to come home. Eleven, twelve, one, half-past
one, a quarter to two sounded, with a pretty musical
chime, from the splendid timepiece, while Olivia still
sat with an unchanging face waiting for her husband's
coming; but at the last stroke of the three-quarters
the wheels of the Baronet's phaeton rolled along the
gravel carriage-drive below the drawing-room window,
and drew sharply up at the porch.
“ The Major is driving," muttered Olivia ; " that
pitiful coward is afraid to hold the reins after dark.”
She heard Major Varney and the Baronet talking
in the hall without Sir Rupert spoke loudly, but his
voice was thick and indistinct, and he fumbled at the
lock for some moments before he could open the draw-
ing-room door. He reeled unsteadily into the room,
and, flinging himself into the nearest chair, burst into a
loud discordant laugh.
“We've had a gl-glorious evenin', eh, old fellow ? "
he said to the Major, throwing his head back upon the
velvet cushion of the chair, with his pale lank hair hanga
ing in drunken disorder about his besotted face.


## p. 240 (#244) ############################################

240
Lady Lisle.
“My Rupert,” murmured Major Varney, reproach.
fully, - do you see Lady Lisle ? "
"What !” screamed the young man, “is she there?
No, I don't see her, and, what's more, I don't want to
see her. Curse her for a kill-joy; what do I want with
her white face and great black eyes, and her grand
airs ? I'll teach her to treat me to her airs. I'll make
her know who I am, d- n her!”
So vile a coward was he on ordinary occasions, that
the factitious audacity engendered of strong drink was
a surprise to himself. He felt proud of his own temerity,
and he slapped his hand upon his thigh with a trium-
phant gesture as he looked about him.
Lady Lisle rose from her low chair and walked
straight over to the young man.
“Suppose I do know who you are !” she said, stand-
ing before him, and looking down at his face with an
expression of unutterable disgust.
The Major had been lounging in the open doorway,
half in the room and half out of it, languidly drawing
off his lemon-coloured kid gloves, but as Olivia uttered
these few words, he suddenly changed his attitude, and,
after carefully shutting the door, placed himself with
his back to it.
“Suppose I do know who you are!” repeated Lady
Lisle, her eyes flashing flames of fire. “ Suppose, to my
bitter cost and shame, that I do know who you are, and
all about you!"
Her nostrils and her upper lip quivered in the in-
tensity of her excitement. She was obliged to rest her
hand upon the table near which she stood, in order
to support herself, for her whole frame was shaken by a
conyulsive trembling.
“My dear Lady Lisle,” said the Major, with a certain
expression on his face, which showed that he was listen.
ing intently for any sound without, “I really did not
expect this from you ; with your powerful intellect, it is
positively the last thing I should have expected.”
"I tell you,” cried Olivia, her voice vibrating, clear

241
and loud, through the lofty room-"I tell you that I
know all about the base and wicked plot that has been
carried out by that vile tool, and I know your infamous
share in it, Major Varney. Why, look at him!” she
cried, with passionate vehemence, pointing to her hus-
band as she spoke- look at him, as he sits there in his
stupid drunkenness—more brutal than the oxen that
sleep in his fields-lower than the lowest brute in his
stables. Good heavens! what a pitiful dupe I must have
been to have been deceived by such a thing as that!”
She burst into an hysterical laugh as she looked with
ineffable contempt at the young man.
The Major quietly took the key from the lock of the
door, and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket; then, ad-
vancing to Lady Lisle, he tried to take her hands in his.
“ Lady Lisle," he said, “listen to me!”.
She snatched her hand indignantly from him.
“ Lady Lisle!” she cried. “Hypocrite, plotter, trick.
ster, cheat ! how dare you call me by that false and
lying name! which has never-no, never for one poor
hour been my own. O, fool, fool, fool!” she moaned,
her rage and scorn changing to a tone of anguish.
“ Fool, to sell my soul for pomp and grandeur, to
sacrifice an earnest and noble heart, for what-for what?
For an impostor, whose name is a lie, and who fattens
upon the wealth of another man."
Sir Rupert Lisle stared aghast at his infuriated wife.
He pushed his hair out of his watery eyes, and seemed
in a breath to recover from his drunken torpor, and to
be all his cowardly self again.
• She has been talking to that she-devil upstairs," he
said, looking piteously at the Major, “and she has told
her "
“She has told me everything," interrupted Olivia.
“ Your poor unhappy ill-used mother has told me all,
and who and what the so-called Sir Rupert Lisle really
is.”
Major Varney shrugged his shoulders with a depre-
catory smile.

242
Lady Lisle.
“As I said a little time ago, Lady Lisle,” he mur.
mured, “you are the very last person from whom I
should have expected this. Come, now,” he added, in
his most soothing tone, wheeling a chair towards Olivia
-“come, let us sit down and try to ascertain what is
the meaning of all this."
She was so exhausted by the violence of her passion,
that she had no power left to oppose him, so she sank
into the chair be offered to her.
“Now, then,” he said, “let us try to understand this
case. You have been so very imprudent as to suffer
yourself to be induced to pay a visit to the sick woman
in the upper floor of this house?”
“I have seen that woman," Olivia answered, hoarsely.
"And that unfortunate creature, who has been, as it
is notorious to several persons, out of her mind for some
days past, has been entertaining you with her delirious
hallucinations."
“She has told me what I know and feel to be the
hideous truth!” said Olivia, looking full at the Major.
“I wish to Heaven it were false.”
"O, you know and feel that what she has told you
is true," murmured the Major. “May I ask if she has
given you any proof in support of her preposterous
statements ?"
“No actual proof, perhaps," said Olivia.
“No actual proof, eh?” asked the Major, smiling
radiantly upon the unhappy woman. “Has she given
you any proof whatever, —the shadow of a proof, how-
ever slight? No!” he cried, raising his voice in his
triumph; “I will wager not. She has simply told you
that she is the mother of a gentleman of high birth,
whose real mother has publicly recognized and acknow-
ledged him; and she has told you some cock-and-a-bull
story about a plot as preposterous and impracticable as
anything ever dreamt of out of a three-volume novel.
This is what she has done, is it not ?."
“She has revealed your part in the wicked scheme,"
said Olivia ; "the cruel scheme which you yourself con.

243
cocted, finding, with the despicable cowardice on a villain,
a meaner instrument to carry it out."
“My dear Lady Lisle,” said the Major, in no wise
agitated by the accusations hurled at him by Olivia,
“my dear Lady Lisle, I throw myself upon your com-
mon sense. Only submit to be guided by that, and we
shall very quickly understand each other. Supposing
that I had ever dreamed of such a plot as that of which
you speak, do you think I should have chosen Rachel
Arnold as a confidante? Do you think I should have
been mad enough or stupid enough to trust my secret
to a poor weak half-witted sickly creature, who might
take it into her addled head to betray me at any mo.
ment? Is that feasible? Is it likely? Good heavens !
is it even possible ?”.
“She was very incoherent,” said Olivia; “but I
think, from what she said, that she had overheard some
conversation between you and her husband.”
“Lady Lisle," answered the Major, gravely, “I am
very sorry that you should have even given way to such
an outburst as this of to-night. You have been listening
to the ravings of a madwoman-in whom a long and
troublesome illness has developed a hallucination, not
perhaps so incomprehensible, if we bear in mind that
Rachel Arnold once had a son about the age of Sir
Rupert--and you are so influenced by this unhappy
creature, as to come and tell your husband, in very vio-
lent language, that he is not the person he pretends to
be, and, further, to accuse me of being a party to the
deception. Now, supposing that it were to your interest
to support this assertion by proof, which it never can
be, since to do so would only render you the laughing-
stock of all Sussex, as the woman who sold herself
to a man for his rank and fortune, and found that
she had married a beggar-if, I say, it were to your
interest to prove this, what proof could you bring
forward ?"
Olivia was silent.
“You say that our friend there is not the real

Lady Lisle.
Baronet, and that the actual Sir Rupert Lisle is now
living. May I ask where ?”
“I cannot tell you."
“I thought not,” murmured the Major. “ It is not in
your power to produce him, and it is not likely to be in
your power to produce him, eh?”
“I fear not."
“Good. And pray may I ask when Mrs. Rachel
Arnold last saw him alive ?”
“When he was removed from the hospital, upwards
of fifteen years ago.”
“Fifteen years !” repeated Major Varney; “ a long
time, my dear Lady Lisle. And on the strength of the
ravings of a woman who has been pronounced by her
medical attendant to be out of her mind, and without
any other proof whatsoever, you would charge your
husband as an impostor. We are not afraid of you, Lady
Lisle, for our position rests upon substantial proof, and
if you choose to bring forward the witness of a mad-
woman, we can show the evidence of that madwoman's
husband, in the shape of the formal deposition made by
Gilbert Arnold, and duly signed by him, in the presence
of the Baronet's lawyers.”
“Heaven help me?” cried Olivia, clasping her hands
together passionately ; “my instinct tells me that the
woman has spoken the truth.”
“Your instinct would go very little way towards the
support of your case in a court of law, my dear Lady
Lisle," said the Major. “We are not afraid of you, are
we, ny Rupert ? We are not afraid of you, or of Mrs.
Arnold either; indeed, there is only one person whom
Sir Rupert Lisle need fear, and that person is Major
Granville Varney."
He struck his hand upon his side playfully as he spoke,
touching the little pocket-book strapped under his waist-
coat, so that the steel chain and padlock jingled. The
Baronet shuddered at the sound.
“Heayen help me, and teach me what to do in my
misery !” exclaimed Olivia.

Might against Right.

“I should recommend you to let well alene, my dear
madam, rather than to create a useless disturbance,
which would render you an object of pity to all the
county, as an ambitious woman, who was duped by the
low-bred son of a poaching vagabond. Why, your case
would be paragraphed in every newspaper in England,
and you would go down to posterity as a second 'Lady
of Lyons.'"
Olivia Lisle disputed no further with the Indian
officer. She felt herself utterly powerless when placed
in opposition to this man, who was supreme master of
all the arts of falsehood. Wearied out and despairing,
she retired to her own apartments, to lie awake all
through the long dismal night, brooding over the events
of the day. Early the next morning, as she was crossing
the hall, she saw a fly standing at the door, and two
strange men lounging upon the steps of the portico.
“Who are you waiting for?” she asked of one of
them, a great broad-shouldered fellow, with a red hand-
kerchief muffled round his throat.
“We're a-waiting for the person for the asylum, mum;
and a power of a time she is too,” answered the man.
“ The asylum! What asylum ?” cried Olivia.
“The County Lunatic Asylum, ma'am, for pauper
lunatics."
Before Lady Lisle could ask another question, Rachel
Arnold tottered into the hall, supported on one side by
the country girl who had nursed her, and on the other
by a hard-faced-looking woman, who had come from
the asylum to assist in the removal of the patient. The
wretched creature was as white as death, and trembled
violently.
“O, my lady, my lady !" she cried, piteously, “ don't
let them take me away—pray, pray, pray don't let them
take me! I'm not mad-indeed, indeed I'm not! What
I told you was as true as gospel ; every word was the
cruel bitter truth.”
“Stop!” cried Olivia. “Stop, I insist! What is the
meaning of this ?”

Lady Lisle.
“It means, Lady Lisle,” said Major Varney, opening
the door of the library, “it means that when people
become the victims of the hallucinations of a disordered
brain, it is high time that they should be placed in con.
finement, or else,” added the Major, “ they might come
in time to influence the minds of others, their superiors
in station, until they made them as mad as themselves.
And remember, my dear Lady Lisle, that the highest
rank will not save any one from a madhouse.”
The hard-faced woman and one of the men dragged
Rachel Arnold towards the steps of the portico, but
upon the very threshold of the house she stopped sud-
denly, and lifting up her thin and wasted hands,
shrieked aloud,
“My curses be upon this house, and the wicked crea-
tures within it!”.
CHAPTER XXX.
POOR RICHARD.
The winter snows melted away from the broad common
outside Belminster; the crocuses in Mr. Hayward's
garden were succeeded by bright daffodils and scented
jonquils ; blue violets hid themselves under blackthorn
hedges, and primroses and fragile white anemones car-
peted the sombre recesses of the woods, and still Blanche
Hayward's simple round of duty wore away the busy
hours of every useful day; still the handsome curate
went about his work with a gloomy face and a preoc-
cupied manner; still the plain-spoken rector fought his
life-long battle with the sins of poor feeble human na-
ture; and still Richard Saunders occupied the master's
seat in the new National School. With the spring sun.

pale brown hair, he sits amongst his noisy scholars,
patiently expounding some simple lesson that they have

just repeated. But, indefatigable as he is, and much as
he is beloved by his rustic pupils, the stranger's first
thought on seeing him is that he is out of place in the
humble school. The dreamy blue eyes have a vague and
yearning look. There is something of a nervous rest-
lessness in the schoolmaster's manner that does not
bespeak an entirely contented mind. But whatever he
may think or feel, he does his duty bravely, and the
rough boys love their gentle master with an honest
devotion that reveals itself in a hundred homely ways.
They bring him big bunches of flowers from their cottage
gardens; they rise before daybreak in order that they
may decorate his rooms with their nosegays; they run
miles to fetch any book which he wants, for they know
that he is a great scholar, and they stare at him in open-
mouthed wonder, as he pores over some heavy volume
borrowed from a neighbouring parson. A shelf in his
little sitting-room is loaded with books, bought out of
his pocket-money in those days when uncle George's
allowance enabled him to gratify his studious tastes.
This May afternoon he is especially grave and silent,
and he says very little to the boys as he dismisses them:
so that, indeed, two or three of them go away quite dis-
concerted, whispering to each other that the teacher has
something on his mind. When they are all gone, Richard
Saunders relapses into a reverie, with his blue eyes fixed
upon the open window, where, across a simple cottage
garden and a neatly-trimmed hedgerow, he can see the
winding pathway over the common, by which Blanche
had brought him in the winter to see the new-built
school-house.
“ Will she come?" he murmured. “She promised
to bring me the last Quarterly as soon as she got it
from the book-club; she is so good, so energetic, so
untiring, that she is sure to keep her promise. Yes, I
know she will come.”
The thought seemed to fill him with a vague sense
of pleasure. He walked to the hanging bookshelf, and
having selected a volume, began to read, with his face

till turned towards the window and the winding path
hat led from Belminster.
“Even if she does come to bring the book," he said,
y-and-by, “what of it? She would do the same for
The oldest pauper in Belminster, if he had a taste for
reading, and she thought it her duty to give him plea-
sure. She is so different from other girls, that a man
must be the vilest coxcomb who construed any act of
hers into a token of preference or regard.”
The thought made him very gloomy, and he rose from
his chair, to take two or three hurried turns up and
down the uncarpeted room.
He was not a handsome young man, but there was a
delicacy and refinement in his appearance that made
him peculiarly attractive. His clothes were simple in
material and subdued in colour, but wear what he
would, he must always have looked a gentleman. As
he paced up and down the room, a bright face looked
in at the latticed window, and a merry voice ex-
claimed, -
“What, Richard! this is impatience! Marching
about like a hungry lion waiting for his dinner, be
cause, I suppose, I am late with your cherished Quar-
torly. I am sorry to tell you that the articles are
dreadfully dull in this number; I have not been able to
read half a dozen pages. Shall I come in-”
“O, if you will, please, yes,” he stammered.
“Very well, then,” said Blanche. “I've all sorts of
messages for you from papa, and a great deal to say to
you myself; so I'll come in and sit down for about ten
minutes."
The young man flew to open the door for his visitor,
who walked into the schoolroom, and ensconced her-
self in the chair of office. For about ten minutes she
ran on, telling Richard all sorts of things-commissions
she wanted him to execute, inquiries he was to make
about the parents of his pupils, and other business-like
matters. But the schoolmaster was very silent. He
leaned against the window-sill, with his back to the

249
dusky light, and with one white girlish hand playing
restlessly with his slender watch-chain.
Blanche noticed his preoccupied manner, and said to
him atlast, rather impatiently, “Why, Richard Saunders,
you are not attending to me a bit. I don't believe you
have understood a single word I have said.”
“I have not, I have not, Miss Hayward,” cried the
young man, with a sudden and passionate energy ; “I
only hear your voice, and that is such melody to me
that I am intoxicated with its music, and forget to
listen to your words.”
“Richard !” she said
“O, yes!” he exclaimed, bitterly; "tell me that I
forget my place; that your kindness has made me inso-
lent. Go to your father, Blanche, and tell him that he
has misplaced his bounty, for that the young man who
owes a home to his kindness has repaid that kindness
by daring to love his daughter."
“ Richard ! Richard ! ” cried Blanche, with a pitying
sadness. “No, no, no!”
You do not tell me of my presumption, Miss Hay-
ward ? »
“No, Richard. What presumption can there be in
these words from you to me; we who are equals by
education and feeling, as we are most likely equals by
birth ? "
“What !” exclaimed Richard, his pale face radiant
with hope. “ Can you mean what you say? Is it pos-
sible ? Can it be that you will listen "
“Not to one word, Richard,” she said, with decision.
“Not to one word. O, Richard ! Richard ! why did
such an idea as this ever enter your head? Why were
you not content with those quiet studies amidst which
you were so happy? Do you know what a bitter thing
it is to love, and to love without hope? Do you know
the grief and shame of thinking night and day of one
who never thinks of you ? O, Richard ! you are
but a boy yet, and I speak to you as I might
speak to some dear younger brother, and I warn you,

Lady Lisle.
as I might warn him, to cast this silly fancy from your
heart."
She had spoken with an unwonted fire and animation,
her grey eyes lighted with a feverish lustre, and a
burning blush crimsoning her cheek.
“Is there no hope, then? Is there no hope, Blanche ?
Remember, I am but a boy, as you have said, and my
poverty is a thing of to-day. I will work till I get the
means for a university education, I will go into the
Church, I will make myself your equal in station; and
then, then, Blanche, when I have done all this, would
there still be no hope ? "
“None, Richard, none!”.
The gentle gravity of her manner, the earnest sad-
ness of her voice, would have told the dullest wooer
that his case was indeed hopeless. Richard Saunders
hid his face in his hands and sobbed aloud. At this
moment the threshold was darkened by the shadow of
the curate of Belminster.
“May I come in ? " asked Walter, entering the
room without waiting for an answer. “Miss Hay-
ward, good evening to you. Richard, how are you
to-night?"
He laid his hand, as he spoke, on the young man's
shoulder, and felt that his whole frame was shaken
by convulsive sobs.
“Why, Richard! Richard !” he said gently, “what
is this ? 31
“You have been very good to me, Mr. Remorden,"
said the young man, “and I have confided in you as I
might have done had you been my elder brother. You
know, you know how I love her. She will forgive me
for telling you that I have told her so to-night.”
“Yes, yes.”
“And she has forbidden me to hope, either in the
present or for the future. Heaven bless her! an angel
might have spoken as she spoke to me this night; but
for all that she has broken my heart.”.
The curate could not see Blanche's face. She had

251
leaned her head upon her hand, and sat looking at the
ground.
“My children, my children," said Walter gently,
“ for you seem almost children to me, is there nothing
hasty in this decision? You appear so suited to each
other in every way that I had hoped a better issue.
Miss Hayward, give me your hand. How cold it is,
poor little hand! Come, let us sit round the window
in this dim twilight, and I will tell you a love-story; a
true one too, with a sad ending, but with a good moral,
that perhaps you may do well to remember.”
CHAPTER XXXI.
THE CURATE'S STORY.
" It is generally an understood thing,” said Mr. Remor-
den, seating himself with his back to the window, and
his face in the shadow, “that a man ought to be
ashamed of ever having been a victim to a hopeless
passion, and, above all, of having been jilted by the girl
he loved. However this may be, I freely acknowledge
to you both that I come amongst the unhappy category
of men who have been jilted.”
Blanche started slightly as the curate made this con-
fession, but neither she nor Richard spoke.
“Until to-night,” continued Walter Remorden, “I
have never uttered a word of this to any creature
breathing. I have borne my own burdens, and I have
tried to do my duty. But when I see this poor boy
mourning over shipwrecked hopes and broken dreams,
I can perhaps best console him by telling him how the
hopes of others have gone down in the storm of life,
leaving nothing but ruin behind.”
Blanche sat with her earnest grey eyes fixed upon
the curate's face, but Richard's head sank upon the
humble desk at which he was accustomed to write.
“ Some years ago, I formed an attachment to a woman
who was, to my mind womanly perfection. I know,

252

now that she was not faultless. I remember the
haughty temper, the proud contempt for the low
meannesses of others, and those bright ambitious
dreams, which were a part of her nature, and which
would perhaps have better become the struggling spirit
of a man. But with faults like these, she had a heart
so brave and noble, a mind so far removed from every
lowering thought, that still I can only think that she
was worthy of all love. Heaven knows how truly I loved
her; I know that she loved me. I never saw that love
so plainly as a few weeks before her marriage with
another."
“She loved you, and yet married another man!”
exclaimed Blanche.
“She did. We had been friends from childhood ;
her father was fond of me, and my happiest hours were
spent beneath his roof. She was very young, not quite
seventeen, when I left the neighbourhood for a curacy
at a distance. We parted with no actual engagement,
but with a tacit understanding that on my return she
should become my wife. I felt so secure in my belief
in her truth, in my assurance that her love was as sin- &
cere as my own, that I never dreamed of seeking to
bind her by any formal promise. How could she wrong
me? Was she not my second self, a part of my very
being ?”
“And yet she deceived you ?” murmured Blanche.
"I was away three years. We did not correspond
during that time, for as yet our attachment was a secret
from her father. I heard of her constantly through
others, who saw hør daily. During that three years'
probation I was perfectly happy. My faith in my dear
love was so entire, that I looked forward to our future
union as only contingent upon life itself. Perhaps
Heaven was angry with me for making an idol of an
earthly creature; perhaps my very love became sinful.
If it was indeed so, my punishment was a bitter and a
terrible one."
He paused for some moments, as if lost in melan-

253
choly retrospection; neither of his hearers interrupted
him, and presently he resumed:-
“I worked very hard—less, perhaps, in the desire to
do my duty than from the wish to make my name
known in the diocese as a worthy object for advance-
ment in the Church, and for her sake. I was on foot
from morning till night, for I would not afford myself
a horse, in my desire to save money enough to furnish
a house elegantly when the happy time came for my
marriage. Knocked up with fatigue, excitement, anxiety,
and hard work, I was obliged at last to succumb, and
I fell seriously ill. It was during this illness, when I
was lonely and broken-spirited, attended only by the
honest country woman with whom I lodged, that I
heard, quite by accident, of my darling's approaching
marriage with a very rich man, a baronet, whose
estates lay in the neighbourhood of her home.”
As the curate paused for an instant, his voice broken
by emotion, Blanche drew a little nearer to þin, and
laid her cold hand upon his own.
“You feel for me, Blanche,” he said; “I knew, I
knew you would. You will forgive me now for my
gloomy looks, my moods of dull abstraction, my indif-
ference to the attractions of those who possess womanly
graces worthy of all love and admiration. The blow
was a very bitter one; for some time I was stunned by
it, and lay day after day in my feeble, half-delirious
state, wondering if I had heard aright, and if it could
indeed be true that the woman I had so fully trusted
had betrayed me."
“ She must have been the most heartless "
“Stay, Blanche! Do not utter one reproachful word.
Heaven knows that I have long ago forgiven her, poor
girl! for I doubt if the step she took was not one cal-
culated to bring upon her a life of misery. As soon as
I could rise from my sick bed, a fever seemed to possess
me; I felt that, come what might, I must return to the
old home, and assure myself with my own eyes and ears
that it was indeed as people said. The kind vicar's

wife gladly welcomed a poor broken-down invalid be-
neath her hospitable roof, and I found myself once more
within a couple of miles of her whom I had thought to
call my wife.”
“Did you see her ?" asked Blanche.
“I did. Once only; yet I saw, in that one brief
interview, that the marriage was dictated by ambition
alone; that her feelings towards myself had never
altered, but that she had been unable to resist the
temptations of wealth and position. Poor girl! she
had been reared in the very lap of poverty; she had
seen it in its bitterest shape-the poverty of the high-
born and proud. I could not feel all this then, but I
have learned to remember it since. That night I did
not see her only, I also saw the future bridegroom-
“And he said Blanche.
“0, Blanche, do not ask me what he was! I saw
him, and then indeed I felt the real bitterness of her
desertion. Then, when I beheld the low-minded vul.
garian to whom she was about to ally herself. He was
the heir to one of the oldest names in Sussex, but I do
not think there could have been a labouring man upon
his vast estate one half as boorish or ill-mannered, as
mean in person or in soul!”
“ And yet he was a-gentleman ?”
“ By birth, yes. But there were peculiar circum-
stances attending his childhood and youth, which, as
some said, accounted for his loutish manners and vulgar
mind. My heart sank when I saw him, and felt that
on the caprice of a coward and a tyrant hung the future
happiness of the woman I adored. From that time to
this I have never heard of her, for I purposely avoid any
mention of her in my letters, and others, who know or
guess my feelings, avoid it also. Heaven knows what
her life may have been. My heart sickens when I
think of her, for I would not of my own will trust a
dog to the tender mercies of Sir Rupert Lisle.”
Throughout the curate's story, Richard Saunders had
not once spoken or lifted his head from its recumbent

255
position upon the desk before him ; but on the mention
of the Baronet's name, he started from his seat, and,
ghastly pale in the dusk, cried, in wild and terrified
accents,
“Sir Rupert Lisle! Are you mad, as well as I? It
is the very name—the very name—which I have neither
heard nor spoken for twelve long years.”
“What do you mean, Richard ?” exclaimed Blanche
Hayward, almost alarmed for the young man's sanity.
"I mean, that when I was a child I had a dangerous
fever which made me mad, and my madness was to
fancy myself Sir Rupert Lisle!”.
CHAPTER XXXII.
ON THE TRAMP.
On a cross road, about twenty miles from Liverpool, on
the London side of that seaport, a man toiled under the
meridian heat of a blazing July day. His smock-frock
hung about him in tatters; his hobnailed boots scarcely
held together upon his weary feet; the felt hat which
he wore had evidently been battered about in so many
storms that every trace of its original shape was for
ever lost. He carried a pitiful little wallet, hanging to
a thick staff. The man himself had seen no small
amount of foul weather. But for the thoroughly Eng-
lish oaths which, every now and then, escaped in mut-
tered execrations from his lips, you would have taken
him for a native of some southern climate, so bronzed
was his face from constant exposure to the burning sun.
Though the road on which he tramped along was very
lonely, he sneaked aloug with a skulking walk, always
keeping close to the hedge, as if he had a fear of being
seen by some dire foe. He was not the most prepos-
sessing of men, and I think, had you come upon him
suddenly in that lonely lane, you would have felt a cer.
tain vague alarm facere the safety of your watch and

Lady Lisle.
purse, if not for the security of your life. The lane,
too, had something of a cut-throat air about it, and
seemed altogether a convenient lane for foul deeds and
villanous attacks upon innocent men. At one end of
this lane there was a hillock, upon which, in the good
old times gone by, many a malefactor had been hung in
chains, making himself in death, as he had been in life,
the terror of the country side; by reason of which the
spot is to this day called Gibbet Hill.
It was at the foot of this Gibbet Hill that the weary
foot-passenger flung himself down to rest, uttering, as
he did so, another of those execrations by means of
which he had contrived to relieve the monotony of the
road. He took from his wallet a wretched bone and
some morsels of bread, and, opening a clasp-knife of
murderous dimensions, set to work at his miserable
meal. When he had scraped the bone so clean that the
hungriest cur prowling in a gutter would have spurned
even to inspect it, he shut his knife, put it into his
breast-pocket, and, finging himself upon the flat of his
back, took a screw of tobacco from his waistcoat-pocket,
and began to fill a blackened clay pipe which he had
carried in the band of his battered hat.
" Nigh upon two hundred mile from where I want to
go," he muttered, in a sulky growl; “foot-sore and
broken down, tired and hungry, with about three shillin'
in my pocket to take me them two hundred mile. It
does seem hard."
He garnished this speech with so many oaths, that he
made it nearly double the length at which it is written
here, and then, having lighted his pipe, began to smoke
short angry puffs, as if he owed the tobacco a grudge,
and was struggling fiercely to get the better of it. By
this means he finished his pipe in no time, and, as his
diminutive stock of the soothing weed obliged him to
be economical, he stuck the little bit of blackened clay
into his hatband, and composed himself to sleep. He
had slept some time when he was awakened by the
barking of a dog close at his heels. He opened his eyes

257
with one of his favourite oaths, and, looking up, saw a
stalwart gipsy, seated on a donkey, in the roadway
before the hillock, contemplating him earnestly.
“Hallo, mate,” he said good-naturedly, “ain't you
a good ’un to snore, that's all !".
* Call off that varmint of a dog of yourn, will yer ?”
roared out the awakened traveller ; “unless you want
me to brain him for you.”
But he was so enfeebled by his long tramp, that he
exhausted himself with his angry vehemence, and fell
back upon the grass, impotent to do any mischief.
"You wake up uncommon savage, comrade ; and if
that's the sort of temper you always wake in, I shouldn't
think sleep agreed with your constitootion," said the
gipsy, dangling his long legs over the sides of his don-
key. “But you don't look over-strong, my friend;
you've been on the tramp some time, I take it, and
you're rather tired.”
“I am tired," answered the other, fiercely, “and I
am savage. Why must you needs come rousing me out
of the only bit of sleep I've had these fourteep hours ?
I was happy while I was asleep, for I was dreamin'."
“Was yon dreamin' you'd got some wittles ?” asked
the gipsy, laughing.
“No, I wasn't," growled the tramp;“I was dreamin'
of somethin' sweeter than wittles; though, Lord knows,
I'm hungry enough to think 'em sweet, though they was
the coarsest meat as ever a fine gentleman set before his
foxhounds. I was dreamin' of that which is sweeter
than food, or drink, or money--sweeter than life
a'most,_I was dreamin' that I had my revenge.”
In the fervour of his passion he rose from his re-
clining position, and struck his staff violently upon the
ground.
“Why, Lord save us," cried the gipsy, “what a
regular savage one you are! I wouldn't like to offend
you."
“Let them beware as has offended me, that's all !”
said the other.

258
Lady Lisle.
“ You look awful bad,” muttered the gipsy, as he
stared full at the haggard face of the wayfarer.
“I am awful bad,” he answered moodily; "and I've
been worse, and I may be worse again; but for all that,
I'll go through with it. I've had a fever that laid me
days and nights stretched on niy back on a heap of
rags, in a hole not fit for that dog to lie in; but still
I've gone through with it. I've had rheumatism till
this carcase of mine seemed nothing but one wretched
bundle of aches and pains and sore bones; but still I've
gone on with it. Strike me blind and lame!” he cried,
with increasing fury in every word he uttered," strike
me blind and lame if I turn from it now that I've got
so near the end !" He was so weak that his voice broke
at the last words, and he began to cough violently.
“I'll tell you what, mate," said the gipsy, “you seem
a deal too bad to be on tramp to-day. Our people's
place is right agen here, and I dare say, with a word or
two from me, and if you'll keep a civil tongue in your
head yerself, they'll be willing enough to give you a
night's lodging.”
The tramp gave a sulky acceptance to this kind offer,
and the gipsy, dismounting from his donkey, told the
other to get upon the animal.
“You're fit to drop,” he said, “I know. I'm strong
enough. It'll do me good to stretch my legs a bit.”
The gipsy encampment was in a corner of the lane,
about a mile from where the tramp had been lying-a
pleasant, shady spot, overhung with elders and pollard
willows, with a thick screen of beeches towering above
them, and with a reedy pool below. Here, amongst
grass and rushes, lay two or three men, smoking lazily,
and making mats. A couple of dogs were on guard
under a covered van, and a woman was sitting upon
one of the shafts peeling potatoes.' Another woman,
younger and handsomer than her companion, lay asleep
with her head upon an old shawl. With the exception
of this sleeper, they all looked up as the gipsy and the
tramp approached.

“Hallo, Abraham!” cried one of the men, “who
have you got there?”
“ A tramp as I've picked up asleep under Gibbet Hill,
and as it would be a charity to give a mouthful of
victuals and a night's rest. Are you agreeable, Ben ?"
“As to that,” said the man, “ we ain't got much, but
what we have he's free to take his share of. Don't
wake Britannia. Poor lass! she's just dropped off
quiet, and it ain't often she sleeps much."
The tramp wondered why the man spoke of the
sleeping girl with so much consideration. She was
very handsome, but looked haggard and careworn. The
lines about her thin lips were painfully compressed, and
there were dark hollow circles round her closed eyes.
“You might lend a hand with these mats, comrade,
between this and supper-time,” said one of the men.
"By the bye, what's your name?”
The man scratched his head thoughtfully for a few
moments, as if half doubtful whether or not to answer
the gipsy's question.
“ John Andrews,” he said curtly.
* John Andrews. And how do you pick up your
living, Muster Andrews ? "
“Sometimes one way and sometimes another; scarcely
any way lately. I've been starvin' more than livin' for
the last few months; but I'll go through with it."
He said this, not to the gipsy, but to himself. His
hollow eyes seemed a-blaze with an evil light, as if he
had some shut-up fiend in his breast that sustained
him, and gave him strength to bear up through every-
thing. He sat down presently, and gave a hand with
the mats, as the man had requested him. He did it
awkwardly enough, his great coarse fingers boggling
strangely with the woven rushes; but, after his sulky
fashion he worked pretty willingly, and the men wero
satisfied. At dusk the woman who had peeled the
potatoes poured some savoury mess out of a pot that
had hung over a wood fire by the side of the van, and
brought a stone jug of beer and somo knives and forks

and rough crockery-ware from the head-quarters of the
little company. After which simple preparations she
told the men that supper was ready.
John Andrews's eyes shone with a hungry glare as
he smelt the homely food, and he watched the woman
doling out the mess into half a dozen tin plates with
the ravenous impatience of a half-starved bull-dog.
The girl who had been asleep all the evening opened
her eyes at the noise of the rattling of the plates, and
looked about her.
“Come, Britannia," said the man they called Abra-
ham, “come, my lass, you've had a good sleep ; wake
up and eat a bit of supper.”
“I ain't hungry,” she answered, shaking her head in
a weary preoccupied manner. “You are all on you
very good to me, but I don't need it. I only want to
get there." She looked straight before her at the low
purple horizon-line, with luminous eyes and compressed
lips, rigid as though they had been cut from stone. “I
only want to get there!”
The men looked from one to the other. Vague as her
speech was, they evidently understood its meaning. She
ate nothing but a morsel of bread and cheese; but the
men did good justice to the stew of meat and vegetables,
and John Andrews devoured every morsel that fell in
his way.
“And now, comrade," said one of the gipsies, as they
lighted their pipes after supper, “what may be your
intentions after to-night?"
“To go on," answered John Andrews, resolutely.
“On the tramp ?"
“Yes, on the tramp."
“ Then why not keep along with us? We could make
you useful, one way and another, for I suppose you are
not particular what you turn your hand to."
“No, not over-particular, Lord knows !” answered
Mr. Andrews, with a sinister grin.
“Then why not keep along with us?” urged the
other.

“ Because there's only one way in all England that
it'll suit me to go, and it ain't very likely you're a-goin'
that way.”
“No more it ain't," muttered the gipsy, reflectively.
“We're a-goin' a pretty long step, too, and, what's
more, we ain't a-goin' so much along of business as to
please a fancy of that poor lass there. We're a-goin' to
some races on the other side of London.”
" I'm a-goin' to the other side of London," muttered
John Andrews.
“We're a-goin' to some races in Sussex. We was
there last fall, and we picked up a good bit one way
and another; but we had a misfortune that has well-
nigh turned the brain of yon poor lass "
“What part of Sussex, man?” said John Andrews,
impatiently. “Never mind the girl—what part of Sus-
sex?”
“ Chilton downs, ten miles from Chichester.”
It was nearly dark, and the men only saw each other's
faces by the brief glare of a lucifer-match, when any
member of the party lighted his pipe. John Andrews
did not speak for some moments, and when he did, it
was only to say quietly,–
“I'll keep along with you, comrades.”
The men shook hands all round after this; the gipsies
with honest goodwill and friendliness, the tramp with
the self-restrained moody manner peculiar to him, as if
the fiend shut up in his breast forbade his holding
friendly communion with his fellow-men.
Later in the evening he said, as if the thought had
only just struck him,
“ Why does yon lass want to go to Chilton downs ? "
"On account of a poor sister of hers as lies buried
not far from there," answered Abraham, the gipsy.
The young woman caught at the words, though she
had heard nothing else that the man had said.
“A beautiful girl," she murmured, “ a beautiful girl,
not eighteen years old, and with as true a heart as ever
beat. My poor Susannah! my poor Susannah !”

Lady Lisle.
She buried her face in her hands and moaned aloud,
rocking herself to and fro.
“Why does she take on so about her sister?" asked
Andrews.
“It's a long story, mate,” said Abraham, “but may-
be I'll it tell you when we've been together a bit longer.
It's not a tale one likes to tell strangers, somehow.”
The woman lifted her head, and looked with flashing
eyes at the little group.
“It should be told to all the world," she cried; “it
should be told under the open sky to all the multitudes
of the wide earth. The cruel, wicked, shameful story!
But you'll take me there, won't you?” she said, im-
ploringly. “You've sworn, Abraham, that you'd take
one there."
“I will, lass; I'll keep my word.”
“And you'll set me face to face with him ?”
“Face to face."
“Bless you, Abraham, for a good and true lad!”
Exhausted by her passion and grief, the gipsy girl
threw herself upon the ground again, and fell into a
restless slumber.
“She's a little touched, ain't she?” muttered An-
drews, putting his hand to his head.
“A little, I'm afraid, poor wench. She's had sorrow
enough to turn the brain of the wisest upon the earth.
Poor lass! she was to have been my wife, mate, and we
counted on being as happy as the day is long together;
and it's hard, somehow, to see her like that."
The men drank all the beer out of the stone jar
amongst them, and by the time the stars grew out of
the grey skies, they had abandoned themselves to good
fellowship. Even John Andrews seemed to forget, for
a time, the demon shut up in his breast, and joined the
merriment of the others with a boorish mirth of his
own, well meant, no doubt, but by no means fascinating.
Every now and then, too, he broke in upon the general
conversation by crying out, “ I'll keep along with you,
mates—I'll keep along with you!”

CHAPTER XXXIII.
WAY THE GIPSIES HATED SIR RUPERT LISLE.
The Chilton racecourse lay high upon a great piece of
common land, three miles from either town or village.
The spot was a favourite rendezvous for tramps and
gipsies, but very little frequented by anybody else, ex-
cept, indeed, when some farmer, returning from Chilton
market, saved a quarter of a mile by driving across the
steep hill, on the very summit of which was perched
a dilapidated lath-and-plaster shed, which the simple
country people proudly entitled the Grand Stand.
The races were held early in August, and on the first
and second of the month the outskirts of the common
began to be dotted here and there with covered vans,
and tiny arched tents, beneath whose low roofs a man
could only creep, lying full length upon the bed of fern
and rushes, scattered under the canvas. Tethered horses
munched the dewy grass, and melancholy donkeys wan-
dered disconsolately under the hedges all the live-long
day, cropping the verdant herbage.
Amongst the first of the wanderers who pitched their
tents upon Chilton Common came the very party along
with whom the tramp John Andrews had determined
to keep company. They came after dark, and chose a
sheltered corner far from the carriage-way-a lonely
and forgotten corner, far away from any other settle-
ment, and only telling of its whereabouts by the faint
column of blue smoke that floated upwards from the
gipsies' fire.
"We've many friends as will be here, maybe,” Abra-
ham said, when he and the other men selected the place;
s but we don't want their company. For the sake of
the poor lass here, it's best for us to keep to ourselves.”
The poor lass was the girl they called Britannia.
Once or twice during their travels, John Andrews had
tried, in his uncouth way, to get into conversation with
her, and to worm himself into her confidence; but he

Lady Lisle.
was repulsed by that dark barrier of settled and gloomy
despondency which seemed to separate her from the
rest of the world. I doubt if the gipsy girl even knew
that there was a stranger in the little company. She
spoke to John Andrews when he spoke to her; so far at
least as to answer by a monosyllable some question
which he had, perhaps, repeated three or four times ;
but she never turned her hollow eyes to his face, or
relaxed a muscle of that stony countenance with which
she looked alike on storm or sunshine, joy or sorrow,
friend or foe. When her companions forced food upon
her, she ate-enough to sustain life, and no more. She
only slept from sheer exhaustion, and her slumbers
were agitated by cruel dreams, which shook her with
convulsive agonies. The night they pitched their tents
at the end of their journey, John Andrews, for the
second time, asked the secret of Britannia's despair.
“You said as how you'd tell me when we'd been
longer together," he said to Abraham, “and we have
been a good spell longer together since then; so I sup-
pose you can tell me now.”
“I will,” cried the gipsy, with fierce energy. “Some-
times I like to tell it; sometimes it seems to do me
good to tell it; sometimes I fancy that telling it is half
way to being revenged upon them as did it. I will tell
you, John Andrews.”
The two men were lying on the ground, smoking
their pipes, a little way apart from the other gipsies.
Abraham rose as he spoke, and led the way to
the end of a narrow lane, about a hundred yards
from the tents, where there was a rustic stile. He
seated himself upon the upper part of this stile, and
motioned to Andrews to sit upon the lower step. The
tramp obeyed, and placing himself with his back to
Abraham, refilled and lighted his pipe, preparatory to
listening comfortably to the gipsy's story.
“Yon lass is rather a bandsome lass, ain't she, mate?”
said Abraham, abruptly; “leastways she was uncommon
handsome before fretting night and day about cruel

things as is past and gone (but not forgotten—the Lord
knows they're not forgotten !) took the colour out of
her cheeks, and the light out of her eyes. She was a
handsome girl once.”
“I dare say she was," said John Andrews, rather im-
patiently. “Get on."
“She's no more like one as is lost and gone from us,”
cried the gipsy, with a sudden vehemence," than the
flowers that grows wild upon such commons as this aro
like them as is nursed, and reared, and tended day and
night in the hothouses of your fine gentry. She's no
more like her murdered sister than that lantern down
by the tent yonder is like the star that's coming out,
big and bright, in the sky opposite us. Poor girl! poor
murdered lass!”
6 Murdered!”
“Why, look you, mate; there's murders as are never
done with either a knife or a bullet, and is never tried
at any earthly assizes ; there's some murders in which
it's the soul that's killed, and not the body; and her
murder was such as those.”
“I don't know what you're drivin'at," said the tramp,
sulkily. “I wish you'd cut it a little shorter, and come
to the rights of the story.”
“I will,” answered Abraham ; “but, man alive, give
me time. There are some words as seems like knives,
and cuts into the flesh of your very heart as you say
’em one by one; a separate stab for every syllable. I'll
get on presently. This is the rights of the story," he
cried fiercely. “Somewhere about these parts there
lives a fine gentleman—a gentleman, God help him! If
fine clothes and a great fortune could make a gentleman,
he'd be one; and if a bitter, black, treacherous, and
cowardly heart can make a scoundrel, he is one. How-
Boever, he's a great man in these parts, and last year he
drove his coach and four to the races, with his hand-
some lady sitting inside, and champagne spilling about
like water, and he and his friends betting upon every
horse as run."

Lady Lisle.
John Andrews had listened very intently to every
word of this, and when Abraham stopped for a moment,
the tramp cried out impatiently, “Go on, can't you,
mate? Go on,”
“I'm a-goin' on," answered the other. “ Susannah,
as is dead and gone, own and only sister to Britannia
there, she was at these here last year's races; she was
about all the carriages, a-telling of the ladies and gents
their fortunes, and got a deal of money before the day
was over. His lady noticed her among the rest, and
gave her a golden sovereign for telling of her fortune,
and talked to her a good bit, kind-like and sweet-spoken,
but very proud and high. And he noticed her too, not
free and open, like the other gentlemen, telling her out
loud that she was prettier than any of the fine ladies on
the course, and that she deserved to get a good husband
he didn't notice her like that, but he crept up to her,
sly and sneaking, and some of our men heard him talk-
ing to her, and telling of her that she ought to have a
fine house of her own, and ride in her carriage, instead
of tramping it upon foot, and that she might if she
would listen to those as wished her well. She turned
away from him, indignant like; but go where she would
all that day and the next, he crept after her everywhere,
till she took at last to standing close agen his own car-
riage, within sight of his handsome wife, for she knew
he wouldn't dare speak a word to her there.
“Well, when the races was over, we found we had
done pretty well, for we made a common purse of it,
neither Susannah nor Britannia ever keeping so much
as a sixpence of their earnings, though they got more
than any of us; so we stayed a day or two, resting our-
selves a bit, and getting ourselves in good order for a
long tramp, as we had to go when we started. Would
you believe it, mate, that in those two or three days,
that scoundrel was hanging about our tents after dark
every night, trying to get to talk to Susannah ?”
“And she wouldn't have anything to say to him ? "
muttered John Andrews.

“No!” roared the gipsy, “not she, bless her poor
innocent heart! There's many a lass would have been
pleased with such notice from a fine gentleman like him.
There's many a lass as would have felt it hard to have
to refuse his fine offers of jewellery and sums of money,
such as she'd never even dreamt of before. There's
many a farmer's daughter as would have led him on
with pretty airs and graces, and would have took his
presents, and kept him about her, and showed him off
to her friends, and been proud like of her power over
him, even if she'd turned him off at last. But not a
gipsy-not a gipsy! I think I see her now, as she
came back to the tents one night, after he'd been speak-
ing to her, her beautiful eyes all of a flame, her face
pale, and her teeth set, and she all of a tremble with
passion. I think we've seen the last of him,' she said ;
I don't think he'll come up here again after what I've
said to him to-night.' Heaven help her poor lass! If
that had been the last of him, she might have been
with us still. We was a poor set of fools; for when
she said she'd told him that as would keep him from
following her again, we believed it, and we thought,
because we saw nothing of him the next night, that
he'd give it up for a bad job, and we should hear no
more of him.”
“But you did ?"
“We did,” cried Abraham, shaking his clenched fist,
“ we did! We didn't know what a villain and a cow-
ard can be capable of, when he's thwarted in something
that he's set his mind on. The last day as we were
to stop in these parts, Susannah asked leave to take a
few shillings from the common stock to buy some
little bit of finery to set off her handsome face. It
would have been hard to refuse it to one as had done
so much to earn it, so we gave her free leave to take
what she liked, and she took about five shillings, and
started off to walk to Chilton at three o'clock in the
afternoon; me and Britannia promising to meet her on
the road as she came home. Lord knows how it was ;

but I suppose it was to be. I was particular drowsy
that day, for the weather was hot and close, and I went
off into a sleep that lasted till Britannia came and
waked me, frightened like, telling me that it was
an hour over the time that Susannah had promised to
be back, and there was no signs of her within sight
yet. I was heavy and stupid after my long sleep, and
didn't take much notice of this ; but I said I'd go along
with her, and no doubt we should meet the lass nigh
at hand.
“You know the road from here to Chilton, mate, so
I needn't tell you that it's a lonely road, and that
there's a deep ditch runs along one side of it. It was
down this road as me and Britannia went to look for
her sister just as it was beginning to get dusk.
6 We didn't find her, and we walked into Chilton,
and we heard of her there, and we heard of her start-
ing to walk home four hours before, they said as saw
her leave. I tell you, comrade, that when anything
very awful's a-goin' to happen to you, all your senses
is sharpened like, and the least hint tells you all. I
knew, directly I heard this, that something had hap-
pened to the lass. I didn't say anything to Britannia,
and she didn't say anything to me; but I could see by
her looks that she was as sick and dizzy as I was with
the thought of something wrong.
“It was nigh upon dusk by this time, so I borrowed
a lantern; not to show me and Brittania the way home,
for we knew it well enough, and could have found it
easy if it had been twice as dark as it was ; but I
wanted a lantern, and when I asked for it, I see that
she guessed what I was going to do.
“ As soon as we got quite clear out of the town, and
began to get to the lonely part of the road, I stopped,
and spoke to the lass. She had been walking beside
me, calm and quiet, only as white as a corpse.
66 Britannia, my girl,' I said, 'well have a look
under this here hedge as we go along; Susannah may
have felt tired, and fell asleep somewheres.' Lord help

us! the words choked me as I said 'em, for I knew
what was in my mind and in hers all the time, though
we tried hard to keep it from each other. You know,
mate, as how the ditch only runs along one side of the
road, on the other it's open country; it was on the
side where the ditch was that we looked, me carrying
the lantern, holding it low down to the stagnant water,
and Britannia walking beside me, and looking over my
shoulder.”
“Well ?” cried John Andrews eagerly, as the gipsy
came to a dead pause.
“Well, it was about as I thought," answered the
other; “ half way between the town and the common,
where the road was most lonesome, we found her
lying in the shallow water, cold and dead. There was
footmarks upon the bit of grass alongside of the ditch
a woman's and a man's, and there was the marks of
horses' hoofs upon the road. The grass was trodden
down as if there'd been a struggle, and a broken
riding-whip lay among the weeds hard by. I've kept
that whip ever since, and it was his. I knew it by the
gold handle, shaped the same as his crest.
" Britannia was like a mad woman. She wanted to
go to his house there and then, though it was many
miles from Chilton, and accuse him, before all his house-
hold, of her sister's murder; but I told her that warn't
no good, and I sent her on to fetch one of the men,
and me and him carried the poor girl as was dead back
to the tents, and laid her there, as still as if she had
died peaceful in her bed, with all her friends about her.
" The next day I went to his house, with the broken
riding-whip in my pocket. Well, I see him, and I see
a friend of his, older than him, and with a deal more
to say for himself, and when I told my story and
showed him the whip, the two of 'em laughed in my face,
and his friend said it was a shallow attempt to extort
money. I had the thought of that poor girl's dead
face in my mind all the time, and when I see them
cool and insolent, telling me they knew nothing about it,

and that I must have picked up the whip on the race.
day, as it was on that day it was lost, why I turned
mad like, and I flew at him, and half-strangled him
before his friend and his servants could drag us asunder.
Lord, I wish now that I had held on till they tore me limb
from limb, before I had let go of him. But they had
the best of it; for they had me up before a magistrate
for an assault, and I got three months in gaol for my
day's work. But we shall meet again this race-time,
and I'll set a mark upon him this time as he shall
carry to his grave; and not carry long neither.”
“You haven't told me his name,” said John Andrews.
“Never mind his name,” muttered the gipsy.
“But I do mind his name," answered the other, with
a strange eagerness; “and if you won't tell it me, I'll
tell it you.”
“You !” exclaimed Abraham; “how should you know
it?"
“His name is Sir Rupert Lisle," answered Andrews;
" and he lives at Lislewood Park, about nine miles
from here, and the friend as you see along with him
was a stout chap in a yellow waistcoat, with yellow
chains and lockets hanging all about it, and with
yellow moustaches over his wicked mouth, and his
name is Granville Varney, and he's the biggest villain
as walks this sinful earth !” cried John Andrews, his
voice rising with every word, until it ended in a savage
scream. Curse him ! curse him! curse him!” he
shrieked, brandishing his awkward arms above his
head,
“Vi hy, mate!” cried Abraham aghast, for his own
rage had been as nothing to the fury of this strange
man-“mate, what does this mean?”
“It means that you and me are friends and brothers
from this out,” said the other, “and that lass in there is
my sister ; for we're all working for the same end. And
as to the other one,” cried John Andrews, speaking more
to himself than to the gipsy-“as to the other one, if the
young hound was under my foot, to-night, I'd grind my

iron heel upon his lying mouth, and trample him out of
life, as I would his master. Lord knows, I haven't had
much from him, and don't let him look to be spared by
me, when my turn comes, that's all !”
When the two men returned to the tents, John An-
drews walked straight up to the spot where Britannia
was seated, and kissed her on the forehead. It has been
said that the tramp was by no means a fascinating
person, and even in her abstraction the gipsy girl started
indignantly at this familiarity.
“He's got a grudge against them as you know of,
lass,” said Abraham ; “and he'd scarcely mind being
the death of 'em, I think, by the way he went on just
now.”
“Wouldn't he?” cried the girl, holding up her
parched lips; "kiss me, then-kiss me ; for we're fast.
friends!”
CHAPTER XXXIV.
CHILTON RACES.
The race-going population in the neighbourhood of
Chilton opened their eyes upon bright sunshine on the
morning of the sixth of August. A sky as blue and
cloudless as the heavens that look down on an Italian
harvest stretched itself out in an azure canopy over
Chilton Common. Some gloomy spirits, vexed at the
general joy, murmured that the day was much too fine
to last, and that there would very likely be a storm
before night; but the more cheerful pleasure-seekers
defied these evil auguries, and, pointing to the white and
dusty road, the sunlit streams and glowing sky, asked if
those looked like rain.
· There certainly was a great deal of dust upon the
roads leading to Chilton Common ; but what would the
road between Epsom and London be, when the Derby
Stakes have been lost and won, but for a little dust

to give it a relish? So the Sussex farmers drove their
gigs and dog-carts gaily through white clouds that rose
beneath the trampling hoofs of their stout cobs, and
farmers' wives resigned themselves even to the spoiling
of smart bonnets bought on purpose for the races.
The first race was run at one o'clock, and at exactly
five minutes after one, as the number of the winner went
up, and farmers who had lost and farmers who had won
opened their fat leather pocket-books and exchanged
their moneys in the sacred precincts of the narrow pen
below the stand, popularly called the ring, Sir Rupert
Lisle's drag dashed on to the course, with Major Varney
as charioteer, and the Baronet seated beside him, while,
at one of the windows of the vehicle, beautiful, haughty,
and defiant, appeared the dark face of Olivia Lisle. She
always made a point of showing herself at these public
places; it was as much as to say, “Who says I lead a
wretched life with my husband? Who says I have sold
myself for wealth that cannot give me happiness, and
for a title which I carry as a burden and a disgrace ?
Look at me, and see how prouilly I bear the position
my husband cannot support!” Two of her sisters were
seated with her in the Baronet's mail-coach, their pale
faces and light hair helping to set off the glowing and
dusky beauty of Olivia. They had been created to be
foils to her, and they knew it, and hated her because it
was so. Their insipid manners, their boarding-school
graces, only made her bright vivacity appear more
charming. Perhaps it was a comfort to them to think
that, with all her advantages, she was not happy. They
could at least derive some poor consolation from watch-
ing the feverish lustre in her restless eyes, the nervous
compression of her lips, the perpetual desire for society
that carried her away from her home, and, if possible,
out of herself. The men flocked round her carriage
directly it appeared upon the race-course. She could
talk and laugh more gaily than the gayest there. Tho

greatest holiday of the year, and who had not a care

beyond the dairy or the pigstye, could scarcely be more
radiant, or seem more happy. Some officers from
Brighton Barracks had ridden over to Chilton Common
- dashing dragoons, who ran right and left to find some
one to introduce them to Lady Lisle, and who asked
afterwards if that cad upon the box beside Varney, of
the H.E.I.C.S., was really Sir Rupert.
The gipsies were in full force; brown faces, framed
by bright blue and yellow bonnets, hovered about every
carriage on the course. There were children too, pretty
gipsy children, with big black eyes and crispy hair, for
whom the women begged alms and refreshment from
good-natured pic-nic parties, asking now the claw of a
lobster, now a handful of sandwiches, a silver sixpence,
or a mug of champagne; easier to be got than a draught
of cold water upon Chilton race-course.
Abraham and the other men hung about the carriages,
ready to hold a horse, or to brush the dust off a gentle-
man's coat, or to do anything to pick up a few sixpences.
Strange to say, the tramp, John Andrews, refused to
join the group, or to show himself upon the race-course
at all.
“I've got my reasons,” he said, “and they're good
’uns, so let that satisfy you. I'll work at the mats, or
I'll do anything as you like to put me to in the tents,
but I won't go outside of 'em while the races is going
for'ard."
He kept his word, lying asleep half the day in the
solitary nook where the gipsies had pitched their tent.
Amongst the dusky tribe Britannia wandered, looking
strangely wan and ghastly, in a battered bonnet loaded
with artificial flowers and gaudy trumpery of lace and
ribbons. The faded dust-begrimed bonnet had been
bright and fresh the year before, and the girl had worn
it proudly; but the gipsy's love of finery had been ex-
tinguished by the one absorbing passion which possessed
her like a consuming fever. To-day it seemed as if a
strange fascination held her to the neighbourhood of
Sir Rupert's carriage. If she left the spot for a few

minutes, and attempted to exercise her craft in another
part of the course, she seemed to be led back to the
vicinity of the Baronet's equipage by some irresistible
impulse, that brought her to that spot against her will.
Olivia recognized her, and called her to the carriage
window.
“You were here last year,” she said.
" Yes, lady.'
“But you are changed since then. Have you been
ill?"
“Yes, lady."
** You have been very ill, I fear?”.
“I have, lady. Ill in mind more than in body. I've
wasted and wasted day by day, burning up my very
flesh with fever and anguish; and it was only this
morning, when I put on a gownd as I hadn't worn for
a twelvemonth, that I knew how much I had changed.”
"Poor thing! this is very sad. But where is your
sister-your handsome sister, that was so like you."
“Only handsomer, lady,” interrupted the gipsy.
“Yes, she was very beautiful; one of the handsomest
women I ever saw. You remember her, Laura ?” added
Lady Lisle, turning to her eldest sister. Miss Marma-
duke shrugged her shoulders ; she did not trouble her-
self to remember handsome gipsy girls.
“But why is your sister not here this year, my good
girl?” Olivia asked presently.
“Because she's dead, lady,” cried the gipsy, clench-
ing her teeth, while her dusky cheeks changed to a
greyish white.
"Dead !”
“Yes, lady, dead! Drowned in a ditch; not much
above a mile from this place.”
There was something in the gipsy girl's face, some
strange and ominous meaning in her voice, that made
Olivia's heart sink with a vague terror.
“Did she drown herself, poor girl?” she asked, Al-
most as pale as the gipsy.
“No, lady."

“No! Who, then-How did it happen? Tell me."
“God knows who did it, lady, and we know only too
! well; but the world will never know, for it's a cruel
and a false world, and men's ears are deaf to the sins of
a fine gentleman.”
“I am very sorry to hear this,” said Olivia, slipping
r sovereign into the woman's hand. “I can scarcely
tell you how sorry.”
She said this to the gipsy girl with perfect sincerity: 1
she was grave and thoughtful for the rest of the day, so
much so that the heavy dragoons from Brighton went
about whispering to each other that that superb crea-
ture, Lady Lisle, looked unhappy, and that very likely
the cad ill-used her. After which they consoled them.
selves by staring superciliously at Sir Rupert through
eye-glasses that drew their faces all awry, and rejoicing
among themselves when he insisted upon being guided
by his own judgment, and invariably put his money
upon the worst screw on the course.
“Poor girl!” said Olivia to her sisters; “poor girl!
she was such a beautiful creature, full of life and viva-
city, only last year, and to think that she should have
met with such a cruel fate. Through some villain, too.
Why, good heavens, what a hideous earth it is! it seems
only peopled with wretches!”
Later in the day, as they were preparing for the last
race, Britannia the gipsy approached the carriage as
Sir Rupert himself stood by the door, leaning with his
elbow upon the cushions-not talking to his wife, or
even looking at her, for he scarcely dared to do either-
but taking up his stand by her side, and claiming his
proprietorship in her, as it were, before the face of an
admiring crowd.
He turned white as the gipsy girl came up to him.
He had not seen her before during that day, and he
felt himself doubly weak, inasmuch as Major Varney
was out of the way, fraternizing with the officers
from Brighton, who were some of them known to
him.

Lady Lisle.
“Shall I tell you your fortune, my pretty gentle-
man ?" she asked, looking the young Baronet full in
the face.
"No."
“Not if the gipsy could tell you all manner of strange
things ?” she said, significantly; "not if she could tell
you what is past as well as what is to come, eh, sir ?
Wickedness past and the gallows to come,
For murder will out, though men were dumb.""
6. What's that?" cried Sir Rupert savagely.
“A little bit of rhyme, that's all, my pretty gentle-
man. Lord, we gipsy-folk know a lot of such-like. Let
me tell you your fortune.”
“No," said the Baronet, “I tell you, no! Can't you
take an answer when you get one ? I suppose it's
money you want; money for idle talk and foolery, such
as only fools care for. Take it, then, and go about
your business.”
He took a sovereign from his pocket, and held it out
in the palm of his gloved hand. The gipsy girl flew at
him like a young tigress, struck the money from his
open palm, and spat upon the glittering coin as it lay
on the ground at her feet.
“That's how I treat the gold of such as you !" she
screamed.
The people stared aghast at this strange scene, and
indeed it was a scene eminently calculated to arouse
popular curiosity. The gipsy woman was beside her-
self with passion; the Baronet grew red and pale by
turns, and trembled with cowardly rage; while Lady
Lisle's dark face looked out of the carriage window
with a stony calmness.
“ Curtis, cried Sir Rupert to one of his grooms,
who was busy packing some hampers, “ Curtis, get me
a policeman ; I will give this woman in charge.”
The groom ran across to the other side of the conrse,
where he saw the glimmer of a policeman's oilskin.

not seem to have even heard the order given by Sir
Rupert to his servant. She stood still and rigid, with
her eyes fixed upon the ground.
“What are you going to do, Sir Rupert Lisle ?"
asked Olivia, looking full at her husband.
“ To give this woman in charge.”
“For what?”
“For having assaulted me." He answered in his old
sulky manner, still turning from red to pale, and from
pale to red.
“I know this woman,” said Lady Lisle quietly," and
I knew her sister. I have heard the history of the
girl's death. You will not give the gipsy in charge, Sir
Rupert."
«Why not?"
“Because I forbid you to do so, and because I know
the share you had in "
“Let her go, then!” cried Sir Rupert suddenly
“Curtis, tell the policeman he's not wanted. My wife
is so very soft-hearted that she'd rather see her husband
insulted than let him take his own part. Go about
your business," he added, turning fiercely upon the
gipsy girl, “and let me hear no more of yon, nor of
your sister, nor any of your beggarly lot-do you
hear?”
“I do,” answered the girl, "and there are others that
bear too."
She went away; but after walking a few paces, re.
turned, and going close to the Baronet, said to him, in
a voice that was hardly above a whisper, “ Sir Rupert
Lisle, are you never frightened? Do you never, in the
dark still night, wake suddenly with a cold sweat upon
your forehead, and a stiff stark drowned face staring
at you out of the shadows round your bed ? I do. I
see that face often, in darkness and in sunshine; and if
it's terrible to me, what must it be to you ?”

CHAPTER XXXV.
IN THE MOONLIGHT.
MAJOR GRANVILLE VARNEY and the officers from Brighton,
Barracks grew very friendly by the time the races were
over. So friendly indeed did they become under the
influence of such effervescent drinks as champagne,
sparkling Moselle, and Burgundy, to say nothing of
the waters of Vichy and Seltzer duly modified by the
rarest old cognac, that when the last race had been run,
when the winner had been disposed of to some happy
and spirited speculator, whose bids came from the
neighbourhood of the auctioneer's elbow, and who was
not forthcoming to claim his purchase, when the pro-
prietors of the canvas booths began to light tiny oil-
lamps for the convenience of such country folk as
wished to finish the day's excitement by a dance, wher
stout Sussex farmers Lad had themselves and their
families weighed in the real Jockey-Club scale at a
penny apiece, when the course grew clear without the
efforts of anxious rural policemen, when, in short, the
business of the day was done, and only the loiterers,
who had never had enough of pleasure, lagged behind,
the Brighton officers refused to part with their new
comrade.
“We've ordered dinner for half-past eight o'clock at
the George, at Chilton. Why not join us, Major? We
can drive you over in our drag, and you can easily get
a trap from Chilton to Lislewood."
"I should be delighted,” said the Major, shrugging
his shoulders; “but my friend "
“Bring Sir Rupert Lisle with you," said a dashing
young captain, the chief of the party, and the most
noble-hearted and generous of good fellows, although
his father was a West-end confectioner" bring Sir
Rupert with you: he doesn't look as if he had much to
say for himself; but we'll do what we can to entertain
him."

Captain Hunter and the Major strolled up to the
Baronet's carriage to give the invitation. Sir Rupert
was still pale and crest-fallen from the effects of his en.
counter with the gipsy. The Major's proposition seemed
a relief to him.
“I'll come,” he said eagerly; "anything for a
change. Lislewood Park's dull enough. A man might
as well live in a mausoleum.”
So one of the grooms drove the carriage containing
Olivia Lisle and her sisters back to Lislewood Park,
while Sir Rupert and the Major took their places in the
drag belonging to the officers.. Captain Hunter drove,
and the Major sat beside him on the box.
“We have to get back to Brighton to-night," said the
Captain ; “for we must be on parade to-morrow morn-
ing. Confounded bore, isn't it?"
The Major laughed merrily. “I've seen too much
hard work in the Company's service," he said, “ to be
able to feel any great compassion for you dashing
dragoons.”
"0, but, 'pon honour, now, we do work jolly hard.”
It was dark when they reached Chilton. The princi-
pal apartment at the George was brilliantly illuminated
with clusters of wax candles in plated branches. The
long dinner-table glittered and sparkled with a noble
display of silver and glass; and the landlord was ready,
in a tremendous white waistcoat and a glossy suit of
funereal black, to bring in the soup and bid the gentle-
men welcome. They were very merry-rather noisily
and confusedly so-sometimes almost uproariously so.
Sir Rupert Lisle drank tumbler after tumbler of cham-
pagne, and joined in the mirth every now and then with
a shout of coarse unmeaning laughter, which very much
added to the noise of the assembly, without in the least
increasing any one's hilarity. Once, when the sweets
were placed upon the table, there was some playful
allusion made to that trade from which the captain
inherited his handsome fortune. The joke was not,
perhaps, a very brilliant one; but it came from an old

comrade, and was meant so good-naturedly, that even a
less amiable man than Captain Hunter might have taken
it in good part. Sir Rupert Lisle, encouraged by this,
tried to cut his own clumsy witticism upon the same
subject; but he was checked by such a frown from
Major Varney, that he stopped in the midst of his speech,
and was silent for some time afterwards. But as the
night advanced he grew noisy again, and made himself
altogether such a nuisance to the joyous little party,
that Major Varney by-and-by rose from his seat and
took the Baronet by the collar of his coat, and led him
into an adjoining apartment, where he told him to lie
down and go to sleep.
“You are no more fit for society than those who
reared you,” he said to the white-faced besotted-looking
young man. “Though your own cellars are full of the
finest wine in England, you are such a sot by nature,
that you can't see a few bottles of champagne without
getting drunk. Lie down, and sleep off your intoxi.
cation. Lie down!”
It is very seldom the lot of a gentleman, whose name
is inscribed in the Baronetage, and whose estate is one
of the finest in the county in which he lives, to be spoken
to in such a manner as this ; but Sir Rupert obeyed as
quietly as if he had been some ill-conditioned cur, and
the Major his master.
The harmony of the evening was certainly consider-
ably increased by this proceeding on the part of Major
Varney. The officers gathered round the open windows
of the apartment, and looked out upon the moonlit market
town of Chilton as they smoked their cigars. It had
struck eleven from a grey old church-tower on the other
side of the market-place. The streets were deserted ; a
solitary policeman hung about the pavement on the op-
posite side of the way, with an ear, perhaps, to the noisy,
party at the George, and with an eye to divers half-
crowns to be obtained therefrom before the night was
out. It was past one before the last champagne-bottlo
rolled a dead man under the table, and the four prancing

bays stood pawing the pavement of Chilton High-street,
before the front door of the George.
“We shall have a glorious drive to Brighton," said
Captain Hunter. “Shan't we fly across the moonlit
downs, and dash clattering into Lewes, at about four
o'clock this morning?”
The landlord of the George had provided a neat little
dog-cart, with a fast brown mare, to carry the Major
and Sir Rupert back to Lislewood.
“Give her her head," he said, as he brought the
vehicle up to the door; “give her her head, sir, and let
her go her own pace, without so much as taking the
whip out of the socket, and she'll have you at Lisle-
wood Park before you know where you are.”
The Baronet had to be shaken, shouted at, and pulled
half off the sofa, before he could be aroused from the
sleep into which he had fallen. When at last he did
open his eyes, it was only to look vacantly about him,
and to ask, with an oath, where he was. Major Varney
waited for no explanations, but taking the Baronet by
Che collar in the same manner as before, he led him
stumbling down the staircase, and half lifted, half
pushed him into the dog-cart.
There was a great deal of shaking of hands between
the Major and the cavalry officers, and some consider-
able noise and clamour as the young men mounted to
the roof of the vehicle-only one boyish ensign, for
whom the wine had been too much, riding inside. The
watchful policeman crossed the road to remonstrate
concerning this disturbance to the peace of Chilton;
but, subdued by the expected half-crowns, the worthy
functionary grew suddenly deaf-so deaf, indeed, that
he had nothing to say when one of the officers pro-
duced a comet-à-piston, and the drag drove off to the
accompaniment of the Post-horn Galop, played at the
loudest power of the instrument.
Major Granville Varney was, as our readers must
have discovered, of an eminently social disposition; and
when he heard the drag rumbling and rattling away

through the High-street, with the hearty voices of the
young men sounding above the noise of the wheels, he
experienced a vague feeling of distaste for his own
lonely drive.
“I might have driven to Brighton with them, and
slept at the Old Ship,” he thought; “but then what
could I have done with this cluinsy drunken ill-con-
ditioned lout?” So the Major shook the reins, and
gave the brown mare her head, and they were soon far
away upon a lonely cross road, that took them on their
way to Lislewood. “It's a dreary drive, even by day-
light," muttered Major Varney, “all through lanes and
cross roads, and over a dismal common. I hope the
mare's safe for such a road."
Sir Rupert fell asleep, bumping heavily against the
Major's shoulder at every jolt of the light vehicle.
"I'm beginning to get tired of this,” thought the
Indian Officer, abandoning himself to serious medita-
tion; “it isn't a pleasant thing to pass one's life af
leader and trainer to such an ill-conditioned animal as
this. I've made a good purse-enough to keep me in
luxury for the rest of my life and I've got that in my
possession which gives me such a claim upon this mean.
spirited cur as makes him my slave for life. I shall put
my affairs into good order, and leave England with
Mrs. Granville Varney. We can establish ourselves at
Florence, and pass the rest of our days in peace. We're
both getting middle-aged, and stout, and lazy. We want
repose. Life has not been an idle one with us. We
have done a little good in our way, and a little mischief
in our way; but we have never committed a punishable
offence, or put it into the power of that strange incar-
nation, the Law, to say, 'I've a hold upon that man.'
It is a pleasant thing, at the close of a busy life," mur.
mured the Major, almost piously, “to be able to say
this.”
Major Varney was not a drinking man, and he was,
furthermore, a man who, by reason of his iron nerves
and unimpaired constitution, could drink a great dea]

288
without being in the least affected by it. The few glasses
of wine he had taken at the George had seemed to give
his mind a more than usually active tone, and he drove
on, full of serious but not unpleasant reflections. If
Granville Varney had ever had a conscience, he had
strangled that unpleasant mentor at so very early a
period of his existence, that he had no recollection of
that remote time when its still small voice had pos-
sessed the power to perplex him with tiresome remon-
strances.
“The beauty, or, I may almost say, the symmetry of
my life,” said the Major, “has resulted chiefly from one
thing, namely, my careful study of the law. Man, on
entering upon the world, with the great oyster firmly
closed against him, and with nothing but the sword of
intellect with which to open it-man, the adventurer
and soldier of fortune, finds himself face to face with
one great enemy—the law. If he cheats at cards, the
law has him; if he gets into debt, the law is down upon
him; if he marries a second wife, the first still surviv-
ing, the law says, 'No, you don't!' If he owes money
to a man, or expects to inherit money from a man, and
that man happens to die rather suddenly, the law wants
to know all about it. Life is a drawn battle between the
adventurer and the law; and it is only by finding out
the weak points of his enemy that man has any chance
of becoming victor. But the enemy has its weak points.
Yes,” said the Major, shaking his reins gaily, “the law
has its weak points, and I have made them my especial
study. The law punishes the tool, and not the workman
who employs the tool. The law is fond of a scapegoat;
and you have but to throw the meaner villain into the
Old Bailey dock, and blind stupid pig-headed and self.
satisfied criminal law pounces upon its pitiful victim;
while the master-scoundrel looks on from the ranks of
the spectators, and laughs at the sacrifice."
With such pleasing reflections as these Major Varney
beguiled his lonely drive in the moonlit lanes between
Chilton and Lislewood, while his companion bumped

from side to side of the little vehicle in a stupid drunken
sleep.
Throughout the county of Sussex there is not, per-
haps, an uglier bit of road than one dreary mile between
Chilton and Lislewood. This ugly bit of road lies across
a steep hill, over which there is a winding rugged car-
riage-way, scarcely wide enough for one vehicle, bor-
dered on one side by a bit of craggy moor, and on the
other by a gravel-pit shelving abruptly down from the
very edge of the road. A less experienced charioteer than
Major Varney would have run no little risk of driving
over this sharp edge in the uncertain moonlight; but
the Indian officer had been used to rough roads, and
drove quietly up the steep ascent with a light hand and
a wary eye to the narrowness of the way along which
the brown mare was creeping. Towards the summit of
the hill there was a group of straggling bushes that had
grown up since the gravel had been dug out years before.
These bushes stood ont black and distinct against the
moonlight, and close beside them the Major fancied he
saw the sharp outline of a man's figure. He was not
mistaken. When he reached the top of the ascent the
man quietly advanced, and laid his hand upon the
horse's head.
“Can you give me and my mate a lift, master ?” he
asked.
."No," said the Major, “I can't, my man. I have ten
miles to go, and my load's heavy enough as it is. Let
go of the mare's head, will you ?”
“No, I won't, master. You might speak a bit more
civil, I think. It's quite as well I came up with you.
Don't you know as your trace is broken ?”
"No."
“ It is though. Get out and look.”
The man was perfectly right. The Major dismounted,
and examining the trace in the spot pointed to by the
man, found that the leather had become worn and
rotten just where the buckle fastened it, and had
dropped asunder.

“This is awkward,” said the Major. “Have you got
a bit of rope about you?”
“Not a inch,” answered the man; “but there's a cot-
tage just below the hill yonder; if you go down there,
maybe they'll give you what you want.”
“Good. Sir Rupert, get down, will you ?"
But the Baronet was deaf to any such appeal. He
had slid from the seat to the floor of the vehicle, and
lay coiled up in a heap upon the rug.
“ Look ye here," said the man; “ they don't know
you down at yon cottage, and maybe you might stand
knocking there till daylight before they'd answer you;
but they know me, and they'll do anything as I ask 'em.
I tell you what I'll do for you. I'll walk your horse
down the hill, call the folks up and get the trace mended,
and you can wait up here till I give you a shout."
At any other time the Major might have felt some
slight suspicion as to the motives of this man's civility,
but he was tired and sleepy, and had just then no par-
ticular fancy for leading the horse and vehicle down the
crumbling bit of shelving roadway. He therefore ac-
cepted the man's offer with a yawn, telling him to look
sharp, and he'd get a half-crown for his trouble.
Left alone upon the little height, he stood with the
cluster of bushes behind him, and the silvery moorland
stretched before. He looked at his watch, for the moon.
light was bright enough for him to see the hands. It
was twenty minutes past three.
“We've lost no time,” he muttered, “ between Chil-
ton and this. We shall be at Lislewood by half-past
four."
He took out his cigar-case and lighted a cheroot. He
was pulling stoutly at the red spark that alternately
glowed and faded in the cool night air, when he was
startled by a fiorce hurried breathing at his side. He
turned sharply round, and found himself face to face
with a man-a big broad-shouldered awkward-looking
fellow, dressed in a countryman's smock-frock.
“Who are you, and what do you want?” cried the

Major between his teeth, without taking the cigar from
his mouth.
The man made no reply. The sudden appearance
of this man in so solitary a spot and at so strange an
hour, joined to his ominous silence, would have chilled
the innermost heart of a coward; but the Major's
indomitable spirit only rose in the danger of the
·moment.
“Who are you?” he cried, throwing away his cigar,
and putting his hand upon his massive watch-chain.
“Who are you? You'd better speak, unless you want
me to throw you into that gravel-pit.”
Take care I don't throw you into that gravel-
pit," said the man suddenly, in a hoarse discordant
voice, not unfamiliar to the Major. “I don't want your
watch," he cried scornfully. "I might have taken that
from you four years ago, if I'd had the chance; but
not now, not now! I've come back all the way from
America to get my revenge, and I mean to have it!
It's you I want, body and soul —your sleek over-fed
body, and your bitter black soul! Come on. It's my
life against yours!”
The man twisted his coarse muscular hands in the
Major's loose cravat; but not before the Major had
caught him by the collar of his smock-frock. Linked
together so, the two men wrestled upon the narrow
pathway, swaying backwards and forwards; now drag-
ging each other to the brink of the precipice, now with
à mighty effort reeling away from it, only to be dragged
back to it again. Throughout this struggle the Major
was quiet and self-possessed, wrestling with the calm
prudence of a professional pugilist, always on his guard,
and ready to snatch every advantage. The other man,
on the contrary, was possessed by a loud fury which
was almost madness. His hot breath came in gasps-
he was like a creature convulsed by some demon-he
seemed a very wild beast, only more horrible than any
savage beast in his semblance to the humanity which he
disgraced.

“I told you," he shrieked, “I told you to look out,
if ever I came back from the place you sent me to. I
told you to beware, and I told you true. I've come
back. I've come back through toil, and trouble, and
starvation. I've come back for the one end of my
wicked life. I've come back to murder you, and I'll
do it!”
The words rose in a shrill clamour on the quiet
atmosphere. Neither far nor near about the moonlit
country side was there a creature to hear the outcry, or
to interfere between the two men.
“ All the money your wickedness has ever earned
wouldn't bribe me,” gasped the Major's opponent. “All
the jewels you ever wore scattered at my feet wouldn't
save you from one blow. I hate you! I hate you, and
I've come here to murder you! do you understand ?"
Still the Major did not answer. His white and deli-
cate hands were twisted in the collar of the man's loose
garment, and his bright blue eyes were dilated with a
fierce stare ; but he did not utter a word; he only held
his ground, calm with a desperate calmness, and with
his eyes always fixed on the eyes of his adversary. He
knew the full extent of his danger-he knew that he
was face to face with death. The man was enraged by
his silence and his calmness.
“You know me,” he gasped, “ you know me, and
know what good cause I have to hate you. You used
me, did you, to work your ends for you? You made a
tool of me, and laughed at me when you'd done; and
kicked me off as if I'd been an old boot worn out and
done for. You found out a secret about me, and you.
held it over my head. You found out how I shot a
man near Sevenoaks, a man as crossed me, and a man ,
as I hated, but not one-hundredth part as I hate you.
Do you hear ?"
“I do,” said the Major quietly.
Science and coolness of temper had got the best of
the struggle; the Indian officer stretched Gilbert Arnold
apon the pathway, and set his knee upon the man's

chest. But the poacher had come prepared for the
worst. As his foe bent over him, the flashing blue eyes
fixed upon his purpling face, one slender hand twisted
in his bird's-eye neckbandkerchief, Gilbert Arnold, by a
powerful effort, contrived with his disengaged hand to
draw an awkward rusty pistol from his trousers-pocket.
Before Major Varney could be aware of this movement
the poacher had pulled the trigger, and fired the.
charge straight into the face of his foe. The Indian
officer rolled over his murderer in a ghastly heap, ex-
piring without a groan. Gilbert Arnold disengaged
himself from the dead man, and after looking cautiously
about him, knelt by the side of the body, and began to
ransack the pockets of his victim. He took the Major's
watch, and all those wonderful trinkets of yellow gold
which had been wont to accompany Granville Varney's
footsteps with a faint jingling that was like some kind
of barbarous music. He found a quantity of loose gold
in the waistcoat-pocket, and a leather purse containing
notes. The Major had been fortunate in his specula-
tions on Chilton race-course. The poacher gave a
hoarse laugh as he counted the notes and gold, and
found how profitable his night's work was likely to be :
and then, having stowed away his plunder safely about
his own person, he uttered a savage cry of triumph,
and dragged his victim by the heels to the edge of the
gravel-pit, making a track of blood as he went. Ho
stood for a moment looking round him in the moon-
light, and then hurled the corpse into the hollow.
It rolled slowly down, sometimes stopping in its
course, arrested by the shrubs scattered about the mouth
of the pit, then disengaging itself by its own weight,
and rolling on till it fell with a splash into some stag.

The gipsy Abraham was far away along the road
when this happened. He had taken the dog-cart to the
bottom of the hill, and then, lashing the mare with a
savage violence, had set her galloping madly off, draga

“This night's work will about finish Sir Rupert
Lisle !” he muttered, as he listened to the faint clatter
of the receding wheels. “It seems a poor revenge for
the murder of the lass; but it's something, anyhow !”
CHAPTER XXXVI.
BROUGHT TO AN ACCOUNT.
THE village of Lislewood rang with the news of an
accident which had befallen the master of Lislewood
Park. Early on the morning after the races, a party
of reapers going to their work had found Sir Rupert
Lisle lying, ghastly and blood-bespattered, upon a
lonely bit of road between Chilton and Lislewood.
The shattered ruins of a dog-cart lay huddled in the
ditch by his side, the shafts broken, one of the wheels
off, and the harness cut to pieces.
The men took a hurdle from one of the fields near,
and spread their coats and waistcoats upon it. On this
rough couch they laid the motionless form of the
Baronet, and carried him upwards of three miles to a
village called Underhill, about half-way on the road to
Lislewood, where they bore him straight to the modest
residence of the surgeon.
They found the simple village practitioner seated at
breakfast, from which meal he rose aghast when he saw
the state of the patient the men had brought to him.
A crowd of villagers, with prying scared faces, clus.
tered about the door and window of the little surgery,
as Sir Rupert Lisle was laid along the counter upon
which the surgeon was wont to dispense his drugs and
medicaments.
One of the Baronet's legs was completely shattered
by the violence with which he had been thrown from,
the vehicle ; the ribs on the right side were broken,
and there was a dislocated shoulder.
The surgeon looked very grave as he ascertained

all this. He asked the men if they knew who the
gentleman was? And thereupon there arose a clamour
of Hibernian tongues : “Sure, no, your hannar; and
didn't we find the poor thing lying all alone in the
ditch? And didn't we come upon the poor creetur
unbeknownst, and not able to spake a worrud ?”.
The surgeon shook his head solemnly. He said it
was a very bad case--he might say a desperate case.
All this time Sir Rupert Lisle lay in a dull heavy
swoon, breathing stertorously, and unconscious of any
verdict which might be passed upon his state ; utterly
unconscious of that state itself.
They found a mother-of-pearl and enamel card-case
in his waistcoat-pocket, from which they learned his
name and rank.
The Underhill surgeon was a struggling young man,
who had never had the good fortune to heal the ills of
anybody above a rich farmer, or a retired tradesman.
He turned almost as white as his patient while he
contemplated the possible profit and glory that might
accrue to him from having a real baronet all to himself,
under his own hands, in his own surgery. He was so
flurried at the thought of this happy privilege, that he
was rather puzzled as to how he should best avail him.
self of it.
His first course was to turn sharply round upon the
curious bystanders and drive them about their business.
“Come,” he said, “keep clear of that door and win.
dow, will you! There's no getting a breath of air in
the place while you crowd round like that. Go back
to your work, can't you, and give Sir Rupert Lisle a
chance of coming to himself again !”.
Sir Rupert Lisle! It was Sir Rupert Lisle, then, of
Lislewood Park, who was lying, with a ghastly face,
and dusty blood-stained garments, upon the counter in
Mr. Dawson's surgery.
It is not to be supposed that this piece of informan
tion made the villagers any more willing to disperse;
they only went away very demonstratively for about.

two minutes, to creep quietly back at the end of that
time. But Sir Rupert Lisle showed no inclination what-
ever to awake to any consciousness of his sufferings.
They gave him hartshorn and ammonia, they deluged
his pale face with vinegar and cold water ; but when at
last he opened his blood-shot eyes, it was only to stare
wildly about him for a few moments, and then to close
them again with a convulsive shudder.
After some deliberation, the young surgeon decided
upon what course to pursue. He sent one of the vil-
lagers to the chief inn of the place, with orders to get
the best vehicle that was to be had, and to bring it round
to the surgery immediately
Half a dozen people set off to execute this commis.
sion, while all the rest remained behind to stare at
Sir Rupert Lisle. It is possible the honest rustics
had a notion that Mr. Dawson would set the Baronet's
shattered limb in half an hour or so, and restore him to
health there and then, for their edification.
A great unwieldy broad-shouldered roomy fly,
drawn by a knock-kneed white horse, came rumbling
over the rough pavement of the village street, and
stopped with the noise of a stage-coach at the surgery
door.
Sir Rupert Lisle was lifted on to one of Mr. Dawson's
mattresses, and the mattress laid carefully across the
vehicle, supported by a clever arrangement of broom-
handles and the old worm-eaten cushions. Armed
with some lotions, a sponge, and a bottle of hartshorn,
the surgeon stepped into the fly, after having given
a few brief directions to a very elderly charioteer, and
seated himself by the side of his patient.
Mr. Dawson had decided on carrying the young
· Baronet straight to Lislewood Park, and there placing
him in the hands of his relatives and friends.
Olivia Lisle satat the breakfast-table by the open oriel
window in the library. She was not alone, for Mrs.
Granville Varney lounged in an easy chair on the other
side of the window, yawning over a country paper. To

say that the two women agreed would be, perhaps, to say
too much ; but they never disagreed. Adeline Varney
asked nothing from life but handsome dresses, and
showy jewels, and sumptuous dinners, a carriage to ride
in, and a fine house to shelter her. Give her these, and
she cried quits with Fortune, and became the most
amiable and easy of creatures. Her residence at Lisle-
wood Park secured all these. She felt that the Major
was the real master of the place, and that whatever
advantages the Sussex mansion afforded were as free to
her as to Olivia Lisle.
Neither of the ladies had been at all alarmed by the
protracted absence of the Baronet and his friend. Olivia
took no more interest in her husband's movements than
she would have done in those of some obnoxious cur ;
and Adeline Varney felt so entire a confidence in the
powers of the brilliant Major, that had he been away
for a month, she would have been perfectly happy in the
certainty that he had some good reason for his absence.
So the two ladies lounged over their breakfast. Lady
Lisle sat in a thoughtful attitude, staring vacantly into
the luxuriant flower-garden ; while Mrs. Major Varney
amused herself, now picking at the wing of a pigeon,
now munching a scrap of dry toast, now peeling an
apricot, or cutting a great Guernsey pear into quarters,
and trifling with the delicacies of the table with epicu-
rean relish.
“Do you know, Lady Lisle," said Mrs. Varney, after
watching Olivia lazily for some moments through the
half-shut lids of her sleepy almond-shaped eyes,—“do
you know that I can sometimes fancy a likeness between
you and a man who died in this house."
“You mean Captain Walsingham.”
“Yes, poor Arthur Walsingham, who married your
pretty flaxen-haired mother-in-law, and sat himself
down to finish his life in this splendid prison. There
is a look in your face that I have seen in his a hundred
times—the look of a person who has made a terrible
mistake.”

“ I have made a mistake!” cried Olivia, with a dark
frown. “You know that as well as I. I wonder you
dare speak to me of these things."
Mrs. Granville Varney lifted her black eyebrows with
the prettiest air of innocence.
. “My dear Lady Lisle,” she said, “pray remember
that I know nothing. Whatever secrets my husband
may have, they are secrets of his own, and I am a great
deal too stupid to be trusted with them. I am only
an overgrown child, and as long as Granville makes
my life happy, I care nothing about any little mys-
teries which he may please to hide from me. Ah! my
dear Lady Lisle, how much happier you might be
if you could only accept existence in the same spirit,
But I suppose that sort of thing is a matter of tem.
perament."
Mrs. Varney waited for a reply from her companion,
and, receiving none, shrugged her ample shoulders with
a playful gesture and strolled out of the room, singing
a joyous barcarolle.
Half an hour afterwards Olivia ordered her horse,
and left the Park for a long morning scamper over the
downs.
She passed a lumbering ily crawling slowly along in
the road between Lislewood Park and the downs, but
she was too completely absorbed in her own gloomy
thoughts to notice either the vehicle or its occupant.
It was five o'clock in the afternoon before she re-
entered the gates of Lislewood. The woman at the
lodge looked at her with a set and solemn counte.
nance, full of meaning. She was dying to tell her
mistress of the catastrophe. Her husband came out
of the cottage smoking his pipe, which he removed
hastily from his mouth when he perceived Olivia.
About the garden gate stood two or three of the
villagers, who were on visiting terms at the lodge,
and had crept in to get the first of the news, and
carry it back to Lislewood.
Olivia perceived the strange eagerness in the scared

faces of these people, every one of them dying to tell
her the evil tidings.
“What is the matter?" she said to the lodge-keeper.
“Why are these people here ?”.
This was sufficient to unloose the woman's tongue.
"O, my lady! Poor Sir Rupert! Poor dear gentle
man!—but keep up your heart, my lady, don't give way
now, there's a sweot dear lady. He may get over it yet,
ma'am, they say. The London doctor is with him, and
everything's a-bein' done. So don't give way now, dear,
dear lady?”
Olivia Lisle showed no sign whatever of giving way.
Her face changed to a dusky pallor, her large black
eyes dilated, and when one of the villagers, more offi.
cious than the rest, brought a glass of water from the
lodge and offered it to her with an obsequious air of
compassion, she dashed it from the man's hand with an
angry gesture that sent the glass shivering into atoms
upon the gravel pathway.
“Has anything happened to your master ?” she said
to the woman in sharp clear accents.
"O, but, my lady, it was to be kept from you, and
you must please not to take on "
“Has anything happened, woman? Answer me, will
you, yes or no ?
"Yes, my lady," the woman stammered. “ Sir
Rupert has had a fall out of a carriage, and his life is
nigh give over ; but don't take on now, that's a dear
lady-
Before the woman could finish her consolatory speech
the dear lady had lashed her mare across the shoulders,
and was flying down the avenue leading to the house.
The bystanders looked at each other curiously as the
horse disappeared under the shadow of the beeches.
“How strange she takes it !” murmured the lodge-
keeper, “Quite angry and fierce like, but not a bit
overcome. If it had been me I should have screamed
in the 'sterics till you might have heard me up at the
village,”

295
Her husband nodded his head in confirmation of this
assertion. These very 'sterics were terrible weapons
which his wife held over him on every occasion.
“Some folks does take things different to others," he
said, sententiously; “but,” he added, sinking his voice
almost to a whisper, “I have heerd as how Sir Rupert
and my lady don't lead the pleasantest life together.”
Lady Lisle walked straight to the room adjoining
that in which her husband lay. Two grave doctors;
were whispering together in one of the windows, while ?
Mr. Dawson, the surgeon from Underhill, stood at a
respectful distance, rubbing his hands nervously. ..
Sir Rupert's house-steward had telegraphed both to
London and Brighton for medical assistance, and Mr.
Dawson felt himself completely useless between the
two eminent surgeons, who stared superciliously at
him through their gold double eye-glasses, and gave
little doubtful coughs when he told them his treatment
of the Baronet.
· Pale and self-possessed, with her riding-hat in her
hand and her heavy black hair falling about her
shoulders, Lady Lisle appeared before the three medical
men.
“Sir Rupert is in danger, I hear,” she said quietly;
“ will you be so kind, gentlemen, as to tell me the
extent of that danger ?”
“Madam," murmured one of the doctors blandly,
“medical science will do its very uttermost for Sir
Rupert Lisle. You may depend upon that. If it is
possible for him to be saved, we will save him.”
“But you apprehend a difficulty in saving him ?”
she asked.
They had been prepared for sobs and lamentations,
and her quiet manner almost threw them off their guard.
“We do, madam, a serious difficulty "
She had been very pale before, but as the London
surgeon pronounced these words, which, from the tone
in which they were said, sounded like the Baronet's
death-warrant, her face grew ghastly white, and she

put her hand to her head, as if trying to collect her
senses.
Mr. Dawson rab to her with a chair, thinking that
the shock had overcome her.
“ She is not going to faint,” murmured the Brighton
surgeon, looking reproachfully at Mr. Dawson, who
blushed for his mistake.
“Gentlemen," said Olivia gravely, "you will do your
best for your patient, I know. Whatever medical skill
can effect must be done. If you require other aid, I
implore you to send for the most eminent men in Lon-
don or on the Continent. Let nothing be left undone.
The issue is in the hands of Providence; we can but
await it quietly."
There was something in Lady Lisle's manner so
utterly different from the ordinary conduct of a wife
under such circumstances, that the three doctors looked
at each other simultaneously.
Olivia sank into a chair near the table, and buried
her face in her hands.
She was praying that she might not feel a wicked
joy in the accident which had befallen the master of
Lislewood.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
AT REST.
THERE was one question whispered every now and then
upon the lips of all the servants in the Lislewood house.
hold—Where was Major Granville Varney?
The two men had left the race-course together, and
only one of them had been found upon the lonely road
between Chilton and Lislewood.
If Olivia Lisle was calm and quiet in the midst of
this scene of confusion and calamity, it was not so with
Mrs. Granville Varney. The distracted woman rushed
from room to room, crying out every moment that her

297
husband must be dead, or he would never have aban
doned the Baronet.
It was in vain the terrified servants tried to reassure
her. The Major might have stayed at Chilton; he
might have gone to Brighton, and left Sir Rupert to
drive home alone; there might be a hundred reasons
for his absence.
"Don't talk to me," she cried; “I tell you he is
dead, or he would have returned with that young man.
For pity's sake, some of you go and search the road
between this and Chilton.”
The grooms and stable-boys galloped off at dusk to
seek for the Major, as the servants of Lislewood had
set out years before to look for the lost heir.
Their search was finished before midnight. Looking
to the right and the left, under every hedge and into
every ditch, they had come to the gravel-pit, with its
crumbling hollow and waving crown of bushes. Here,
lying in the stagnant blood-stained water, at the bottom
of the pit, they had found him whom they sought, stark
and ghastly, with his dead face staring up at the moon-
lit sky. Before day break they had carried him back to
Lislewood, and laid him on his own bed—the luxurious
bed in which, for years, he had slept the peaceful sleep
of an innocent man.
His grief-stricken wife sat by his pillow throughout
the next day, weeping and lamenting over him, while
all Sussex rang with the news of his murder, and in
every village street throughout the county men read a
placard, setting forth how one hundred pounds reward
would be given to any one who could furnish informa-
tion that would lead to the apprehension of the mur.
derer.
The coroner's inquest was appointed to take place on
the following morning; but in the meantime the county
magistrates went in and out of the stately Lislewood
mansion all day long, while London detectives took
hasty luncheons in the basement, and interrogated eager
servants, only too glad to be allowed to speak.

Lady Lisle.
When the clothes were removed from the dead man,
those who removed them found a leathern strap and
tiny steel-clasp pocket-book fastened about his waist.
This book was opened by the coroner during the in-
quest.
It contained a half-sheet of foolscap, on which was a
confession, written by Major Varney, signed by James
Arnold, alias Sir Rupert Lisle, and witnessed by Alfred
Salamons.
It was framed in very simple language, and ran th
“I, James Arnold, otherwise Sir Rupert Lisle, do
hereby confess and avow that, at the instigation of my
father, Gilbert Arnold, now, to the best of my belief, in
America, I have represented myself to be Sir Rupert
Lisle, of Lislewood, in the county of Sussex, and by
this fraud bave obtained possession of the afore-men-
tioned Sir Rupert Lisle's estate, being perfectly aware
that the said Sir Rupert is now living in the county
of York. Dated this 10th day of October, 18—,
“JAMES ARNOLD, alias RUPERT LISLE.
“ Witness, ALFRED SALAMONS."
Mr. Alfred Salamons, who was one of the witnesses
at the inquest, bore testimony to his signature. The
bewildered coroner asked him what he knew of the
document.
“Only this, gentlemen," said the Israelite, whose
eyes were red and inflamed with weeping—for the
valet had been sincerely attached to his master—"only
this, gentlemen, my master came by chance upon the
knowledge that this young scoundrel was an impostor.
The Major might have had him up before a court of
justice, and have had the rightful heir restored to Lisle-
wood; but courts of justice are queer places, and pos-
session is nine points of the law, and the rightful heir
was not forthcoming; so my master thought it best to

299
let well alone, if only for the sake of the young lady
that was married to this so-called Sir Rupert.”
“So,” said the coroner, “he compounded a felony,
did he? He concealed his knowledge of this infamous
affair, and suffered the real Sir Rupert to be kept out
of his rights. Very bad, very bad !"
“He's dead and gone,” said Mr. Salamons quietly.
“ If you've got anything to say against him, you'd
better not say it to me. I've served him for nineteen
years and upwards, and I always found him a good
master.”
Very little transpired at the inquest to throw any
light on the manner in which Major Varney had met his
death. And the verdict returned by the coroner's jury
was to the effect that the Major had been wilfully mur-
dered by some person or persons unknown.
All this time James Arnold, otherwise Sir Rupert
Lisle, lay in a weary stupor, watched over by the two
medical men, and at a respectful distance by Mr. Daw-
son ; for the country practitioner held firmly by the
patient, who had dropped like some blessed windfall into
his little surgery at Underhill.
Nothing was known in the sick-room, nor, indeed, in
any other part of the mansion, of the discoveries which
had been made in the presence of the coroner.
Other discoveries were being made meanwhile at
the farthest extremity of Sussex. A man of suspicious
appearance had attempted to change a five-pound note
at a public-house in a little village on the coast. The
landlord, who, with all the rest of the county, was full
of the Major's murder, had contrived to detain the man
while he telegraphed to the detectives at Lislewood.
The landlord's suspicions flew shivering along the wires
from station to station, and in three hours a grave-
looking elderly gentleman dropped into the taproom
where Gilbert Arnold sat smoking strong tobacco, and
stupefying himself with long draughts of beer. The

grave gentleman had arrested half a dozen men already
on suspicion ; but he made no difficulty whatever in
apprehending a seventh; and before nightfall Gilbert
Arnold was lodged once more in Lewes gaol, the
searchers of which establishment found the Major's
watch and chain in a corner of his knapsack, and the
Major's bank notes in the heel of his boot.
The man seemed strangely indifferent to his imminent
peril. He let the searchers do what they pleased with
him, and sat staring straight before him, with a fierce
unnatural light burning in his yellow-green eyes.
The prisoner in the next cell heard him talk to him-
self very often in the dead hours of the night.
“I came back to do it,” he muttered. “I said I'd do
it, and I kep' my word. They may hang me if they
like, but I kep' my word.”
He took a savage pleasure in repeating this, chuckling
aloud, and rubbing his great horny hands. In the dim
grey dawn the ghastly face of his victim glared at him
from the shadows of his narrow cell; but he did not
shrink from the hideous spectre, as another murderer
might have done; he rather invited and defied it.
"I see you,” he said; “I see your false blue eyes and
your lying smile, your foxy whiskers and your sly wicked
mouth. But I've kep' my word, and I've made you pay
for all. Scores are clear between us now, Major Gran.
ville Varney."
Three days after Gilbert Arnold's arrest, his wretched
son expired; not before he had attested, in his last mo-
ments, to the genuine nature of the document found
upon the murdered man.
“Yes,” he gasped, “ that was my signature. But it
was none of my doing, nor yet father's. From first to
last it was the Major did it all.”
One of the medical men waited upon Olivia in her
solitary apartment to tell her of her husband's death.
She received the tidings very quietly; but a few
minutes afterwards, for the first time in her life, fell
fainting from her chair.

They sent for her father, and once more the Colonel
held his darling child in his arms.
“I have been cruelly punished for my wicked ambition,”
she sobbed. “I have known nothing but misery and
humiliation within these walls. Take me away, papa;
take me back to the Grove; I shall never again think
poverty hard or bitter. Take me home, dear father, if
you will let me call it home again."
Claribel Walsingham was away at Hastings while
these strange events were so rapidly succeeding one
another. One of the county magistrates, an old friend
of the family, went to her, to tell her of all that had
happened, and to consult with her upon the best means
of finding her son, if the real Sir Rupert still lived.
The first and simplest step to be taken, was to put an
advertisement in the Times newspaper. It was worded
thus :
“Sir Rupert Lisle.—Any person able to afford infor-
mation respecting this gentleman, is requested to com.
municate with Mr. Wilmore, solicitor, Lislewood, Sussex.”
The advertisement was answered two days afterwards
by Mr. Walter Remorden in person.
It was a strange story that the young curate told to
the Lislewood solicitor--a story already partly known
to the reader, and which was confirmed by the presence
of Richard Saunders, the obscure lad educated at Bel-
minster, and who solemnly declared himself to be the
real Sir Rupert Lisle. The history which the young
man gave of himself was sufficiently clear. He told
of the accident upon the hill called Beecher's Ride; of
how he awoke in a hospital, where he lay for months,
and whence he was taken by a man, who called himself
his uncle George, but whom he remembered as the
servant of a big gentleman with yellow whiskers and
moustaches. He told of the lonely seaside village at
which he had lived with an old nurse; and he told that
dismal story of the means which uncle George, otherwise


## p. 302 (#306) ############################################

302
Lady Lisle.
Mr. Alfred Salamons, had taken to make him believe all
his childish memories the delusions of a diseased brain.
They sent for Mr. Salamons to confirm the young
man's story, but that gentleman had left Lislewood
Park very quietly almost immediately after the coroner's
inquest.
But there were other means by which the story of the
young man known as Richard Saunders could be con-
firmed. There was maternal instinct, which led Claribel
Walsingham to open her arms, with a wild cry of delight
and a thrill of affection such as she had never felt for
the impostor James Arnold. There was the young man's
own rapture at the sight of his mother.
“I remember you as if you were a dream, mamma,"
he cried, as Claribel clung about his neck; “I remember
you so well, dearest mother; but you had long fair curls
then, and I used to play with them and with your gold
chain ; and I remember the room they called the nursery,
and papa's picture. I have talked of them so often when
they called me mad.”
But the strongest confirmation of all came at the
assizes, when Gilbert Arnold was tried for the murder of
Major Granville Varney, and being found guilty, made
full confession the very next day, not only of the murder,
but also of the long train of circumstances which led up
to it. He confessed how he had been induced by the
Major to substitute his own son for the son of Sir
Reginald Lisle, that by such means the Major might be-
come, by his hold over the impostor, the actual master
of the Lislewood estate. He told the whole intricate
story of the plot concocted by the Indian officer, and
confirmed the statement made by Richard Saunders,
otherwise Sir Rupert Lisle.
So Claribel Walsingham returned with her son to the
house which she had abandoned during James Arnold's
usurpation, and found on her return that Mrs. Granville
Varney had quitted Lislewood for the Continent, leaving
a letter and a sealed packet behind her, addressed to
Mrs. Walsingham. It was a long letter, crossed and


## p. 303 (#307) ############################################

At Rest.
303
re-crossed upon two sheets of note paper. Claribel's
cheeks grew white as she read this letter; then, with
trembling fingers, she broke the seal of the packet.
It contained half a dozen brief notes, written in a bold
dashing soldierly hand, and tied together with a faded
ribbon.
They were the love-letters written by Arthur Wal-
singham to the actress he had married in the town of
Southampton—the actress whom he abandoned on his
wedding day; and with whom he afterwards negotiated
a formal separation through the means of Major Gran-
ville Varney ; who undertook, for a fixed sum, to marry
the lady in supposed ignorance of her previous marriage.
This was the history of that terrible power which the
Major had possessed over Arthur Walsingham.
Člaribel thrust the little packet between the bars of
the grate, and watched the letters till the last fragment
of burnt and blackened paper floated slowly up the
chimney. Then, with a composed face and tranquil
manuer, she saft the apartment to look for her son.
She found him in the dining-room, contemplating his
father's portrait.
“Rupert,” she said, laying her slender hand upon his
shoulder, “Rupert, you will learn to love me very
dearly-will you not? I have led a very unhappy life
until this hour, and I look to you, and to my poor boy
Arthur, for the happiness of the future.”
Is it necessary to tell much more?
Need we tell of that dreary morning upon which, im.
penitent and hardened to the last, Gilbert Arnold came
tottering out of Lewes gaol, to suffer the last sentence
of the law ?
Need we look farther on to a happier day, nearly a
year afterwards, when there were two weddings at
Lislewood Church, and the beadle was once more in a
pleasant fluster of importance ?
There is no splendour at the double wedding. The
village children have new dresses, it is true, and have

been out for days ransacking the woods for flowers to
strew the pathway of brides and bridegrooms. There is
to be an ox roasted in Lislewood Park, and great casks
of ale have been brought up from the cellars and ranged
under a great cedar on the lawn-ale enough to drown
half the parish, one would think ; but there is no fashion-
able crowd, no long string of carriages ; only a simple
procession of two happy couples, attended by about a
dozen friends.
First, Mr. Hayward's daughter Blanche, leaning on
the arm of Sir Rupert Lisle, and smiling brightly on
the school children, who throw their flowers under her
feet; while close behind them comes Walter Remorden,
with Olivia by his side. Colonel Marmaduke has given
his daughter into the curate's hands with a pride and
happiness he never felt in the marriage which had seemed
such a splendid one.
The worthy rector of Lislewood obtained a better
living from the bishop of the diocese, and abandoned the
pleasant rectory, shut in by shady gardens, and close
under the shadow of the grey old church tower, to
Walter Remorden and his wife.
The poor of Lislewood learned to bless the day which
brought them Blanche, Lady Lisle; the third who had
borne that name within twenty years.
The schoolmaster's devotion had received its reward
from the rector's daughter before the discovery of the
young man's real position. Blanche conquered her first
girlish fancy for the handsome curate very soon after
Walter Remorden's confession, and little by little her
friendship for the young schoolmaster grew into a
warmer feeling. A generous-hearted woman is always
grateful to the man who gives her a pure and disin-
terested affection, and gratitude of that kind is nearly
related to the tender womanly pity which is said to be
akin to love.
· Claribel Walsingham never left Lislewood after her
son's restoration. She lived to see a band of bright
children playing merrily in the gardens where Sir

Rupert Lisle had wandered listlessly to and fro in his
companionless childhood.
Mrs. Granville Varney lived and died in Paris, leaving
behind her a considerable part of the handsome fortune
which the Major had accumulated from his pretty pick-
ings out of the Lislewood property.
Poor Rachel Arnold came out of the County Asylum,
to inhabit the pretty Gothic lodge at the gates of Lisle-
wood once again. And this time she found peace and
tranquillity in the simple rustic dwelling; for Gilbert
Arnold was no longer there to torment and tyrannize
over his meek helpmate. She was enfeebled by the
trials through which she had passed; but she was at
peace, and enjoyed a nearer approach to happiness than
anything she had known since her unfortunate marriage.
The Lislewood children often lingered at the lodge to
talk to the pale-faced mistress of the little dwelling;
and the brightest moments of Rachel Arnold's life were
those in which Claribel Walsingham's grandchildren
clustered round her knees.

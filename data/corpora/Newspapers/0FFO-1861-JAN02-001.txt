F. V. to A. V.—I have consulted the same legal
authority employed by me in drawing the deed for No. 400, and
have received from him the following paper, addressed apparently to
you. "By the laws of M. you can convey all your share of the real and
personal estate of which your father died possessed, by a deed to be
executed by you and acknowledged before a U. S. Consul, Minister, or
Commissioner. This deed may contain either a special description of
each lot of land, or a general description, and will pass a good title, sub¬
ject, of course, to dower. It will also be sufficient authority to the exe¬
cutors to pay over your share of personal property. Our laws require
the use of wax or wafer in the seal affixed." To this I add, why not em¬
power the executors, immediately, to pay over past interest, and what
may yet accrue?

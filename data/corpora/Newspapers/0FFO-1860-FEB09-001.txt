REVERLEY ELECTION PROSECUTIONS.—
At a large and influential MEETING of the Inhabitants of the
Borough of Beverley and the neighbourhood, held in the Mechanics'-
hall, Beverley, on the 6th of February, 1860, the following resolutions
esa
Moved by Alfred Crosskill, Esq., seconded by Mr. Alderman Foster:
That, in the opinion of this Meeting, the order by the House of
Commons for the Attorney-General to prosecute Messrs. Daniel Boyes
and Robert Taylor, is exceedingly harsh and unjust, as it is founded
on evidence taken in an inqiury to which they were not parties, and on
statements which they had no opportunity of contradicting, answering,
or explaining, and that to employ the power and influence of the House
of Commons against two individuals charged under such circumstances
is a most oppressive measure, and deserves the strongest reprobation.


Moved by Mr. William Meldrum, seconded by Thomas Beaumont,
Esq.
That as the charges against Messrs. Boyes and Taylor can only be
supported by the evidence of witnesses whose statements will criminate
themselvee, the order of the House of Commons holds out encourage¬
ment for a class of testimony the employment of which has always been
denounced by the soundest constitutional anthorities, and that to invite
a number of persons to give evidence against themeelves is in direct
contradiction to the practice of all the regular tribunals of the country.
will estahlish a dangerous precedent, and is in the highest degree de¬

ts of public justice and

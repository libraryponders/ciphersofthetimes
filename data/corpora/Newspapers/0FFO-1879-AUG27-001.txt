apparent rudeness, for God knows it was not meant. I have
never for a single moment had an unkind thought towards any of you.
but have ever prayed that our old friendship might be renewed. I
trust you will all see this and forgive me, for my grief is almost more

To LANDED PROPRIETORS, Clergymen, Agents or Factors of

THE BOUNDARIES in part of the COUNTY of

Parliament, 4th and 5th Victorne, cap. 30 (continued in force by the
Survey (Great Britain) Continuance Act, 1875); and the Sketch Maps

As the Boundaries laid down on the Government Maps were pointed
out to the Ordnance Surveyors by meresmen, or persons appointed by
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembled in Quarter Sessions, as
directed by the Acts of Parliament quoted above, the Maps may possi¬
bly become evidence respecting the Boundaries, and thus affect the
right of rating lands. Therefore, proprietors, agents, and other per¬
sons to whom this notice is addressed, are particularly requested to
examine the Sketch Maps, to ascertain that the Boundaries of those
Lands in and for which they are interested have been correctly defined
and laid down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for com¬
parison with the Boundary Sketch Maps, that, should any differences
be found, they may be ioquired into, and corrected before the maps
are engraved and published.

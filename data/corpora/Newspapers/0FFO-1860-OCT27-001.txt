CRYSTAL PALACE.—Rarey's Horse Taming.—
THIS DAY (Saturday), the 27th inst.—In order to render Mr.
RAREY'S LAST APPEARANCE in this country a fittieg ter¬
mination to his coreer, great exertion has been made to secure
horses which shall put his system to the severest test. One of
thom is a young Irish mare of the most frightfully vicious and un¬
manageable propensities, the property of a gentleman in London.
She has been in England seven menths, and during the whole of that
time she has been kept in a stable by herself, and has allowed no one
to groom or even touch her, fighting, kicking, and screaming in the
most furious manner whenever the attempt was made. Another horse
is Billy, the property of Mr. Austen, of Sydenham. This horse, though
generally quiet, will allow no one to touch his hind legs to groom or
shee them; so unconquerable is this habli, that his owner has, on
more that one occasion, been cbliged to drive him 43 miles without a
shoe, until he conld find the proper apparatue to thraw and secure the
horse while being shod. Cruiser, who is now Mr. Rarey's property, will,
on this occasion, also take his farewell of the English public. The
exhibition will commence at 3 o'clock in the Centre Transept, where
the ring, with strong barriers will be evected. Admission half-a-crown;

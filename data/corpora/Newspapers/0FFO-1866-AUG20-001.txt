obtained in the cause "Duc de Montebello v. Gemmer," restraining
the defendant and all others from selling or parting with sundry cases
of Rhenish wine, imported from Rotterdam, containing bottles bearing
imitation Duc de Montebello labels and corks, and further prohibiting

ing 3,000 bottles of wine, bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels
and corks, seized by the French Customs' authorities (the said spurious
wines having been sent from Germany and Havre to be thence shipped

BATH NEUENAHR, the celebrated new spa, one
hour from the Rhine, between Cologne and Coblenz, possessed of
the finest alkaline, mild dissolving, but at the same time of strengthen¬
ing properties, and richer in carbonic acid than either Ems or Vichy.
Temperature 80 to 104 Fhrt. The waters are peculiarly beneficial in
diseases of the mucous membrane, especially in chronic catarrh of the
laryux, of the bronchia, and of the stomach, also for gout and rheuma¬
tism. The Kurhotel (where are also the telegraph and post stations) is
combined with the bathing houses. The Hotel Garni Mariensprudel is
situate near the springs and Kurgaarden. For climate and position
Neuenahr has a decided advantage over the other spas on the Rhine.
The pamphlet by the late Professor Miller, in Edinburgh, will give
further information. English Divine Service in the Kurhotel. Visitors
may safely come to Nenenahr, which is a secluded spot, and one far
distant from the possibility of war.

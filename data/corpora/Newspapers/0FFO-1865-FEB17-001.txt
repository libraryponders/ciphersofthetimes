MARRIAGE FEES in BETHNAL-GREEN. —We,
the undersigned, have been advised that a clergyman has no
legal righet to sel l t e fes of his benefice.
The Rev. E. Coke Incumbent of St. James's Church, Bethnal¬
green, proposes that if the benevolent public will give him £100 a year
he will resign his claim to marriage fees, although such fees cannot
amount to more than £40 a year.
The poor in Bethnal-green are as able and willing to pay their mar¬
riage fees as the poor in any other part of London, and the amounts of
such fees were equitably settled some time since by the late Bishop. In
any case of inability to pay, the resident incumbents of the parish have
ever been willing to sacrifice their fees.
The undersigned are sure that they only reflect the opinion of the
parish at large when they say that Mr. Coke, probably from ignorance,
naturally arising from his home being at Tottenham, and not in
Bethnal-green, has, uninteniontially perhaps, but most certainly, libelled
both the inhabitants and clergy of the parish by his proposed scheme,
the practical effect of which is to increase the income of his living.
Should Mr. Coke succeed in raising the proposed fund, he would not
be legally bound to dispense with marriage fees, and there certainly
would be no obligation, either moral or legal, on his successor to do so.

HYDROPULT.—e
aution.—Devices in
toi n atoion of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are calculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. Each
hydropult has a brass label attached to one cylinder, on which is
stamped the following, to wit, "The Hydropult, Vose's Patent,
manufactured only by Griffiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles
Pomeroy Button, proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London."
In this connexion it may be well to state that the hydro¬
pult is the only force-pump in the market, weighing but Sib.,
that will throw seven or eight gallone of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. The hydropult will
draw water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. The
hydropult can be used for all purposes to which a bydrant or force¬
pump is applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances
are useless. The hydropult has been recommended as an efficient and
useful fire engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of
Great Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department
as fire engines. Robert Hogg. LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibbard,
Esq., F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other
well-known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable
garden implement. The hydropult has been recommended by the
Gardeners Chronicle, Journal of Horticulture, Gardeners' Magazine,
Daily Telegraph, Liverpool Daily Post, Commercial Daily List, Illus¬
trated News of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Maga¬
zine, City Press, Insurance Gazette, and other first class journals
throughout Great Britain. An Illustrated Prospectus, with testi¬
monials, sent free on application to CHARLES POMEROY
BUTTON, 142 and 143, Chapside, London.
NOTICE of NEW PREMISES.—JAMES CAR¬

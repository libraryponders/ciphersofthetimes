MESSRS, S. ALLSOPP and SONS feel it incum¬
bent on them to publith for the satisfaction of their customers,
he following iotter which they have received from Dr. Hassall, in cor¬
rection of an error in his recent book on Food:—12, Pall-mall, S.W.,
London, 9th March, 1876.—Gontlemen, I am very much annoyed in¬
doed to find, that, through some inadvertence on my part, a most in
forthnate error has been made in my book, which has just been pub¬
lished, entitied "Food; its Adulterations, and the Methods for their
Detection," rolative to the water used by you in the brewing of your
justly celebtated ales. It appears, that in quoting at page 681, the
analysis made by Dr. Henry Bottinger of the water nsed in your
brewery, it is stated that it contains 7 65 grains of sulphate of zine, in¬
stead, as it should be, 765 grains of suiphate of potash, and that this
has led to some very unfortunate comments, on the purity of your ales,
in "Nature" of last week. It is, of courss, hardly necessary for me to
state that there is no trace of any such deleterious ingredient os sul¬
phate of zine to be found in your water, and that the sulphate of
potash, which is one of its natural ingredients, is perfectly harmless in
every way. No one can regret this mistake more than 1 do; but, as
some mitigation of it, and to show that it was not an intentional one,
I beg to refer you to page 692 of the same book, in which I state dis¬
tinctly, that having subjected to a most careful andlysis no less than
40 samples of your bitter beer. I found them "to consist of the pro¬
ducts of malt and hops, and the constituents of pure spring water, nn
other ingredient of any kind being discevered, ether organic or in¬
organic," and that the above 40 samples " were procured undercircum¬
stances which precluded the poseibility of error, fallacy, of

tion for the selection." I will at once write to the Editor

and ask him to be good enough to insert a copy of this letter, which
trust will be satisfactory to you, in his next number, and you are of
course at liberty to make any further use of it that you may think
proper.—I am, Gentlenien, Yours truly, Arthur H. Hassall.—Messrs.

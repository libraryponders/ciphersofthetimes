POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTION (Limited).
Capital £20,000, in 2,000 shares of £10 each.—The Directors beg
to call the attention of the public to this Institution, as they are most
anxious to render it as useful as possible, which can only be done by
its being well supported. They, therefore, earnestly ask those who
wish to confer a benefit on their fellow-creatures, by affording them
opportunities to obtain general information in science and art at the
cheapest rate, and afford rational amusement for themselves and
children, to come forward forthwith, and take up the remaining shares.
If only a few hundred people would take one share each (which would
give them the privilege of free admission, alone an ample remunera¬
tion for the cost) it would accomplish the object. The Directors are
happy to say that now upwards of 1,100 shares are disposed of. The
total cost of the premises and plant has been ascertained, which does
not exceed the amount originally contemplated, and no liability can
attach to any one beyond the amount subscribed for.

ONE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD.— This
reward will be given for the REGISTRY of the MARRIAGE of
ALEXANDER VICTOR, a French teacher, with ELIZA HAINES,
the daughter of Thomas Haines, master gunner, R.N., or to any per¬
son who, from having been present at the marriage, or any other
cause, is able legally to establish the fact. The following circumstances
will indicate the best points for inquiry.The ceremony took place
about the year 1827, while Thomas Haines was a mate on board
the Georgiana East Indiaman. Shortly afterwards Mr. and Mrs.
Victor went to reside with their mother, Mrs. Haines, in St. John¬
street, Commercial-road; and a little later these three opened, a
millinery business in Hatton-gardens. It is believed that Ellza Haines
was at the time of the marriage an apprentice in the establishment of
Misses Barton and Stevens, west-end dressmakers. In 1837 (10 years
later) Mr. and Mrs. Victor were residing at 37, Park-street, Bristol, Mr.
Victor pursuing, in that neighbourhood, his avocation of teache
French. This continued till 1840, when Mr. and Mrs. Victor entered
into partnership with another family to open an academy at West
Clifton-house, where Mrc. Victor's sister, Harriett Haines, came to
complete her education. In 1842, bankruptcy, unfortunately, ensued,
and Mr. and Mrs. Victor have not since been heard of. All communi¬
cations to be addressed to Major W. B. Lumley, 23, Kildare-gardens,
Westbourne-park, Lond.

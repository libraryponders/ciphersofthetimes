MRS. T. did not like to ask Mrs. M. Jones to write
to No. 100 when she was in England. If she will do so now it
will make her very happy, and will be the last favour she will ask.

moment in seeking further written instructious as before at

too precious.
IS there pure vitality in that which would imprison
the justice of true judgment, rather than generously cast away
the vile chains from a fearless opponent? I ask it, not for my own
sake, but in proof that truth is existent, it can have but the highest
interpretation, for it is the light, the atmosphere of Heaven. Blind¬
ness, malignity, and sin can dim its purity truth alone can bid it
rise; but it is in all essen tials most triumphant when mest basely
dethroned. — January 5th.

TO MEMBERS of BOTH HOUSES of PARLIA¬
MENT, &c.—The JOHN CLARE NATIONAL FUND. Bellin
Treaty. The Earl of Beaconsfield, on his return from Berlin, adver¬
tised to the world "Peace with Honour." Mr. Parnell, M.P., 14th
March, 1878, in Parliament said, "They had had an animated debate
on the subject of the East; but if they had not had their Ironclad
Fleet, they could not have stood long in the East, and could not have
had that Ironclad Fleet in the Dardanelles. Now, he maintained.
that if it had not been for the painstaking exertions of Mr. John
Clare, this question of iron shipbuilding would not have been so much
in advance for another 10 years." Mr. Roebuck, M.P.—But for "the
Fleet at the Dardanelles, the Russian Army would have been in Con¬
stautinople." (Cheers.) The First Lord of the Admiraity, Mr. Smith,
at the Mansion-house Banquet.—The Fleet at the Dardanelles caused
"the happy resuit which we were now rejoicing at, of a peace with
honour to this country." (Hear, hear.) Mr. Thomas Brassey, M.P.,
at Birkenhead.—"Lord Beaconsfield deserves credit for avoiding a
war with Russia, which would have cost this country 100 millions
sterling."—Morning Paper, 19th April, 1879. Mr. Clare would refer
those persons desirous of learning the truth and facts of the trial of
Clare v. the Queen, and the indictments of the Admiraity witnesses at
the Westminster Police Court, 1863 and 1866, to the immortalizing
speech of Mr. O'Donuell, M.P., in the House of Commons, 14th
March, 1878 ; also to the questions thereon put by Mr. Biggar, M.P.,
Joe e ecretary Cross and Mr. George Ward Hunt, vide Hansarade.
1877.78. Lord Palmerston, in 1865, said, "Clare, bombard the Ad¬
miralty well, fight it out, as tney have used your patent, &c., and will
be obliged to pay you; never rest until you make them pay. The
metal ships constructed from Mr. Clare's Patent of 185 settled the
Russian war, 1854-6 ; also prevented a war with Russia, 1878. Mr.
Clare, being unable to obtain from the Admiralty attention, either for
claims litigated in "Clare v. the Queen," or on those claims that have
neither been before the Courts nor the subject of litigation, has no
course open to him but a Select Committee of the House of Commons.
Mr. Clare, on the above concatinated dates and facts, respectfully
appeals to Right Honourable and Honourable Members of Pariia¬
ment to support his case in the House of Commons on a Select Com¬
mttee being moved for ; and to the liberal public, on national
grounds, for assistance in purse and person to enable nim to obtain
nis rights on a "clear stage and no favour," so that justice may
triumph and right prevail. Hence, on public grounds, the co-opera¬
tion of patriots, philanthropists, upholders of peace, and the main¬
tainers of England's honour afloat, is sought by JOHN CLARE,
H.M.S.B., Liverpoo .
THE JOHN CLARE NATIONAL FUND.—Mr.
Clare, on the fact that England's navy is based solely on the

forward accruing thereon to Great Britain's national defences affuat
in upholding the peace of the world.—JOHN CLARE. H.M.S.B.,

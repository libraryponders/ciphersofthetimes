CAUTION.—The Public are warned against the
attempts of those wh seck as near as they dare to copy
the design of Messrs. D. NICOLL and Co.'s PATENTED GAR¬
MENTS, and particularly with regard to the dual garment called
the Rug Paletot. Unprincipled persons, who have only suddenly
awakoned to the advantage of this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to pass off clumsy
imitations for that which D. Nicoll and Co. have already proved
to be the cheanest article ever offered to the public. The safeguard
will be the right to demand to see the trade mark, which may be thus
described: the Coats of Arms of London and Pans are printed or
woven on to a loop used for hanging un the garment, and between
these emblems of the two citier the words "Nicoll's Patent" appear¬

racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real () article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
only purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfciters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the toilot.

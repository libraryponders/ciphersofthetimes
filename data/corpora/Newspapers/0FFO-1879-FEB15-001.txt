FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
offort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tai perfet FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDIORAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 129, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seoing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
broved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
receguized principles of modern nscal legisiation; (9 contrary to the
established laws of political economs; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical education in its applit
cation to stiversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every rhade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application shouid be made to the undersigned.

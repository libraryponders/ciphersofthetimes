—Notice is hereby given, that SAMUEL BARFOOT, son of
Samuel Barfoot by his second marriage, is entitled to part of the
estate, late of his uncle Robert Barfoot, late of Broughton, in the
parish of Manchester, in Lancashire, gentleman, deceased. Samuel
Barfoot the father died in 1843 at Cardiff, in Glamorgan, and at one
time resided near Callington, in Cornwall, and theretofore about
Corscombe, in Dorset. The said Samuel Barfoot the nephew had
among others a half brother Theophilus Barfoot, who died near Port
Louls, in the Mauritigs, about 1851, and the same Samuel Barfoot was
brought up after the death of his mother by his grandmother or mar¬
ried aunt on the mother's side, who were, it is believed, called
Edmonds, and resided at or near Dartmouth, in Devon, his mother
being supposed to come from about Callington. The same Samuel
Barfoot went to sea; afterwards resided from about 1848 to 1852 in the
Mauritius and left there about 1852 for New South Wales, and has not
been heard of since 1853, and would now be about 40 years old. The
said Samuel Barfoot, if living, is requested to communicate with me,

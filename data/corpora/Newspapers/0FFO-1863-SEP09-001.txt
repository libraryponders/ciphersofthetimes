induces them to reduce the prices, which range from 20s.—S. and B.

NEW ACHROMATIC MAGIC and DISSOLV¬
ING LANTERNS.—The want of brillancy having been always
a great complaint with magic lanterns, Messrs. S. have discovered a
great improvement, which overcomes this difficulty, and which can be
supplied at their usuallow prices, being much lower than the prices of the
ordinary non achromatic lanterns of other houses. This important stride
is obtained by substituting for the common non-achromatic lens (now in
use) a pure first class achromatic lens. It must be understood that the
addition of such an improvement is a great increase in the expense of
the manufacture of the lantern; but Messrs. S. do not rise their price
in anticipation of a large sale. Persons are invited to apply for a
catalogue, sent free.—S. and B. SOLOMONS, opticians to the Govern¬
ment, 39, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly.

greatly regret: to inform their patrons, specially those residing
abroad, that having discovered a large quantity of letters directed to
their customers secreted on their premises, and having reason to be¬
lieve that more have been destroyed and the postage stamps in every
case dishonestly appropriated, they hasten to make this public an¬
nouncement of the fact, in order to remove from the minds of the
numerous customers who have been inconvenienced by this untoward

political economists, politicians of every shade of opinion, and notably
by the Press of the United Kingdom. A vigorous effort will be made
in the next Session of Parliament to secure for the silver trade a
sound, free-trade, commercial basis. Full particulars relating to the
subject may be obtained from Edward J. Watherston, 12, Pall-mall

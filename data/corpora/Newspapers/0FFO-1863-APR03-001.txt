CHRIST BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN.
Engraved in line by J. H. Watt. After the picture by Sir Charles
Eastlake, P.R.A. As a work of high art,i n point of subject and
in style of execution, this is, without exception, one of the noblest pict
tures ever painted; while, from the power as well as refinement thrown
into the engraving, it forms an unparalleled object of decoration,
alike from its effective yet harmonious appearance and the sublimity
of the undying lessons it is ever present to instil. Although the en¬
graved plate cost the publishers £5,000, it was destroyed before a single
imperfect impression was printed, in order to ensure an unique work
of art, of a constantly increasing value, to every possessor of any state
of proof or print. The engraving is in pure line, of a commanding
size. 22 by 29 ; it is printed on paper 44 by 33. The publishers guarantee
every impression to be perfett, and that no more than the present
existing copies will ever be produced. Orders are now being received
for the limited number of remaining copies at the following prices:—

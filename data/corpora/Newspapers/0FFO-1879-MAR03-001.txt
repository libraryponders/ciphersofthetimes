As the boundaries laid down on the Government maps were pointed
out to the Ordnance burveyors by meresmen, or persons appointed by
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembied in Quarter Sessions, as
directed by the Acts of Parliament quoted above, the maps may pos¬
sibly become evidence respecting the boundaries, and thus affect the
right of rating lands, Therefore, proprietors, agents, and other persons
to whom this notice is addressed, are particularly requested to examine
the sketch maps, to ascertain that the boundaries of those lands in
and for which they are interested have been correctly defined and laid
down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for comparison
with the boundary sketch maps, that, should any differences be
found, they may be inquired into and corrected before the maps are
engraved and published.

FREE TRAD' in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
ain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that no other suilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (9 contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east. London.

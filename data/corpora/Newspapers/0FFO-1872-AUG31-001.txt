RISHOP of LONDONS FUND. —Kensal New-town
Free School.—In the year 1865 a lady gave £1,000 to this fund
anonymously for the ERECTION ofa FREE SCHOOL in KENSAL
NEW-TOWN. The Committee, however, find that such a school could
not be supported, but that the inhabitants of the district are well able
to pay the ordinary fees. They propose, therefore, to expend this sum
in the erection of a National School, the plans for which have been
submitted by a Local Committee to the Privy Council. The Com¬
mittee request that the DONOR will kindly COMMUNICATE with
them and state whether she have any objection to the proposed change
of plan.

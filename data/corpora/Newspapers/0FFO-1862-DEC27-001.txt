muriatic acid, spirits of turpentine, lucifer matches, fusees, con¬
greves, wax vestas, German tinder, jackets or other wearing apparel

CAUTION.—HYDROPULT PATENTS.—Un¬
principled parties will infringe valuable inventions, and are now
palming on the public an infringement on the Hydropult Patent. This
is to notify, that said pirates and all persons using or vending this
article will, in due time, be prosecuted. No machine contained in a
bucket is the Hydropult. Every Hydropult has a trade label affixed,
as follows: "The Hydropult, a Portable Fire Annihilator and Garden
Engine, Griffith and Browett, manufacturers, Birmingham; Charles
P. Button, general agent; Vose's Patent;" and is sold at the uniform
rate of two guineas, complete, with 2½feet suction and 3-feet delivery
hose, galvanized wire strainer, rose or sprinkler, and fire jet. It is an
easy matter to imitate the Hydropult in appearance, and thereby de¬
ceive the public; therefore this caution. The Hydropult weighs but
3 1bs., will throw 7 or 8 gallons of water per minute 55 feet when worked
by the power of one man. Has been recommended as an efficient fire
engine by the principal fire insurance companies of Great Britain.
Thomas Rivers, Esq., the eminent florist, and other well-known gentle¬
men, recommend it as an invaluable garden implement. J. Spencer,
Esq., Inspector of the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from
Fire, certifles to its efficiency in saving valuable property in Bayswater
from destruction. The city and provincial press accord to the invention
the utmost praise. All who purchase the Hydropult are satisfied with
its action, for it stands upon its own merit, advertising to do only what
it will do, and each machine guaranteed to be perfect.—Hydropult¬

CREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 129, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, secing that no other suilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
catablished laws of political cconomy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to tochnical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths work. The tax has been condemued as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political cconomists, pobticians of every shade
of opmion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

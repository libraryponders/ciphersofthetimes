Registrar-General, vide The Times, June 2d, 1870 :—"Dr. Franigland
finds that by filtering the domestic supply of his own house (West
Middlesex Company's water) through animal charcoal, the organic
matter is redueed to about one-fourth by the process, the water
so filtered containing less organic matter than the tustly celebrated
water supplied to Manchester from the Derbyshire Hills." The Filters
referred to in the above were supplied by this Company, who
cantion the public to be very particular in addressing thier letters, or
unfortunately, if addressed to the Company with no number they may
miscarry. Read "Water and Its Impurities," by post 2d. Note the

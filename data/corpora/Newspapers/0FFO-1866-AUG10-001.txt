tity. Hampers of six dozen are sent carriage free.

ment, No. 39, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly. Patronized by the late

CHOLERA.—Closet Flusher, and Disinfector.—
(Messrs. MOREWOOD and Co., Dowgate Dock, Upper Thames-¬
street, E.C., beg to call the attention of the public and all sanitary
officers, managers of large establishments, &c., to Dr. OBRYEN's
SELF-ACTING FLUSHER for DRAINS and CLOSETS, which also
disinfects and requires no attention. Whereas the secretions from
cholera patients are the actual source of infection and the active cause
of spreading this disease, the want of such a simple means of flushing
and disinfecting at the same moment has been long felt, and is now an
absolute necessity in every house. This flusher is moderate in cost,
capable of universal application, and can be seen in daily action at
Markham-street Infant Schools, Chelsea. Messrs. Morewood consider
it a duty to the public to direct attention to this simple and most
effectual means of saving life and staying the progress of cholers.

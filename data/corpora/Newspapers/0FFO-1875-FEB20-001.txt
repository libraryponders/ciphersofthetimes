JOHN KYNASTON, of 88, Queen-street, Cheapside, in the City of
London, Gentleman, to be one of the Perpetual Commissioners for
taking the acknowledgments of deeds to be executed by married
women, under the Act passed for the abolition of fines and recoveries,

the county of Middlesex, and the cities of London and Westminster.
SOCIETY for the ABOLITION of VIVISECTION,
or putting animals to death by torture, under any pretext what
The object of the Society is a law for the total suppression of Vivi¬
section. To call on the Legisiature for less would be to admit the
principle (and thereby perpetuate the enormity) that man is justified
in selfishly inflicting agony on the innocent.
The opponents of the Slave Trade agitated, not for restriction, but
abolition. The wrongs perpetrated by man on animals are even more
dire than those inflicted by him on his own species.

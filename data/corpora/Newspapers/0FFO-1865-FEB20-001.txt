HYDROPULT.—Caution.— Devices in mitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are calculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. Each
hydropult has a brass label attached to one cylinder, on which is
stamped the following, to wit, "The Hydropult, Vose's Patent,
manufactured only by Grifiiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles
Pomeroy Button, proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London,"
In this connexion it may be well to state that the hydro¬
pult is the ouly force-pump in the market, weighing but 8ib.
that will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. The hydropult will
draw water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. The
hydropult can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or force¬
pump is applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances
are useless. The hydropult has been recommended as an efficient and
useful fire engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of
Great Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department

ines. Robert Hogg. LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibbard,
Esq., F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other
well-known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable
garden implement. The hydropult has been recommended by the
Gardeners' Chronicle, Journal of Horticulture, Gardeners Magazine,
Daily Telegraph, Liverpool Daily Post, Commercial Daily List, Illus¬
trated News of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Maga¬
zine, City Press, Insurance Gazette, and other first class journals

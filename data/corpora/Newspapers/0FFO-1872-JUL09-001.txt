to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
Wotherspoun v. Curric," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indisputably eata¬
Mished, would also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penaity of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
been indnced to buy it, that to save them from total loss wo will
allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paialey, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entall a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.
CAUTION.—£1,000.—Whereas it has come to my
knowledge that since the publication of my book, "A Sincere
Voice of Warning against Quacks," &c., many of these quasi-doctors
are maliciously circulating all kinds of false reports, one of which con¬
cerns the value of my tostimonials.—This is to give notice, that the
above amount will be paid to any person who can disprove the genuine¬
ness of my Electric Appliances, or of my testimonials and scientiflo
documents, as published in my pamphiet (Galvanism, Nature's Chisf
Restorer of Impaired Vital Energy), and elsewhere. I am at all times
willing to show experimental proofs of the former, and the originals
of the latter, to any person interested who may call upon me at my

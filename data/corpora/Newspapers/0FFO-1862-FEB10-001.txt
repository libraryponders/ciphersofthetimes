LLOYD's REGISTER of BRITISH and FOREIGN
SHIPPING.—ANCHORS and CABLES.—Notice is hereby
given, that the Committee of this Society have for some time had the
subject of their recommendations contained in Table No. 22, attached
to the Rules, regarding anchors and cables, under their consideration,
and in reference thereto they have passed the following resolutions,

1. That the Table No. 22 be amended by defining a minimum weight
for anchors of approved make, whether ordinary or patent, thus discon¬
tinuing any distiuction in favour of (so called) patent anchors.
2. That in future one weight only for anchors be recognised, and that
the lighter weight, or that hitherto required for anchors with wood
stocks, be adopted in framing the scale.
3. That it be made a rule that two of the bower anchors be of at least
the weight set forth in the table, and that then the third anchor may be
lighter; the reduction in weight, however, not to exceed 15 per cent.
4. That the stream anchors be one-third the weight of the bowers, the
first kedge anchor one-half the weight of the stream anchors, and the
second kedge one-half the weight of the first xedge anchor.
5. That all anchors be subjected to a proof strain equal to that
shown in the table No. 92.
6. That the recognition of the test for chain cables, known as the
"ordinary" or "merchant" proof, be discontinned; and that all new
ships be required to be supplied with chains which have been submitted
to a proof strain equal to that known as the "Admiralty test," and of
the sizes shown in the Table No. 23; and that after the 1st January,
1863, all chains supplied to ships be subject to the same regulations.
7. That such chains as will satisfactorily bear a strain of 10 per cent.
greater than the Admiralty proof for a chain of the full size for the
vessel's tonnage be allowed of the reduced sizes shown in the Table

8. That chains already made which will not bear the Admiralty test
mag be admitted in lien of lighter chains, according to the proof to
which they have been subjected. For example—a 2inch chain which
has been proved to the extent required by the Admiralty test for a
1½-in, chain may be admitted to serve as a 12-in, chain.
The above resolutions, so far as they relate to the weight of anchors,
will come into force, as a rule, at the end of six months from the pre¬

The regulations in regard to the testing of anchors and chain cables
will not be enforced until 1st January, 1863.
Copies of the Table No. 22, amended as above, may be had on appli
cation at this office, or from the surveyors at the several outports.

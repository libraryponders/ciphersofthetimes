. To the GENTLEMEN of the CITY of LONDON.
Gentlemen,
Beg to tender you my sincere thanks not only for
your kind appreciation of my unpretending little work entitled
"The Testament of the Law," and for your approval of a reform of the
law as advocated therein, but also for the kind sympathy and support
you recently extended to me when the propriety of my admittance at
an inn of court was taken into consideration by the Benchers of the
Society.
Without your powerful assistance it would have been impossible for
me to have attained that position in the profession which I now hold,
and altogether I feel that I owe you a debt of gratitude which can
never be repaid. The only return I can make (and this return I will
make) is to labour patiently on in the great cause of truth and justice.
Believeme to be, Gentlemen,
Yours very faithfully,
Oct 23, 1863.

WOU possess my most profound sympathy, especially
for a recent event intended partly to prevent the attainment of
your wishes, and in other respects for reasons all well-wishers de¬
voutly trust may not be true. Respect and esteem would return if
your word could be personally given that nothing had ever been done
to cause in any degree the rumours your conscience may or should
suggest, therefore keep a good heart; but why continue to hope under
existing circumstances to which you must be a party? Your thoughts
of past events, and lost opportunities which may be regretted, surely
can scarcely justify your saying "Trust me!" True manhood should
be trusting, but it should be reciprocated, and virtual promises and
engagements honourably fulfilled. Why should you again be trusted?
No: it cannot be without explanations and promises which only you
can give ; and it now remains for you to trustfully inform me of any
measures you intend to take which would make me keep a good heart
and hope ; in which case all would end as I am dying for.

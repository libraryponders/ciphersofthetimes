PROCLAMATION' by JAMES A. R. MENZIES,
Esq., Superintendent of the Province of Southland.—Whereas his
Excellency the Governor in Council has been pleased to delegate, under
the "Diseased Cattle Act, 1861," to the Superintendent of the Province
of Southland the several powers vested in the Governor by the 2d, 4th,
5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th sections of the said Act. subject to the regula¬
tions contained in the order in Council of 1st October, 1861;
And whereas, by a proclamation given under my hand, dated 2d
October, 1861, it was, amongst other things, declared that the inspector
was thereby prohibited from granting a certificate to land any cattle
imported from the colony of Victoria; and whereas it is expedient to
make further provision in that behalf
Now therefore, I, the said Superintendent, in virtue of the powers
vested in me, do hereby proclaim that the Inspector of Cattle under
the said Act shall not be authorised to grant a Certificate to land in
the Province of Southland cattle coming from any of the Australian
colonies, namely, Queensland, New South Wales (excepting as herein¬
after mentioned), Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and
Tasmania, from the date hereof: provided that cattle arriving in the
province of Southland from the port of Newcastle, in the colony of
New South Wales, in a vessel which shall have put to sea with
the same on or before the 24th of December current (and which
shall not thereafter have touched at the same, or at any other port,
until her arrival at a port within the province of Southland), shall
under the provisions of sub-section d, section 4, of the said Act, be
permitted to land upon the quarantine ground as the same has been
defined in the proclamation of 2d October, 1861, aforesaid, there to
remain until the said inspector shall permit the same to be removed
from thence ; the said quarantine ground being bounded on the west
by the Bluff Harbour, on the north by the eastern arm of the said har¬
bour, and by a right line extending due east from its eastern extremity.
until it intersects the east boundary of the Camphelltown Hundred, on
the east by the east boundary of the Campbeltown Hundred from the
said point of intersection to the sea coast, on the south by the occap.
Given under my hand, at Invercargill, this 26th day of December,
1861.
J. A. R. MENZIES, Superintendent.
The above proclamation has been republished from the Southland
Provincial Government Gazette of the 10th December, 1861 (with the
addition of a definition of the quarantine ground), in consequence of a
typographical error in the said proclamation, namely, "26th October,"
for "2d October."

FINDING that an erroneous impression prevails

of an ice and coffee shop, now carried on at the Adelaide Gallery, I beg
to state that I am not directly or indirectly interested in, and have no
control over, that business, or any other of a similar character. I con¬
sider it important to my interests that this should be understood, more
especially as I intend, at the earliest possible period, and so soon as I
can find premises fit for the purpose, to open an establishment to be
conducted on the same principle as the late Hungerford Hall, of which
I was the founder, and from which I was driven by the works now in
progress for the Charing-cross Railway.—CARLO GATTY

MOET and CHANDON's CHAMPAGNE.—Fraud
and Forgery of Brand.—Lightly and Simon, 123, Fenchurch¬
street, the London agents, beg to call the attention of the wine trade to
a FORGERY of the BRAND of the house, at present extensively prac¬
tised. The spurious wine is usually imported from Rotterdam, and is
in general worthless. The forged brand is an exact copy of the genuine
one.
RUINART (PERE et FILS) CHAMPAGNE.—
The above beg to CAUTION the trade and their numerous friends
against the forgery of their brand and wines which is extensively prac¬
tised. Judgments have already been given by French Courts against
the guilty parties. The house (established 1729) has always had the
same denomination of Ruinart (pere et fils), Rheims, Champagne.

CAUTION.—Whereas an INJUNCTION in Chancery has been

defendant and all others from selling or parting with sundry cases of
Rhenish wine, imported from Rotterdam, containing bottles bearing
imitation Duc de Montebello labels and corks, and further prohibiting
the importation or sale of all wines bearing such imitation labels or
corks, and whereas, in the cause "Duc de Montebello v. Jebens," tried
in the Tribunal Correctionel of Havre, a parcel of 250 cases, containing
3,000 bottles of wine, bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels and
corks, seized by the French Customs authorities (the said spurious wines
having been sent from Germany to Havre to be thence shipped to Eng
land, and thus, through the colourable importation from a French
port, to avoid detection on arrival here), were adjudged to be confis¬
cated, all persons are hereby cautioned against dealing with spurious
Champagnes bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels and corks.

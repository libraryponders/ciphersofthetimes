contents of such letter were otherwise surreptitiously ascertained, and
that information erroneously supposed to be deducible therefrom was
forthwith made use of for a most malignant and infamous purpose;
and whereas I am resolved to do everything in my power to bring the
authors of this diabolical outrage, or such of them as are still living, to
exposure and punishment;—I hereby offer the sum of £30 to any person
who recognising the authorship of this advertisement, from having been
concerned in the above, or any similar transaction relating to me, shall
furnish such evidence in respect thereof as will enable me to bring the
guilty parties to punishment. At the same time I wish it to be distiuctly
understood that this and previous advertisements on the same subject
are tentative only, and that, in the absence of certain, positive, legal
proof of the supposed facts, I throw no imputation upon any individual.

POLOGY.—Whereas the Commissioners in Lunacy
have intimated their intention to institute proceeding against
me, the undersigned, James Dore Blake, of Taunton, in the county of
Somerset, practising as a doctor of homeopathic medicine by virtue of
a degree in medicine granted to me by the Pennsylvanian College of
Homceopathic Medieme in Philadelphia, for having contrary to, and in
breach of the Lunacy Acts, unlawfully signed a certificate for the ad¬
mission of a lunatic into a house licensed for the reception of lunaties,
I not being a physician, surgeon, or apothecary registered under "The
Medical Act," passed in the Session of Parliament holden in the
twenty first and twenty-second years of the reign of Her present Ma¬
jesty, chapter ninety; and whereas, in consideration of the acknow¬
ledgment and apology hereinafter set forth, the said Commissioners
have, under the special circumstances of my case, consented to stay the
prosecution, now I, the said JAMES DORE BLAKE, do hereby
ACKNOWLEDGE that I have VIOLATED the LAW by signing such
certificate without being legally qualified so to do, and I do hereby ex¬
press my deep concern and regret for having so done; and do thus
publicly apologize for the same, and I do solemnly promise not again
to offend in like manner. —Dated this twelfth day of August, 1871.

CAUTION. -HOWARD's PATENT EASY CHAIRS
and SOFAS. The celebrity of these goods, which combine
luxurious comfort with perfection of workmanship, having caused in¬
ferior imitations to be offered for sale, the public are informed that all
those manufactured by us have a brass label attached, with number of
patent and address of patentees.—Howard and Sons, 26 and 27, Ber¬

CAUTION.—Ice Safes or Refrigerators. —The
WENHAM LAKE ICE COMPANY give natice that every
REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of their manufacture, bears their name
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felony.
This notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerous
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake 1ce Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬
sary complications, are unequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability,
and economy. Sole office, Wenham Lake Ice Company, 140, Strand.
CAUTION.—The only real purifier of water is the
SILICATED CARBON FILTER, which has been proved by the
Lancet Commission to be capable of removing the organic and saline

CARBON FILTER COMPANY, Church-road, Battersea, S.W.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE¬
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the
block ice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and deficious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any other ice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZING
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 3156, Oxford-street, London.
BETTS's CAPSULE PATENTS.—To prevent in¬
fringements, notice is hereby given, that BETTS's NAME is on
every capsule he makes for the principal merchants of England and
France, thus enabling vendor, purchaser, and consumer not only to
identify the genuineness of the capsules but likewise the contents of
the vessel to which it is applied. The Lord Chancellor, in his judg¬
ment on the 8th instant, said "that the capsules are not used merely
for the purpose of ornament, but that they are serviccable in protecting
the beer from injury and in ensuring its genuineness."—February 20.

SUITES, in 18 carat gold, machine made, as advertised, are only
to be procured at 37, Conduit-Street, Bond-street. Mr. STREETER
finds it necessary te make this announcement, as sets of ornaments,
stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their invoice.—

lords letting houses at rack rents will do well to inquire what
their investments will be worth under the "Lodgers' Goods Protection
Bill," now before Parliament, in cases where the immediate tenant is
cute enough to sublet, in which case the under tenant's goods will be
protected, and he will be able to hold on defiantly until ejected by legal
proceis, or compensated for vacating.

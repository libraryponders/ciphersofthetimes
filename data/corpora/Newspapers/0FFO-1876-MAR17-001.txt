hods for their
Detection, relative to the water used ty you m the brewing of your
justly celebrated ales. It appears, that in quoting at page 681, the
analysis made by Dr. Henry Bottinger of the water used in your
brewery, it is stated that it contains 765 grains of sulphate of zinc, in¬
stead, as it shourd be, 765 grains of smpnate of potash, and that this
has led to some very untortunate comments on the purity of your ates,
in "Nature" of last week. It is. of course, hardly necessary for me to
state that there is no trace of any such deieterious ingredent as sul¬
phate of zine to be found in your water, and that the sulphate of
potash, which is one of its natural ingredients, is pertectly harmless in
every way. No one can regret this mustake more than 1 do; but, as
some mitigation of it, and to show that it was not an intentional one,
1 beg to refer you to pagé 652 of the same book, in which 1 state dis¬
tinctty, that having subjected to a most careful analysis no loss than
40 samples of your bitter beer, I found them "to concist of the pro¬
ducts of malt and hops, and the constituents of pure spring water, no
other ingredient of any kind being discovered, ctner organic or in¬
organic," and that the above 40 samples " were procured undercircum¬
stances which precluded the possibinty of error, fallacy, of of prepara¬
tion for the setection." I will at once write to the Editor of "Nature,"
and ask him to be good enough to insert a copy of this letter, wuich
trust will be satisfactory to you, in his next number, ant you are of
course at liberty to make any further use of it that you may think
proper.—I am, Gentremen, Yours truly, Arthur H. Hassall.—Measrs.

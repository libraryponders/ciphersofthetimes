CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements appear daily, stating that the
advertisers can reproduce carte de visite portraits, I, CAMILLE
SILVY (as far as I am concerned), CAUTION all persons against such
proceedings, which infringe the acts for protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to se¬
cure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number) and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

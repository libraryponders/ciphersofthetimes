CAUTION.—In the matter of Fields' Parafine
Candles.—Whereas, Messrs. J. C. and J. FIELD, of Lambeth.
were the original manufacturers in England of PARAFFINE
CANDLES, and have, after a long and costly series of experiments
succeeded in producing paraffine candles free from colour, odour, and
greasiness; and whereas their process has been examined and favour¬
ably reported upon by scientific men of high repute, and has also been
noticed with approval in many of the public journals, and Messrs.
J. C. and J. Pield are now commonly considered the manufacturers of
paraffine candles; and whereas candles of inferior paraffine, and
candles composed in part only of paraffine, are being introduced into
the London and other markets under the designation of paraffine, and
it is apprehended the same may be confounded with the article manu¬
factured by Messrs. J. C. and J. Field, of Lambeth: Notice is hereby
given, that all persons desiring to purchase the paraffine candles manu¬
factured by Messrs. Field according to the process reported on by Dr.
Letheby (see Moncy Article in The Times of 8th January, 1862), should
be careful to procure them either in boxes or wrappers bearing the
names of "J. C. and J. Field, Lambeth;" and legal proceedings will
be taken against all persons offering to sell as "Field's Paraffine
Candles," candles not of their manufacture.—Dated this 24th day of
March. 1862.

COMMON COUNCIL, holden in the Chamber of
the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 26th day

That by the lamented decease of the Right Honourable the Earl
Canning, late Governor-General of India, this Court is prevented
from carrying into effect its unanimous resolution of presenting the
freedom of this city to that distinguished nobleman, and therefore
avails itself of the carliest opportunity of recording its deep sense of
the loss which the country has sustained by the premature death of
that able statesman, whose wise administration of the government of
India at a period of great peril, and subsequent measures of just and
enlightened policy, conciliated the affections and advanced the general
interests and prosperity of all classes of the population of that vast
and important possession of the British Crown, and that, in lasting
recognition by this Corporation of his eminent services, a bust of his
lordship be executed, at an expense not fexceeding 200 guineas, and

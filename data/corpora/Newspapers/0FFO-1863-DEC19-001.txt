THE Rev. W. WICKES, one of the Secretaries of
the Colonial and Continental Church Society, thinks it neces¬
sary to WARN the clergy and others against a person, travelling the
country, pretending to be furnished with letters of introduction from
Mr. W., representing himself as a clergyman, and as related to the
Bishop of Sodor and Man and Lord Lifford. He has already succeeded
in obtaining money by these false representations.
CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements have appeared stating that the
advertisers could now produce cartes de visites by photography at a low
price, I, CAMILLE SILVY, caution all persons against such pro¬
ceedings, which infringe the acts for the protection of property in works
of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs cannot
be obtained by this method, there being always a great difference be¬
tween a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to secure, at
any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them in perfect,
order from first to last (about 15,000 in number), and from these (plates
and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining proofs, either of
the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.—38, Porchester¬
terrace, Bayswater W.

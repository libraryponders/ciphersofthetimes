VITH reference to a Report of the Board of Trade
Inquiry that appeared in The Times of the 23d ut., having
reference to the loss of the Ellen Southard and the capsizing of the
Liverpool Lifeboat, belonging to the Mersey Dock Board, when 12
lives were lost, the sain boat was miscalled a tubular lifeboat. it will be
well that the public should know that there are only two tubular life¬
boats in the wo. i, and the Liverpool lifeboat is not one of them. The
two real tubb ars belong to the Royal National Lifecoat Institution,
and are stationed respectively at Rhyl and New Briguton. The said
boats have saved many lives, bat never lest one. Therefore, in justice
to R. T. Richardson and his late father, who mvented the real TUBU¬
LAR LIFEBOATs, including the one that yicked up the survvors
when the misea led tubular was floating bottom up, the public are
requested not t confuse the name, or to bracket the Liverpool poat
with the above-mentioned reas tubulars, which have saved 182 lives,
as well as assicted ave ressers without any accident whatever to their
crews.—H. T. RICHARDSON, Pwiluell, Nortn Wales.

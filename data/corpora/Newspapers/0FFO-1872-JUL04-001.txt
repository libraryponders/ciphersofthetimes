been induced to buy it, that to save them from total loss we will
allow 20s. per owt, for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entail a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up and sold

the article useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

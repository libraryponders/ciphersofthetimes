App
As the boundaries laid down on the Government Maps were pointed

tersons appointed by
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembled in Quarter Sessions, as
directed by the Acts of Parliament quoted above, the Maps may possi¬
bly become evidence respecting the Boundaries, and thus affect the
right of rating lands. Therefore proprietors, agents, and other per¬
sons to whom this notice is addressed, are particularly requested to
examine the Sketch Maps to ascertain that the Boundaries of those
Lands in and for which they are interested have be
correctly define d e
and laid down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for com¬
parison with the Boundary Sketch Maps,
at should any di

be found, they may be inquired into and corrected before the maps

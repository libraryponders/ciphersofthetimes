REWARD of ONE THOUSAND MARKS
(Hamburg currency).—The Engineer ROTHERHAM, born in
Norwich, was missed in St. Pauly (suburb of Hamburg), December
the 15th, 1857, and his supposed body found on April 27th, 1858, in the
Elbe, near Hamburg. The undersigned, whose house the above¬
named was in the habit of frequenting, was on suspicion brought to
trial, as his abode could not be found out, and the body which was
found four months later in the Elbe was looked upon as that of the
missing one. The result of this trial has not established the fact of a
murder, nor proved that the body found was that of the above¬
mentioned Rotherham. As it is, therefore, not improbable that the
above named engineer, Rotherham, is still alive, and in this case it
will be of great importance for me to ascertain this, I promise to every¬
body, being able to give me satisfactory explanation respecting the
stay or abode of Rotherham, or of the body found, the above named
reward of 1,000 marks. The same will be given even to the relations
of Rotherham who may be able to give me the required proof
respecting the actual residence of Rotherham, by testimonies of magis¬
trates or credible gentlemen.—T. H. C. BRANDES, 16 and 17, David¬
street, Hamburg, December, 1863.
PUBLIC APOLOGY.—Whereas an injunction has
been obtained by Messrs. Bass and Co., of Burton-upon-Trent,
brewers, to restrain me, the undersigned, EDWARD EDWARDS
COLLEY, late of No. 234, Upper Thames-street, London, publican,
from using or disposing of any of certain spurious or other labels
similar in design to, or only colourably differing from, Messrs. Bass
and Co.'s labels; and whereas Messrs. Bass and Co. have, upon my
appeal to them, consented to stay further proceedings upon my en¬
gaging, which I hereby do, not to repeat the offence, and to make this
public APOLOGY, with liberty to Messrs. Bass and Co. to insert it in
any London and local papers they may select. Dated this 4th day of

Witness, J. T. Coc.		EDWARD EDWARDS COLLEY.

CRINOLINE.—Messrs. JUSTINS and CARTER,
 Sheffield, have reason to believe that some unscrupulous
persons are endeavouring to Infringe upon Loft's Patent Covering
and Embossing Machines, of which they (Justins and Carter) are the
sole proprietors. They therefore wish to CAUTION the trade against
purchasing paper covered steel unless it bears their trade mark, and
at the same time to inform them that they will immediately commence
legal proceedings against all persons who are parties to such in¬

BISHOPSGATE WARD.—At a COURT of
WARDMOTE, holden at the school room, Bishopsgate church¬
yard, within the said Ward, on Monday, the 21st day of December
1863, before the Right Worshipful WILLIAM TAYLOR COPE.
LAND, M.P., Alderman of the Ward, for the purpose of ELECTING
WARD OFFICERS for the ensuing year, a poll was demanded for the
election of Common Councilmen. The Wardmote was consequently
adjourned to Tuesday, the 22d day of December inst., when the Alder¬
man declared the following to be the state of the poll:—
Mr. Richardson 236 Mr. Dadswell 0
Mr. Stapleton
 220
Mr. Fricker00
Mr. Deputy Owden...	..	216 Mr. Heeps.

Mr. Hopgood..	.... 204 Mr. Straker

Mr. Deputy Jones198 Mr. Richards0 010
Mr. Thomas	192 Mr. Edmiston 0 140
Mr. Kerry182 Mr. Dean.
124
Mr. Johnson174
The Alderman therefore declared the first named 14 gentlemen duly
elected.
It was moved by Mr. Brewer, seconded by Mr. Geddes, and unani¬
mously resolved:—
That this Wardmote view with dismay the possibility of the imposi¬
tion of a county rate in the city of London.
That there will be no security against the imposition of such rate by
the justices, if the pauper lunatic asylum, now in course of erection by
the Corporation, be, when completed, transferred to them.
That in other corporate towns and cities which have erected pauper
lunatic asylmmns no county rate can be levied by the justices for any
purpose connected with such asylums.
That, therefore, a memorial be presented to the Court of Common
Council embodying the preceding resolutions, and praying that the
Court will not transfer the building, when completed, to the justices,
but will take steps to save the citizens of London from the imposition
of a county rate by promoting a Bill in Parliament to provide that the
Corporation, having erected the lunatic asylum out of the city's cash,
shall have all the privileges in respect to the management thereof as
are conferred by the several Lunactic Asylums' Acts upon other cor¬
porate towns and cities in England.
It was moved by Mr. Swaebe, seconded by Mr. Rigby, and unani¬
mously resolved;
That this Wardmote, considering that taxation should be co-ex¬
tensive with representation, and feeling the inconsistency now exist¬
ing between the Courts of Common Council and the Commission of
Sewers, most urgently recommend to the support of their representa¬
tive the resclution of Mr. Medwin, proposed before the Court of Com¬
mon Council.
It was moved by Mr. Bartlett, seconded by Mr. Yerbury, and unani¬
mousy reolved;
That the best thanks of this Wardmote be given to the Deputies and
Common Council for the zeal and ability with which they have dis¬
charged their duties of office during the past year.
It was moved by Mr. Deputy Jones, seconded by Mr. Deputy Owden,
and unanimously resolved;
That this Wardmote desire to record the high sense they entertain of
the valuable services rendered to the Ward for so many years by the
Right Worshipful William Taylor Copeland, M.P., in his capacities of
Alderman and Senior Magistrate of the city of London. The Ward¬
mote also wish to expres, their gratitude for the great liberality with
which the charities of the Ward are supported by its Alderman, and
also for the regard he has always shown for the welfare of its poorer
inhabitants. The courtesy and impartiality which he has exercised
during this election, and which he equally evinces on the occasion of
all meetings of this Ward, deserve their best thanks, to which they
add their sincere wishes for his continued health and prosperity during
the coming year.
That the above resolutions be inserted in The Times, the Standard,
the Morning Advertiser, the Daily Telegraph, and City Press news¬

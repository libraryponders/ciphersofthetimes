CAUTION.—In the matter of Field's Paraffine

ably reported upon by scientific men of high repute, and has also been
noticed with approval in many of the public journals, and Messrs.

paraffine candles; and whereas candies of inferior paraffine, and
candles composed in part only of paraffine, are being introduced into

factured by Messrs. J. C. and J. Field, of Lambeth;—Notice is hereby
given, that all persons desiring to purchase the paraffine candles manu¬
factured by Messrs. Field according to the process reported on by Dr.

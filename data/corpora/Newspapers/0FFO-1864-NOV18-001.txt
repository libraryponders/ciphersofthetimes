THE FIRST COURT of MAYOR and ALDER¬
MEN holden in the Inner Chamber of the Guildhall of the city of
London on Tuesday, the 15th day of November, 1864, and in the 28th
year of the reign of Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland Queen, &c.,
Resolved unanimously, That, at the termination of the year of office
of the Right Hon. William Lawrence, late Lord Mayor of this city, this
Court has very great pleasure in recording its high opinion of the public
servicés rendered by him, and desires to convey to him its warmest
thanks for the admirable manner in which he has invariably discharged
the multifarious duties of his high and important office, maintaining its
dignity, dispensing liberally its hospitalities, and upholding on all
occasions the privileges of the city. This Court believes that the
citizens generally equally appreciate the manner in which these duties
have been performed, especially as the discharge of them was rendered
more arduous and difficult by the bereavement the late Lord Mayor
and his family sustained, in which this Court has truly sympathised
with them.

Mile-end-road, when and where all persons who by law are bound
to account at such audit are required to attend, and to submit all
books, documents, bills, and vouchers, containing or relating to the
accounts or to moneys assessed for, and applicable to, the relief of
the poor. —Dated the 16th day of November, 1864.

public and others are respectfully informed that the LONDON
BRANCH HOUSE is REMOVED from the temporary addresses,

CAUTION.—Fox's Frames for Umbrellas and

manufacturers of the Paragon Frame, and manufacturers of frames
made of solid steel wire, for UMBRELLAS and PARASOLS, beg
to invite notice to their label, which should be placed inside
each umbrella and parasol, and to caution dealers and the public
against imitations of their patent pebble tips. These imitations, which
are brittle and easily defaced, are being used by other persons to cause
inferior frames to resemble those manufactured by S. Fox and Co.,
by which a small extra profit may be made at the expense of the
durability of the umbrelia or parasol. S. Fox and Co.'s frames, made
of solid wire, are warranted not to lock together on opening the
umbrella or parasol, and, from the superior quality and temper of the
steel, will not snap or become bent in the use. They are charged one
penny per umbrelia or parasol more than the frames of other makers.
S. Fox and Co.'s patent pebble tips, being used only as a trade mark to
denote their special manufacture, are charged without profit. They
are of extreme strength and durability, and will last as long as the
frames.—S. Fox and Co., Deepear, near Sheffield, Oct., 1864.

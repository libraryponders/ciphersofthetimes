"London, June 16th, 1870.
Gentlemen.—I deeply regret having caused you the trouble
de.
fend your patent rights and to institute lega
cedeinigs against me¬
In compliance with the injunction which you have recently obtained,

of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed


also directed an account to be prepared of
your
all oeo,
ments I have made to the colonies up to the date of the
inijiunetion. These will, as speedily as
ossible, be furnished to you, as
well as a statemen e¬
taots that havben made by me in
contravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future

de
aue gest should be determined by some London or colonial
rchant to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
hope that you will do me the justice to believe that, previous to the
commencement of litigation between us. I sincerely thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact configuration described in your speci¬
fication and drawing attached to the patent. I, therefore, did not
imagme that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counsel
clanned it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such, I
now understand, consists in the formation of material into a garment.
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, so that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the knowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of damages, I have no
objection to your publishing this letter.

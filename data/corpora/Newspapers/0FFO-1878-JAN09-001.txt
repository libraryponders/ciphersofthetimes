TAXATION of SILVER PLATE.—"It is a well¬
known fact that the branches of procuction in which fewest
improvements are made are those with which the revenue officer in¬
terferes, and that nothing, in general, gives a greater impulse to im¬
provements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax
which narrowed the market for it."—John Stuart Mill's "Principles
of Political Economy." Buyers of silver plate need be under no ap¬
prehension that the abolition of the futy will in the slightest degree
affect Hall marking, beyend the withdrawal of the Queen's head or
duty mark. An effort will be made to obtain the REPEAL of the
DUTIES upon GOLD and SILVER PLATE in the next Session of
Parliament. For all statistical information application should be

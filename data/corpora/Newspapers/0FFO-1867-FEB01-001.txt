BSENT J. P. Same address as last, at Mr. C.'s,
 Anxious for a letter: WRITE at one
CARRUTHERS.—RECEIVED your LETTER


getting stronger now. Trusting you are wedl, with best wishes.
FRIEND,—Sudden embarrassments prevented
my acting as proposed in November, failing which, your pre¬
te
ived resolution concerning letters disabled me from sending that
which I had written. Misfortune has since overtaken mo, but mere
worldly misfortune falls lightly compared to the distress you know of.
You have, indeed, mistaken my nature. My letter would have been
better met by one kindly word; nor can Iforgive you for not letting
me know how you have been. As the first step towards acting as you
desired me for your sake to do, I am now acting as proposed in No¬

pelling misconceptions which must affiict you while they distress me
cruelly. Oh, never refuse to open letters. It would be a rash act, en¬
tailing such sorrows as you would be the first to deplore.—January 31.

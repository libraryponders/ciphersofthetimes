DUC de MONTEBELLO's CHAMPAGNES.—
Caution.—Whereas an INJUNCTION in Chancery has been
obtained in the cause "Duc de Montebello v. Gemmer," restraining
the defendant and all others from selling or parting with sundry cases
of Rhenish wine, imported from Rotterdam, containing bottles bear¬
ing imitation Duc de Montebello's labels and corks, and further prohi¬
biting the importation or sale of all wines bearing such imitation labele
or corks; and whereas, in the cause, "Duc de Montebellov. Jebens,"
tried in the Tribunal Correctionnel of Havre, a parcel of 250 cases,
containing 3,000 bottles of wine, bearing imitation Due de Montebello
labels and corks, seized by the French Customs' authorities (the said
spurious wines having been sent from Germany and Havre to be
thence shipped to England, and thus through the colourable importa¬
tion from a French port to avoid detection on arrival here), were ad¬
judged to be confiscated; all persons are hereby cautioned against deal¬
ing with spurious champagnes, bearing imitation Duc de Montebello

DUC de MONTEBELLO's CHAMPAGNES.—
Rt. SYMONDS and SON direct especial attention to the pre¬
cening CAUTION, as renewed attempts are being made to intro¬
duee spurious wines, bearing forged Duc de Montebello labels and
corks. These spurious wines are mestly imported via Rotterdam. The
genuine Duc de Montebello's Champagnes can be obtained of any re¬
spectable wine merchant in town or country.
CAUTION.—HARVEYS SAUCE. —Each bottle of
this celebrated sauce, prepared by E. LAZENBY and SON,
bears the label used so many years, signed "Elizabeth Lazenby."
CAUTION. — Mr. LIPSCOMBES CHARCOAL
FILTERS are the only ones that remove lead, lime, and sewage
from water, and that are self-cleaning. Prospectus free.—Temple-bar,
London. Last Patent, Jan. 6, 1869.
CAUTION.—Messrs. UNWIN and ALBERT, per¬
fumers to the Royal family, 24, Piccadilly, caution purchasers of
AURICOMUS FLUID against imitations of their registered article
for Golden Hair, Paris, Joues, 23, Boulevard des Capucines; Florence,
Roberts, 17, Via Tornahuon; Scot.
aend, Sturrock and Sous, Glasgow.
CAUTION.—Water Filtration.—Before purchasing
filters the public is advised to read "Water, its Impurities and
Purification," price 2d., per post 3d. (to the medical and clerical pro¬
fessions gratis), as the majority of so-called filters are worse than use¬
es. Of the vital importance of pure water see leading article in
The Times of July 31st. The only substance which removes organic
t and other poisonous ingredients in water is animal charcoal, with
 which this Company's patent cistern and other filters are solely filled,
bly ; The Registrar-General, Sir Win. Jenner, and the élite of the medical
profession have adopted the patent cistern filters, which can only
of had in London at the LONDON and GENERAL WATER-PURIFY¬
ING COMPANY'S depot, 157, Strand, four doors from Somerset¬
house, where the filters can be seen in operation, and full particulars
obtained. These filters can be rented in London the same as gas-meters,
from £1 to £1 10s. per annum. Upwards of 1,000 are now rented.
CAUTION.—The Directors of the manufactory "La
Ferme," carrying on business in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw,
and Dresuen, have discovered that certain persons nave, notwithstand¬
ing the protection of trade marks by Prussian law, attempted to bring
into the market an imitation, La FERME CIGARETTES, in
wrappers strikingly similar to those used by the original firm.
In order to protect the public from fraud, the Directors make known
the following points by which the two wrappers may be distinguished:
—On the wrappers which have been in use for 18 years at the manufac¬
tories, "La Ferme," in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw, and Dresden,
there is written above the Russian eagle "Recu, 1868," above the Paris
medal "Premer prix," and above the Chemnitz medal "Hors
concours." The inscription on both medals is perfectly legible be¬
sides, there is "Fabrique die Tubacs et Cigarettes." "La Ferme," à St.
Petersburg; "Persp de Nevsky," à Moscow; "Pont de Morech,"
Varsovie et à Dresde dans sa propre maison, On the other hand,
some of the imitations nave also the Russian eagle and the prize
medals of both the Paris and the Cnemnity exhibitions, and above the
eagle "Foudi, 1867," and above the prize medals, on which the inscrip¬
tion is not legable, there is "Premier qualite, an¬
the following in¬
scription:—"Fabrique de cigarettes, et ne tabac.
La Ferme," vend
a St. Petersburg, à Moscou, à Odessa, à Varsovie, à Dresde et a Berlin
dans propre maison.
The Directors ascertained also that certain commercial travellers
have taken orders in the name of the original firm; they therefore give
notice that they never had, or ever intend to have, travellers, where¬
fore all such offers from travellers, to persuade persons to buy other
goods resembling those of the "La Ferme" manufactory, must be looked
upon as attempts to defrand. They would be very thankfal for any in¬
formation about such persons, in order to put an end to such wrongful

Besue the imitation above referred to there are two others one
called "La Terne," and the other "Lamberd." The public who wish
to pe secured from such mtations are requested either to apply to the
firm "La Ferme," of Dresden, or to other weleknown houses, who only
seil the genuine artiole (in London, Messrs. Adolph Frankan and CO.,
No. 72, Wood-street).

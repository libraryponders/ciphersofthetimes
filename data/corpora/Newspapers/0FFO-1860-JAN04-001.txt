SERTED in the "West London Observer" of the 17th day of Decem¬
ber. 1859, a LETTER, reflecting on Mr. Weaver, of Walham-green, on
account of a statement made by him at a Meeting of the Fulham

nating from the Chapel in Waterloo-street, and whereas, upon inquiry,
we consicer that we were not warranted in the expressions therein
sessae¬
Mr. Wesver for the expressions made use of and of which he has
complained to us, as we feel assured that Mr. Weaver acted only in the
discharge of his duty in his communication to the Board of Works, and
that an escape of gas from the meter in the chapel, and at the gate
leading into the chapelyard, of which the Trustees of the chapel were
unaware, warranted the statements made by Mr. Weaver, and we do
hereby retract the statements and observations made by us reflecting
on Mr. Weaver's character and integrity.

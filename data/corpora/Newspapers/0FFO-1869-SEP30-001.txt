CAUTION.—The Pall-mall Jewel Case.—Messrs.
HOWELL, JAMES, and Co. beg respectfully to caution the
public that they ure the sole patentees and manufacturers of the newly¬
invented PALL-MALL JEWEL CASE, the chief characteristics of
which will recommend themselves as a ready deposit and safeguard to
valuable property. In the construction of the case the greatest sim¬
plicity and portauility have been observed, coupled with the utmost
secrecy and consequent security to the contents. It is fire-proof; and,
in discarding the hitherto shapened receptacles for the several articles,
the case is anapted to fit any jewel without the fear of the slightest
injury.—Howed, James, and Co., Regent-street, Pall-mall.
CAUTION.—Water Filtration. —Before purchasing
filters the public is advised to read "Water, its Impurities and
Purification," price 2d., per post 3d. (to the medical and clerical pro¬
fessions gratis), as the majority of so-called filters are worse than use¬
less. Of the vital importance of pure water see leading article in
The Times of July 31st. The only substance which removes organie
and other poisonous ingredients in water is animal charcoal, with
which this Company's patent nistern and other filters are solely filled.
The Registrar-General, Sir Wm. Jenner, and the elite of the medical
profession have adopted the patent cistern filters, which can only be
had in London at the LONDON and GENERAL WATER-PURIFY.

obtained. These filters can be rented in London the same as gas-meters,
from £1 to £1 16s. per annum. Upwards of 1,000 are now rented.
CAUTION.—The Public are warned against the
trashy attempts of those w seek as near as they dare to copy
the design of Messrs. D. NICOLL and Co.'s PATENTED GAR¬
MENTS, and particularly with regard to the dual garment called
the Rug Paletot. Unprincipled persons, who have only suddenly
awakened to the advantage of this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to sell mere rubbish for
that which D. Nicoll and Co. have already  roved to be the cheapest
guinea's worth ever offered to the public. The shelter of patent rights
in respect to cost is therefore not claimed by D. Nicoll and Co, as in
fact the trashy imitations referred to could without difficulty be sold
at half-a-guinea, but the safeguard to the public will be their right to
demand to see the trade mark, which may be thus described:—the
Coats of Arms of London and Paris are printed or woven on to a
loop used for hanging up the garment, and between these omblems
of the two cities, the words "Nicoll's Patent" appear. INFORMA¬
TION as to INFRINGEMENT should be sent to 6, Fell-Street, Wood¬

HYDROPULT.—Caution. —Devices in imitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are caiculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. The pro¬
prietor, therefore, issues this caution, and respectfully intimates that
parties wishing to purchase the hydropult should examine the machine
offered for sale, and see if it has attached thereto a label, with the fol¬
lowing words:—"The Hydropult, Vose's Patent, manufactured only
by Griffiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles Pomeroy Button,
proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London." Unless this label is
attached the machine is not the hydropult. Hydropults weigh but 81b.,
and will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet wheh worked by the power of one man. Hydropults will draw
water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose, and
force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. Hydro¬
pults can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or force pump is
applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances are useless.
The hydropult has been recommended as an efficient and useful fire¬
engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of Great
Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department as
fire engines. Robert Hogg. LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibbard, Esq.
F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other well¬
known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable garden
implement. The hydropult has been recommended by the Gardeners'
Chronicle, Journal of Horticulture, Gardeners Magazine, Daily Tele¬
graph, Liverpool Daily Post, Commercial Daily List, Illustrated News
of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Magazine, City Press,
Insurance Gazette, and other first class journals throughout Great
Britain. An illustrated prospectus, with testimonials, free on applica¬

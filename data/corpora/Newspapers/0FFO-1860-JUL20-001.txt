COLUMN of ye-terday.—F. M. S.
MULY 17.—Addressed M. J. M. What do you
advise? Name a place.
IF R. A. B., who left Perivale Rectory, on Wednes¬
dey last, will COMMUNICATE with his Aunt Julia, all will be
aranged and forgiven. He is earnestly implored to remember his
mother.
WHEN my Father and my Mother forsake me
the Lord taketh me up. Pray WRITE if you are in trouble.
Give full particulars. State your wants. Give exact address. Shall f
write to where you were?
.W...I returned at the time I mentioned
expecting every day either to see you or receive a letter stating
vry particular as to when and where our business was to be settled.
Pray attend to my request. Yours ever.—London, 18th.
MILLIAM.—RECEIVED. Thank you. Will not
your friend do the same favour again? and ack a reply. It is
most important to communicate by letter. You must take the advice
given in my last—say "I won't go;" resist to the utmost—they dare
not resort to brute ferce. Be firm. If you once go all will be lost.
Try to send me the exact address. A letter shall be sent in the same
name to the office in your village. God bless you. Help is at hand.—
JAMES.

MARIA.—Dearest Wife,—I hope you are well.
I am as well as the circumstances will permit. Dearest, you
must demand your liberty, and do so at once. Insist upon going where
and when you please. Do not allow them to take you away—they have
no right to keep you in a state of false imprisonment, nor to exercive
any power over you, now that you are of age. Write to me to the
same afdress, and take care to post it yourself—tell me how to write to
you, and where. I will make them set you at liberty by the strong arm
of
law. God bless you
dearest wife. Your ever true and affec¬
tionate Husband, EDWARD.

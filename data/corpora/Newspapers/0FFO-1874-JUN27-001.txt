General Post-office, Cape Town, 24th April, 1874.
By the Royal Mall packet Nyanza a very large number of etters was
received, evidently posted to come by the Wahner Castle, with the post¬
age upon them fully prepaid if sent by the Donald Currie Line; but
not being specially marked to go "by private steamer," "by Walmer
Castle," or "by Donald Currie Line," they were reserved by the home
postal authorities to be sent by the Royal Mall packets, and each oc
them subjected accordingly to an additional charge of 1s. 6d. postage
upon delivery. From the annexed extract of a letter from the Secre.
tary, General Post-office, London, it will be seen that this is the treat¬
ment adopted with every letter not specially marked as to the mode of
trannnission. The public here are accordingly requested to warn their
correspoudents in England to be careful to marx their letters designed
to be sent by the Donald Currie Line, either generally "by private
steamer," or by the particular vessel leaving England at the time of
posting, and to follow the same course in regard to their newspapers
when they desire to receive them by the lonald Currie Line.

not being accepted as an indication of the wish of the senders. As the
letter addressed to Dr. W. H. Ross. Cape Town, was not specially ad¬
dressed to be forwarded by private ship, it was correctly treated in
this office in being forwarded by packet and charsed according

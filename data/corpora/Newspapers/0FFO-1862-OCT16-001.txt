SPECIAL and urgent APPEAL on behalf of the
REFUGE for HOMELESS and DESTITUTE BOYS, 4, Man¬
sell-street, Whitechapel, E. Established 1854. The Committee, grateful
to the public for their kind sympathy and assistance hitherto given,
again plead for more help. The last half-year's accounts show liablli¬
ties to the amount of £175; to pay off these, and to secure funds to
carry on the Institution during the ensuing winter months, this appeal

The Refuge is certified under the Industrial Schools Act, and its
objects are to provide a home and work for destitute boys attending

The employments are blacking making, brush making, and shoe
blacking in the streets, affording employment to upwards of 120 poor
boys, who, without the help thus given, would be probably living in
misery and crime ; owing, however, to want of funds, the numbers
must (if assistance is not afforded) be greatly reduced. The Com¬
mittee state that the usefulness of this Institution has been very great,
it being situate in the east of London, where vice and misery greatly
abound, but where a visit from the wealthy is rarely known; the assist¬
ance derived from the immediate neighbourhood is very limited. The
easemesen
made in vain to those whom God has blessed with the means of assist¬
ing their poorer suffering fellow-creatures.

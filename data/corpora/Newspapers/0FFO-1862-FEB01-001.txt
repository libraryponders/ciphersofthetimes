NEXT of KIN of THOMAS CHURCHILL, late
of Chertsey, Surrey, blacksmith, who died about the year 1782.—
There is a sum of money invested in the Three per Cent. Consols in the
names of Trustees, held under certain trusts declared in and by three
several deeds dated respectively the 7th April, 1780, the 22d May, 1781,
and the 1st May, 1783, including trusts for Elizabeth, the sister of the
said Thomas Churchill (supposed to have died many years ago, unmar¬
ried), for her life and for her children (if any), for their lives, and in¬
cluding trusts which expired on the 15th day of March, 1860, with an
ultimate trust for the said Thomas Churchill, his executors, adminis¬
trators, and assigns. The said Thomas Churchill died intestate about
the year 1782, and his widow, Ann Churchill, obtained letters of admi¬
nistration to his effects. He is supposed to have left him surviving his
said widow, Ann Churchill, since deceased; his mother, Elizabeth
Churchill, since deceased; and his half-sister Dorothy, the wife of
Richard Smith, of Chertsey, surgeon, since deceased; but it is not
known for certain whether his said sister, Elizabeth Churchill, or any
issue of her survived the said Thomas Churchill. It is supposed that
Ann Churchill, the widow of
Thomas Churchill, married again about
the year 1800 to a Mr. Hull, and that she resided at Ilton, near Ilmin¬
ster, Somersetshire, from that time till her death, in or about the year
1804. And the Trustees hereby give notice, that they intend to pay the
fund into the Bank of England, pursuant to the Trustee Relief Act, in
the matter of the tr.
of the said three indentures; and all
trsons
who claim to be entitled to the said trust fund as NEXT of KIN of
the said THOMAS CHURCHILL, or as representing the said Ann
Churchill, Elizabeth Churchill, the mother, Dorothy Smith and Eliza¬
beth Churchill, the sister, or who claim to be the said Elizabet),
Churchill, the sister, or any of her issue, should make their claims in
the Court of Chancery; and all proper information for that purpose
will be furnished by Mr. Henry G. Grazebrook, of Chertsey, Surrey,
solicitor to the Trustees.

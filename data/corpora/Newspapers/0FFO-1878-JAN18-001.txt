provements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax
which narrowed the 
ket for it."—John Stuart Mill's "Principlés
of Political Economy." Buyers of silver plate need be under no ap¬
prehension that the abolition of the duty will in the slightest degree
affect Hall marking, beyond the withdrawal of the Queen's head or
duty mark. An offort will be made to obtain the REPEAL of the

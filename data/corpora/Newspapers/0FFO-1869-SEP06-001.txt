JAMES CUNDY, Chairman.
JOHN PIKE, Hon. Sec.
AT a MEETING of the POLICY-HOLDERS of the
ALBERT INSURANCE ASSOCIATION, called by the Offi¬
cial Liquidator, at the Free Trade-hall, this morning, the following
resolution was passed unanimously:—
"That this Meeting of Policy-holders (in the Albert Insurance
Company), resident in Manchester and district, feels bound to ex¬
press its opinion, that for several years past the management of the
Company in London has been conducted in the most reckless and ex¬
travagant manner, and seeing that since 1862 the losses have amounted
to nearly 1 millions, they cannot but censure in the strongest pos¬
sible manner the entire Board of Directors, but especially the late and
present Manager of the Company; nor will it have any confidence
whatever in the liquidation of the affairs of the said Company as long
as Mr. Kirby remains in the position even of a temporary provisional¬
liquidator; and further, it hopes that every means available will be
used to bring to a proper tribunal the parties guilty in the said reck
less mana e e e,

plicity and portability have been observed, coupled with the utmost
secrecy and consequent security to the contents. It is fire-proof; and,

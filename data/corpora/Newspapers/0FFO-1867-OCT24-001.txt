CHATWOOD's Invincible "Intersected" STEEL
BANK SAFE, which so successfully stood the test against the
American Safe at the Paris Exhibition, for £1,200, received the only
Prize Medal awarded to Great Britain for safes. Samuel Chatwood,
bankers safe and lock engineer, patentee.
Extracts from Official Report of the English Engineers of the Safe
Testing Committee, Paris Exposition, 1867:—
"It is to be remarked that while Herring's safe was fairly attacked
in front, and opened in front, Chatwood's safe proved impossible to be
broken into by the front."
"The weight of tools actually brought into operation was largely in
favour of Herring, being—Herring's men, 2421b.; Chatwood's men,
1571b. ; and the entire weight nearly of Herring's tools were employed,
hereas at least 401b, of Chatwood's tools were never used at all"
"Chatwood's safe gives a figure of value, as comp ared with Herring's,
of 1985'625, or, in round numbers, as 3 to 1."
"In point of accommodation, as compared with weight, bulk, and
cost, Chatwood's safe is three times as good as Herring's."
"The material of Chatwood's safe, taken as a whole, is much supe¬
rior to Herring's. The former has no cast iron in its outer or inner
casings, but much more and better applied steel enters into its fabric."
"Uvon a review, then, of all the facts of the case, we are of opinion
that Mr. Chatwood's is the best safe, "in its capability of resisting
burglars appliances of any kind, and that Mr. Chatwood is justly
entitled to the challenge stakes."

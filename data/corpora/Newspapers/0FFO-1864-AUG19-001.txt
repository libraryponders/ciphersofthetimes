CAUTION.—Fox's Frames for Umbrellas and Para¬

solid steel wire for UMBRELLAS and PARASOLS, beg to invite
notice to their label, which should be placed inside each umbrelia and
parasol, and to caution dealers and the public against imitations of
their patent pebble tips. These imitations, which are brittle, and
easily defaced, are being used by other persons to cause inferior frames
to resemble those manufactured by S. Fox and Co., by which a small
extra profit may be made, at the expense of the durability of the
umbrella or parasol. S. Fox and Co.'s frames, made of solid wire, are
warranted not to lock together on opening the umbrella or parasol,
and, from the superior quality and temper of the steel, will not snap,
nor become bent in the use. They are charged 1d. per umbrella or
parasol moré than the frames of other makers. S. Fox and Co.'s patent
pebble tips, being used only as a trade mark to denote their special
manufacture, are charged without profit. They are of extreme strength
and durability, and will last as long as the irames.—S. Fox and Co.

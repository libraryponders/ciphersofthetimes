prayed for you earnestly.—Your own little Wife.
WE can't help " disturbing ourselves" about you. For
dod's sake drop us a line now and then. Why should we forget
you?

lighted. Much improved, and hope to hear the same of you
next time.
—You make me very unhappy. I'm afraid it is
what I have been told—only a question of money. I can pay
my own expenses, not yours, and a richer person might suit you
better. It would make us both misers

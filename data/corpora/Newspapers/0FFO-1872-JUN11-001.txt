in calling the attention of the trade to a recent decision in the
House of Lords, in the case of "Wotherspoon y Currie," whereby their
exclusive right to the use of the word "Glenfield' in connexion with
Starch is indi-putably established, would also intimate that this deci¬
sion renders the sale of the starch made by the defendant illegal, and
will subject the seller of it to a penaity of £10,000. We beg inti¬
mate to those who may have been induced to buy it, that to save
them from total loss we will allow 20s, per cwt. for it at the Glen¬
field Starch Works, Paisley, in exchange for the genuine asticle,
at the current price. This will entail a loss upon ouirselves, as the
packets will be broken up and sold for waste starch, but it will at the
same time be the means of rendering the article useless for further d.
ception. Any information that will lead to conviction will be re¬
warded.

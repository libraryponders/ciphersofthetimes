PUBLIC APOLOGY.—"Stone v. Stevenson."—
Exeter, July 28, 1863.—To Captain T. H. Elphinstone Stone.—
Sir.—It being now ascertained that the information on which I relied,
when addressing Mr. Wayett the letter the subject of the action for
libel brought by you against me, and now pending, is erroneous—that
you are prepared with evidence to refute the charges made against
your character in that letter, and that you are desirous to produce in
Court such evidence, and to submit yourself as a witness to confirm it,
and also to meet any other charge to your prejudice that may be made
—and you having also shown, that when you on some late occasion
apparently did not, with sufficient epergy, repel affronts offered to you.
that you were at the time under the constraint of your legal advisers,
to forbear to the utmost, as any personal violence on your part would
prejudice your position in a divorce suit then pending and involving
your deepest interests—I dosire to withdraw the letter above referred
to, and all justification for it; that all further proceedings in the action
may be stayed on my paying the costs you have incurred in respect to
it (by agreement assessed at £150); and I also withdraw every other
charge I may have made to your prejudice as an officer and a
man.	 I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JOHN N. STEVENSON.
Exeter, 28th July, 1863.
To J. N. Stevenson, Esq.—Sir, I acknowledge

pending between us. Yours, T. H. Elphinstone Stone, Captain 1st

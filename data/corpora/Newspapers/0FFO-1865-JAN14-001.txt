MESSRS. JOSEPH and JOHN VICKERS and

tions of their new distillery in Victoria-street, Westminster, was laid
on Monday, the 2d day of January, and every effort will be made to

MARTIN MAYLARD, 95 and 96, High-street,
Borough, in RETIRING from BUSINESS, begs to return his
sincere thanks to his numerous friends and customers for their long¬
contined favours, and to inform them that he has transferred his stock
and business to Capper, Son, and Co., of Gracechurch-Street, to whom
he begs that all debts due to him may be paid.
We beg to notify that the whole remainder of Mr. Maylard's stock
has been removed to our premises, and will be offered, at a great reduc¬
tion from the original cost, on Thursday, the 12th of January, and fol¬
lowing days, with our usual new year's clearance of last season's goods
—silk and other dresses, French shawls, flannels, table linen and sheet¬
ings, lace shawls and cambric handkerchiefs, muslin works of all
kinds, hosiery and gloves.—Capper, Son, and Co., Iinendrapers by ap¬
pointment to the Queen and to the Prince of Wales, 69 and 70, Grace¬
church-street, and 169 and 170, Fenchurch-street.
TO UMBRELLA and PARASOL DEALERS and
the PUBLIC.—The remarkable durability of the PARAGON
FRAMES for UMBRELLAS is exemplified by a fact which has re¬
cently come to the knowledge of SAMUEL FOX and Co., viz: that
these frames are frequently taken out of old umbrellas and put into
new ones, and the extent to which this is done by some manufac¬
turers compels the patentees, Samuel Fox and Co., to notice it, and
to invite particular attention to their tabel, having their trade mark as
well as their name, which they issue only with new frames, and which
should be placed inside each umbrella or parasol. Samuel Fox and
Co.'s frames, made of solid steel wire, are warranted in every way; they
are charged one penny per umbrelia or parasol more than the frames
of other makers. Samuel Fox and Co.'s patent pebble tips are used
as an additional mark to denote their special manufacture, they are
charged without profit, and are of extreme strength and durability,
and will last as long as the frames; the various imitations of these
tips also necessitates reference to the label of S. Fox and Co. —Deepcar,
near Sheffield, January, 1865.

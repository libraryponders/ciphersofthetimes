TO PARLIAMENTARY and LEGAL PRINTERS
and others.—Re Judicature Acts and Rules.—It being evident
that the allowance made for printing under the above Acts and Rules
has been made in error inasmuch as it is totally inadequate in the
majority of instances, 1 have commubicated with some of the leading
houses in out trade on the subject, and, almost without exception,
they agree with me that someching should be done, and at once, to
remedy the evil at present existing. I foel assured that it is only ne¬
cessary to present this mater in its right light, in the proper quarter,
to obtain an alteration of the rules: as it is only fair to assuime that
the law-makers had no intention of injuring our trade, and that some
error of calculation has been made which only requires a little eluci¬
dation to be set right. I have determined, therefore, to call
MEETING of the trade generally, and have fixed Monday, the 6th
inst., at 3 p.m., at the Arbitration Room of the Inns of Court Hotel
(Lincoln's-Inn-fields entrance), for the purpose of holding such meet¬
ing, and I shall feel much obliged to all who will kindly attend. I
propose moving at the Meeting the following resolution,—
"That this Meeting finding that the allewance made to printers
under the Judicature Acts and Rules is totally inadequate in the
majority of instances, resolves that a memorial be presented to the
Lord High Chancellor of Great Rritain and to the other judges of the
Supreme Court of Judicature, setting forth the grievances of the said
printers, and praying relief therefrom."

NOTICE. — Some weeks ago a paragraph appeared in
the Doncaster Chronicle identifying the notorious Madame
Rachel (whose real name is Leverson) with Mrs. J. L. Levison, who
formerly resided in Doncaster with her husband, that gentleman being
for some time a respectable practitioner here as a surgeon-dentist. We
are assured there is not one word of truth in the information furnished
us, and we take this our earliest opportunity of giving the statements

to Mr. Levison our most sincere APOLOGY that statements reflect¬
ing so seriously and unwarrantably upon Mrs. Levison and himself
should ever have found publicity in our columns. We can only express
our deep regret that it should have been so, and assure him that it was
through no personal or malicious feeling that those statements were
made. We must respectfully request that any newspaper having in¬
serted the e e
th referred to will alse give effect to this apology by
repeating the contradiction.—(Signed) HARTLEY and SON, Pro¬

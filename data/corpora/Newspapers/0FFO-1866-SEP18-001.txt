previous edition of this catalogue was published as a contribution to¬
wards the supply of this desideratum, and, as it met with so much suc¬
cess and so many expressions of approbation, Messrs. Cox and Son
have been induced to publish this new and enlarged edition, with a
great number of new engravings. As the designs here illustrated are
executed at Messrs. Cox and Son's own workshops, they can combine
economy of production with excellency of workmanship and material.

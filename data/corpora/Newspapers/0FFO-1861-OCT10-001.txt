The utmost confidence may be strictly relied upon.
MY dear SISTER.—I have already said I could not
leave this place till early in November. How I wish I could
Bay I was better. I begin almost to despair, and have consulted many.
When I return I hope to see you ; if that is not possible I shall remain
here longer. Ever, B. I.—Home, 8th.
DELLA, St. Mary's, must see G. H., or hear from
them immediately. Something must be settled before the winter.

adopt. Make an advance, it is an effort, but will eventually prove the
best for all. Parties surrounded by enemies. Don't hesitate. Inevi¬
table ruin is the result.

and the Trade generally. — Whereas it having come to the knowledge of
Messrs. Hutton and Co., of Newgate-street, London, who are the sole
lecencees and manufacturers of the patented umbrella, that some parties
are manufacturing this important and popular article, and vending the
patented furniture for purposes of manufacturing into rotary umbrellas
contrary to the knowledge and will of the said Hutton and Co., and
to their detriment, this is to give notice, that any person or persons
selling the patent rotary umbrella, parasol, or sunshade so infringed,
are liable to legal proceedings being instituted against them in the
Court of Chancery; and further, that persons imitating the said rotary
umbrelia will be likewise proceeded against in law and equity. The
trade and the public should, therefore, be very cautious that they purchase
the patent rotary umbrella, manufactured by HUTTON and Co., who
are sole manufacturers and licencees of the above patent. —Sept., 1861.

COPY of ADDRESS presented to ROBERT
MURRAY, Commander of the Aberdeen clipper liner Damas¬

Sir.—We, the undersigned passengers by the ship Damascus, from
Sydney, to London, desire, previous to our disembarkation, to express
the sense we entertain of your judicious, zealous, unwearied, and care¬
ful attention to the safety of the ship and her freight, and the preser¬
vation of the many lives committed to your charge, especially evinced
during an unusually arduous passage through ice extending over no less
than 71 degrees of longitude and six degrees of latitude, and besetting
the ship's path through that perilous region ahead, and on either side,
stee
We witnessed with admiration, but yet with painful concern, on account
of its necessity, that you passed 11 whole consecutive nights on deck on
the watch, for the general safety, at a time when the thermometer
ranged no higher than the treezing point, sometimes lower, and during
one whole night so low as 22 degrees of Fahrenheit; while, at the same
time, by your cheerfulness and energy, you gave confidence and
courage to us all. Of such services we feel the value, but they are
above all price.
Secondly, we thankfully acknowledge the frank and seamanlike
attention shown to us all.
We have now happily concluded a nowise ordinary voyage, under no
ordinary circumstances, and consider that, under Divine Providence,
wo owe our best thanks to you, your excellent officers, and crew for the
precautions with which we have been guarded and the comforts by
which we have been surrounded. We accordingly offer to you, and to
them through you, our hearty and cordial thanks. Their services we
highly estimate, the remembrance of them will be long retained by us:
we have but one regret, namely, that we cannot reward them as they

We. however, beg you to accept from us a small purse, the contents
of which you may apply to some purpose of your own choice, which
shall remind you in after days of

Your faithful and obliged friends,

Ladies and Gentlemen,—I beg to tender you my best thanks for
the very kind address you have now presented to me, at the conclusion

 feel great pleasure in knowing the good opinion you entertain of
myself, the officers and crew of the Damascus. I will devote the con¬
tents of the purse as you desire, and, although unable to express my
thanks asf could wish, yet belicve me I fully appreciate the extreme
kindness shown by you, not only on this occasion but throughout the
voyage.
Accept my kindest wishes to all, and it is with sincere regret that I
must now say, farewell. Your's most respectfuil

MR. JOHN S. RAREY has the honour to an¬
nounce to the nobility, clergy, gentry, and inhabitants of London
ssanesse¬
arrangements to give a SERIES of EIGHT FAREWELL LEC¬
TURES, which will positively be the last in London, practical and
demonstrative, upon his system of subduing wild and vicious horses.
Mr. Rarey has just returned from an extended tour througn Egypt,
Arabia, and the Holy Land, where he had opportunities of gathering
much information regarding the horse, which will be imparted, adding
materially to the interest of the forthcoming exposition. Several
extremely vicious subjects have already been secured, and no efforts
will be spared to make these demonstrations more interesting than
any Mr. Rarey has ever given. At the suggestion of several infinential
friends, the prices of admittance will be at the following reduced
rates:—First class (secured seats), 10s.; second, 5s.; third, 2s. 6d.
The series will commence at the Royal Alhambra Palace, on Monday,
May 21, at 8 p.m.; continuing on Tuesday, May 22, at 2 and 8 p.m.; on
Wednesday, May 23, at 8 a.m.; on Thursday, May 24, at 8 p.m.; on
Friday, May 25, at 8 p.m.: and on Saturday May 26, at 2 and 8 p.m.
Seats can be secured and tickets taken at Mitchell's Royal library,
No. 33, Old Bond-street; and at the Alhambra Palace.
RAREY's FAREWELL DEMONSTRATIONS.—

nour to announce that he will give a SERIES of EIGHT LEC¬
TURES, Practical and Demonstrative, upon his SYSTEM of SUBDU¬
ING WILD and VICIOUS HORSES, which will positively be the last in
London previous to his departure for America and final retirement.
1t is confidenrly expected that these lectures will surpass in interest
any that Mr. Rarey has ever given. Having just returned from an ex¬
tended tour through Arabia and the East, he will be able to impart
much valuable information, gathered while absent, relative to the
horse, which will add materially to the interest of the forthcoming ex¬
positions. Letters have been received from different sections of the
country, from owners of vicious horses, challenging Mr. Barey to test
his process in public, implying doubt of his ability to subdue them. Mr.
Rarey's confidence in his system being unbounded, he has accepted not

chalenges, e 
te to sublue any

tra.
orse n
matter how vicious and ungovernable it may be.

above, other noted vicious horses have been sed¬

RAREY.—Vicious, Horses.—Mr. RAREY being
anxious to procure the most VICIOUS HORSES possible for

who will secure such subjects for him. Communications addressed

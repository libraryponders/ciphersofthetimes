contributor to a current journal of female fashions and light literature,
by vague advertisements, promising weekly sheets of a novel from her
pen to its subscribers, that she knows nothing whatever of the paper
or its publisher; that she has examined the portion of one of her
novels given there, and finds it to be an imperfect reprint (wanting the
dedication) from the 19th volume of the well-known Parlour Library,
published 20 years ago, with her sanction, by Sims and McIntyre, of
Belfast, and afterwards by Thomas Hodgson, of Paternoster-row, at the
price of eighteen pence the volume. She has given no permission for an
inferior re-issue; on the contrary, a superior one-volumed edition is in
course of publication, with a portrait of Mrs. Norton by Sir Edwin
Landseer, and vignette of Scottish scenery, being the only new edition
authorised by her, and the first volume of a series of her reprinted
works, both in poetry and prose. The Parlour Library copies of the
novel are easily procurable at any bookstall.

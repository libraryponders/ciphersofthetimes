No. 39 King-Street, Cheapside, London, E.C., 15th Sept., 1868.—
The Committee of Sharcholders, appointed at the meeting in March
last, for the purpose of conducting certain proceedings against the
directors, beg to intimate to their subscribers that the proposed actions
are expected to be tried in November next. It was originally intended
that the actions should take place at the last sittings in July, but the
Committee, finding that impossible, had no other alternative but to
submit to the delay referred to.
The Committee are glad to be enabled to state that their application
for subscriptions has been handsomely responded to, as the fund col¬
lected, now in hand, will, in their opinion, be nearly, if not quite,
sufficient to cover the expenses connected with the contemplated pro¬

The Committee intend shortly to close the list of subscribers.

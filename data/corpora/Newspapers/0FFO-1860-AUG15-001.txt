THE Proprietor of the ROYAL ALHAMBRA
PALACE has great plessure in announcing that he has just pur¬
chased, at an outlay of £3,000 one of the greatest living wonders and
curicsities of the age, a PERFORMING HIPPOPOTAMUS. This
amphibious animal was captured in the month of April, 1858, whilst
returning from the equator; several of the native sailors having
espled it ensconced in the reeds, jumped into the water, and disap¬
pearing in the thick herbage soon returned, one of them however
holding it in his arms, its size being that of a spaniel, and
could not not have been, from various circumstances, more than a day
or two old. Its present keeper, Salaama, who has since christened it
"Bucheel," which in Arabie means "the fortunate," reaved it from
its infancy, and tended it with the greatest care, having it likewise
under the most nerfect control, and which its wonderful perform¬
ances fully testify, exhibiting as it does at the word of com¬
mand some of the most astonishing feats. The first public ex¬
hibition will take place on Monday afternoon next, at 2, and in the
evening at 8 o'clock, as also every morning and evening at the same
hours, notwithstanding the low charge (of 6d. and upwards) to see this
extraordinary animal. The usual grand entertainment of nearly three
hours' day and night amusement will be given in addition, consisting
of an exhibition of the following celebrated equestrian artistes, clowns,
vaulters, Arabs from the desert, flying men, and including Herr Chris¬
tophe, and Mr. James Cooke from Astley's Theatre, and the marvellous
feat by the Brothers Berri flying in the air, surpesses, as an exhibition
of daring, anything in the annals of gymuastics. Carriages can be
ordered, for the afternoon performance, at half-past 4, and that of the
evening at haff-past 10 o'clock. Reserved seats, boxes, and places can
be booked during the day. The whole of next week the performances
as usual, and morning performances for children on Wednesday and

R. RAREY, having a few weeks to spare before
returning to America, has made arrangements with Messrs
Howes and Cushing to give his LECTURES and ILLUSTRATIONS
of subdning wild and vicious horses in conjunction with the United
States Circus, the lectures will take place afternoon and evening in
addition to the regular equestrian performances. At Worthing, THIS
DAY, August 15th; Bognor 16th; Chichester, 17th; Gosport, 18th;

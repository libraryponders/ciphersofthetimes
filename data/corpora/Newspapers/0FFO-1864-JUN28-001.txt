THE late £50 BANK-NOTE ROBBERY at
BRENTFORD.—To the Committee, Treasurer, and Subscribers
to the Fund of John William Abraham.—Gentlemen.—The sympathy
and kindly feeling that suggested the benevolent efforts you have so
nobly put forth in my behalf demand from me an acknowledgment of
the deep and lasting obligation under which your disinterested and un¬
expected generosity has laid me.
I assure you the first intimation that reached me of the report that
some of the oldest and most respected inhabitants of Brentford were
organising and subscribing to a fund in my behalf took me quite by
suprise; and I am free to admit the pleasure I derived from the
intelligence, not for the sake of the pecuniary assistance alone, though
for that from my heart I sincerely thank you, but because it testified to
me your opinion upon the merits of the case, and your deliberate
of my conduct in bringing the matter before public notied
for I felt that my private property and apartments had been cruelly
intruded upon, and I considered it but my duty to my fellow-men at
any cost and at all sacrifices to go through with the expense and per¬
plexities of a public trial.
The recollection of your kindness will for ever remain amongst the
most pleasant reflections of my life, and I rejoice the more, because so
many of those who contributed are Brentford people, and are therefore
able to appreclate the case and to exercise an intelligent opinion upon
its merits, which the result of your labours prove they have done in the
most practicable manner possible.
It has come to my knowledge that many more of the Brentford
tradespeople would have been upon the list of subscribers, but for the
fear of thereby jeopardising part of their local interest in business, and
therefore they have tendered to me privately their assistance, though I
have in every such case refused it.
I beg again to thank most sincerely, and shall ever consider myself,
Gentlemen,
teful and obedient servant.

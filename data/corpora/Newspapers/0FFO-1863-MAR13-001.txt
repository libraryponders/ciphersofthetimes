cent-street, Glasgow, 24th January, 1863.—Dear Sirs.—Refering to
your,complaint that the Mauve Paste lately sold by us has been ascer¬
tained by scientific analysis to be an infringement of the patent
granted to you. Mr. William Henry Perkin, on the 26th day of August,
1655, we beg to say, that the paste sold by us has not been of our own
manufacture, or sold by us as such, but has been supplied to us by
Messrs. Petersen and Sichler, of St. Denis, as their agents, who gave
us their written assurance that the paste did not infringe your patent.
Since learning from you, that you were prepared to prove the infringe¬
ment, we have again communicated with Messrs. Petersen and Sichler,
offering them the opportunity of trying the question of infringement at
their own expense. This offer they have not accepted, and we have,
therefore, agreed to pay you the sum of £245 8s. 4d., being the amount
agreed to be accepted by you, as in full of your claims against us in
consequence of our having acted as agents for the said Petersen
and Sichler, in the sale of said paste. We also readily give you our
undertaking not to deal further in the article in question, and wo have
handed over to you all the paste we had on hand.
We remain, gentlemen,
Yours obediently,
JAMES DALE and Co.

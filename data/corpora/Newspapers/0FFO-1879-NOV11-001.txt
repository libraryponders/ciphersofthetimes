LONDON SCHOOL BOARD.—To the ELECTORS of WEST¬
MINSTER.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Have the honour to offer my services as one of your
representatives on the new School Board. If elected, I shall be
able to devote a large portion of my time to the work.
I believe that, as citizens, it is our common duty and interest to
provide that no class of childyen shall grow up among us without
being brought under the civilizing influences of elementary education.
The Education Act of 1870 has already proved of immense practical
bonefit to the country. In London the number of children under in¬
struction has been doubled since it was passed. I desire to sse ite
provimons loyally and energetically acted upon in the spirit shown
by the present Board. In carrying out new work of so large and
varied a nature, mistakes in detail must necessarily have been made,
The new Board will, I hope, benefit by the experience of its prede¬
cossors.
I believe that true economy consists, not in the postponement and
limitation of useful work, which entail heavier expenses in the future,
but in careful management. Ecquomy without efficiency would be
no economy at all. Hat, knowing by experience the heavily increased
charges which have of late years fallen on ratepayers, 1 should direct
my best efforts to the attainment of efficiency without extravagance.
I wish to see the teaching in the Board Schools simple and tho¬
rough, having regard to the requirements of the Government Code.
Where thoroughly efficient Voluntary Schools already exist 1 should
be unwilling to interfere with their activity.
I am in favour of maintaining strictly in its present form the ar¬
rangement now in force in London as to religious instruction.
It has been shown that large funds exist in the metropolis, be¬
queathed ih former generations for charitable purposes now ex¬
hausted. A portion of these funds might, in my opinion, properly be
applied for the benefit of the poor to educational onds, and I should
gladly take a part in urging Parlament to legislate with this obreet.
I am, yours faithfully.

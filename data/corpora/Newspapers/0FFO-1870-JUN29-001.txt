IN the MATTER of NICOLL v. MAURY, heard
May 26, 1870, before his Honour Vice-Chancellor James, a per¬
petual INJUNCTION was granted against the defendapt, restraining
him from making or selling or causing to be made or sold, certain
garments patented by the plaintiff, and commonly known under the
trade mark of RUG PALETOTS, and from making or selling any
colourable imitation thereof, or from using the trade mark so claimed
by the plaintiff.
"London, June 16th, 1870.
"Gentlemen.—I deeply regret having caused you the trouble to de.
fend your patent rights and to institute legal proceedings against me¬
In compliange with the injunction which you have recently obtained.
my solicitors, Messrs. Plews and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed
to pay your cests. I have also directed an account to be prepared of
all consignments I have made to the colonies up te the date of the
injunction. These will, as speedily as possible, be furnished to you, as
well as a statement of all rug paltots that have been made by me in
contrayention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest should be determined by some London or colonial
merchaut to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
"I hope that you will do me the justice to helieve that previous to the
commencement of litigation between us, I sincerely thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact configuration described in your speci¬
fication and drawing attached to the pitent. I, therefore, did not
imagine that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counsel
claimedl it to be) an infringement of the eriginal principle. Such. I
now understand, consists in the formation of material into a garment.
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, se that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the khowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of damages, 1 have no
objection to your publishing this letter.

ELKINGTON and Co., Patentees of the Electro¬
Plate, desire to impress upon public attention the fact that all
articles of their guaranteed manufacture are distinctly stamped with
their trade mark, E. and Co., under a crown, in a shield—the represen¬
tation now so frequently made, that articles, often of the most inferior
description, are plated by Elkington and Co.'s process, is entirely value¬
less as a criterion of quality. In the case of "Elkington v. Johnson,"
recently tried before Vice-Chancellor James, defendant having unlaw¬
fully used their marks, a perpetual injunction was granted restraining
defendant from using or imitating their name or trade marks and
Elkington and Co. give notice that they will take LEGAL PROCEED¬

CAUTION. — Water Filtration.—The LONDON
and GENERAL WATER PURIFYING COMPANY (Limited),
No. 157, Strand (four doors east of Somerset-house), caution the public
that theirs are the only patent cistern filters in which the sole filtering
material is pure animal charcoal, the value of which can be seen by
the following extract from Professor Frankland's report on the quality
of the London water supply, in the month of May, to the Registrar¬
General, vide the Times, June 2d. 1870 :—"Dr. Frankland finds that
by filtering the dymestic supply of his own house (West Middlesex
Company's water) through amal charcoal, the organic matter is
reduced to about one fourth by the process, the water so filtered
scontaining less organic matter than the justly celebrated water
supplied to Manchester from the Derbyshire Hills." The Filters
referred to in the above were supplied by this Company, who caution
the public to be very particular in addressing their letters, or unforg
btunately, if addressed to the Company with no number they may
miscarry. Read "Water and its Impurities," by post 2d. Note the
address, 157, Strand.

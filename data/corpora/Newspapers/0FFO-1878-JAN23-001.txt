which narrowed the market for it."—John Stuart Mill's "Principles
of Political Economy." Buyers of silver plats need be under no ap¬
prehension that the abolition of the duty will in the stightest degree
affect Hall marking, beyond the withdrawal of the Queen's head or
uy mark. An effort will be made to obtain the REPEAL of the
DUTIES upon GOLD nd SILVER PLATE in the present Sestion of
Parliament. For all statistical information application should be

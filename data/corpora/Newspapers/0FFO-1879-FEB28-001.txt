FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Nonce.—An
effort will be made in the present Sesion of Parliament to ob¬
perfect FREEDOM of TRADI: for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excize
varying from 12g to 20 per cent. upon articies of pally ose, and by the
stid more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is il: un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, an
proved by the annual dimmution of the trade; (3 subversive of the
recognized principles of modern nscal legisiation; (4 contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical enucation in its appli¬
cation to simversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inne¬
fensible by statesmen, political econemists, poitticians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the Untted Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the under-igned,

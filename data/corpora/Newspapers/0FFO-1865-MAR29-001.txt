—The FIRST LETTER of a NEW NAME.
MYDROPULT.—Caution. —Devices in imitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are caiculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. The
proprietor therefore issues this caution, and respectfully intimates that
parties gishing to purchase the hydropult should examine the machine
offered for sale, and see if it has attached thereto a label, with the fol¬
lowing words:—"The Hydropult, Vose's Patent, manufactured only
by Griffiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles Pomeroy Button,
proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London." Unless this label is
attached the machine is not the hydropult. Hydropults weigh but 81b.,
and will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. Hydropults will draw
water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. Hydro¬
pults can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or forcepump is
applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances are useless.
Hydropuits have been recommended as an efficient and useful fire¬
engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of Great
Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department as
fire-engines. Robert Hogg, LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibberd, Esq.,
F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other well¬
known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable garden
implement. Hydropults have been recommended by the Gardeners'

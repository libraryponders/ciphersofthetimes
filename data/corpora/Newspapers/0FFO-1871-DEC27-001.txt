REPRINTS.—The Hon. Mrs. NORTON notifies to
all who may have been misled into supposing her a contributor
to a current journal of female fashions and light literature, by vague ad¬

knows nothing whatever of the paper or its publisher; that she has
examined the portion of one of her novels issued by the advertisers
and finds it to be an imperfect reprint (wanting the dedication) from
the 90th volume of the well-known Parlour Library, published 20 years
ago, in that form, with her sanction, by Sims and McIntyre, of
Belfast, and afterwards by Thomas Hodgson, of Paternoster-row, at the

inferior re-issue; on the contrary, a superior one-volumed edition is in

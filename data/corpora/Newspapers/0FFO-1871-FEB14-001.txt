CAUTION.—LLOYD'S EUXESIS. — Chymists,
perfumers, and the public are hereby informed that the Chancery
suit "Hovenden v. Lloyd" was heard on the 20th July last, when,
without calling on defendant's counsel, the Court dismissed Mr. Hoven¬
den's bill, and ordered him to pay all the costs of the suit; thereby
establishing the indubitable and incontestable right ofthe widow of the
late A. S. Lloyd to the manufacture of this much-esteemed article, the
secret for the preparation of which is in her sole possession. A. Lloyd,
defehdant in the above action, therefore cautions purchasers to ob¬
serve the following distinctive marks on her genuine Euxesis:—1stly.
The words "Prepared by his Widow", in raised letters on top of tube
2dly. The address No. 3, Spur-street, Leicester-square, on both Eng¬

CAUTION.—PANCREATIC EMULSION and
PANCREATINE. The efficacy of these remedies in the treatment
of consumption, indigestion, and wasting diseases depending entirely
upon their purity and strength, Messrs. SAVORY and MOORE caution
the public against inferior preparations, which are calculated to cause
disappointment, and to injure the reputation these medicines have ac¬
quired. Purchasers should see that each bottle has the names of Savory
and Moore, and their trade mark.—143, New Bond-street, London.
CAUTION.—The Registrar-General's Returns show
an alarmingly increased mortality from scarlet and other forms
of fever. The highest medical authorities consider impure water a
most fruitful source of such diseases, and as no water stored in a sis¬
tern is ever pure, it should never be drunk unless properly filtered,
and the latest and best system of so doing is that—requiring no atten¬
tion on the part of servants and others—introduced by the LONDON
and GENRRAL WATER PURIFYING COMPANY (Limited)
No. 157, Strand (four doors from Somerset-house), where the process
can be vicwed and full particulars obtained. Read "Water, its Im¬
purities and Purification," per post, 3d.

which instantly adapt themsolves to any jewels without fear of the
slightest injury, or the necessity of ever being fitted. 2d. The appli¬
cation of patent fire resisting iron safes, which without interfering
with the portability of the case, prove a great security for valuable con¬
tents. As imitations of this invention are being made, it is important

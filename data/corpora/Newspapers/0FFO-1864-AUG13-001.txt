THE late CENTRAL SOCIETY Of VINEYARD
PROPRIETORS of SAINTES BRANDY TRADE MARK.—
"Niox and others v. Leveaux."—No. 3, Barge-yard, Bucklersbury,
August 10, 1864.—In addition to my other letter, inserted on the 5th
and 8th inst., it is true the Master of the Rolis did say that defendant
was in the wrong, because—Firstly, he sold the bottles of brandy im¬
ported to him with the imitative label in question (though inad¬
vertently and in ignorance of such imitation); and, secondly,
because (as plaintiffs persisted in the suit and increasing costs,
notwithstanding defendant's fair and candid conduct and offers
from the moment plaintiffs' objection was made) defendant did by
his answer question plaintiffs' right to use as exclusive the label of the
former Society, which had failed and broken up; and also plaintiffs'
right to designate as "Cognac" the cheap kind of brandy plaintiffs
sell. His Honour thought the balance of evidence against us. But that
defendant had good reason to think otherwise was proved by the evi¬
dence of many competent persons, and among others by that of
Mousicur Emile Albert, Counsel, Chairman of the Order of
Advocates of the Civil Tribunal of First Instance of Cognac, of which
extracts are subjoined. The Master of the Rolls said "I think it ex¬
tremely probable that when defendant received this bottle he laid it
aside, and never noticed the label on it, and did not notice that the
label on the other brandies was, in point of fact, a colourable imita¬
tion; yet, when he sells other brandies with that colourable imitation,
he is liable in respect of it. I think the defendant was remarkably
well advised when he wrote that letter and made the offer he did,
and which, in my opinion, was the full amount he was bound to
make, short of this, that he might have been required to show the
plaintiffs he made no profits, or to account for any profits he may
have made." Defendant proved that he had not made a profit, but a
loss. Plaintiffs made no complaint before filing their bill,
I am, &c.

Defendants' Solicitor.
Extracts from opinion of Mons. Emile Albert, Counsel, Chairman of
the Order of Advocates of the Civil Tribunal of First Instance of
Cognae, Cognac, Department of Charente, 15th December, 1863:—
"The Society of Saintes, which marks its casks and bottles Central
Society of Vineyard Proprietors Cognac, does not state the truth. It is
not a Society at Cognac, but at Saintes, which has never formed a por¬
tion of the district of Cognac. If they sell Saintes brandy they should
put Saintes on the casks and bottles, but if they mark the produce of
Saintes  Cognac," they deceive the purchaser. In the dictionary of
Mr. Louis Barre, 1854, we find Cognac, S.M. (common noun), brands
distilled at Cognac, thus the word Cognac always indicates Cognac
brandy, and by no means brandy of Saintes, La Rochelle, &c., unless
improperly employed. The manufacturers of brandy, at Saintes, have
no right to call the brandy there produced Cognac Brandy.

SPECIAL NOTICE.—Messrs. SUTTON and Co.,
general shipping agents, of 101, Leadenhall-Street, beg to give
notice, that the letter signed on the 29th July, 1863, by W. R. Sutton,

The Times by another shipping firm, has nothing whatever to de with
them: and the latter being inserted in the same publication, with a
shipping advertisement from the same firm, tends to mislead the public

Office, 46A, Pall-mall, S.W.
THE ANONYMOUS DONOR of £4,000, for the
BUILDING or COMPLETION of a CHURCH, is earnestly
solicited to give his benevolent attention to one the poorest, most
distressed and struggling districts in the suburbs of London, viz, St.
Andrew, Haverstock-hill. This is most probably one of the districts
to which his attention has already been directed, and its destitute con¬
dition is no doubt well known to him; and should he be induced to
give his munificient donation this direction he will be securing a great
spiritual benefit to upwards of 8,000 souls; will cheer the heart and
obtain the prayers of the clergyman, who has laboured more than eight
years in this district, without stipend; and of many who have been
long and still are labouring earnestly, but now almost despondingly,
with him.
CHARING-CROSS HOSPITAL, West Strand.
London, W.C.—The Committee thankfully ACKNOWLEDGE
the RECEIPT, through the donation-boxes at the Hospital, during the

DYSTERS.—The public are cautioned against
purchasing oysters represented to be WHITSTABLE NATIVES,
large quantities being sold by private dealers as natives which are
not only inferior in quality and flavour, but intrinsically are not so
valuable by one fourth as the real native oysters. The Whitstable
Natives may be purchased in large or small quantities by application to
Mr. GEORGE BAKER, 30, Fish-Street-hill, London; or to the Whit¬
stable Oyster Company, at Whitstable. This is the only certain way
of obtaining a supply of the genuine native oyster.

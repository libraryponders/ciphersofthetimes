ENGLISH CHAPEL, Boujah.—The English con¬
gregation in the village of Boujah, near Smyrna, has, for the
last 25 years, met for Divine worship in a building which (originally a
dwelling-house), was, in 1853, fitted up as a temporary chapel, and con¬
secrated in 1843 by the late Bishop of Gibraltar. Attached to this is a
burial ground, which has been and still is used as a cemetery by the
whole British community of Smyrna. The building itself is now in a
sad state of dilapidation, being scarcely fit for use. It is proposed to
erect a new but plain chapel upon the site of the old one. To this end
benevolent DONATIONS are earnestly and respectfully solicited.
About £1,000 will be required. Of this sum nearly £300 have been
raised by the congregation of Boujah. Contributions will be received
in London by Messrs. Hanson, Brothers; and Messrs. Masterman

ON CHLORATE of POTASSA, and its USE
in OXYDIZING the BLOOD.—Mr. J. P. SARGEANT,
M.R.C.S. and L.S.A. (1836), will LECTURE on this subject at
St. James's-hall, Piccadilly, September, 16th, and will satisfactorily
prove that chlorate of potassa (as prepared by passing chlorine
through a mixture of quicklime and water, and subsequently boiling
a long time with chloride of potassium) is a most active remedy for
oxydizing the blood, and restoring vitality to the low, vitiated state of
the nervous system, and is therefore calculated to supersede the use of
iron, mercury, quinine, and sarsaparilla.—56, Gower-street, Bedford-sq.in

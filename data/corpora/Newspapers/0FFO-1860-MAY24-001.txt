and E.—You do me an injustice to say that I am
tampering with you. Your kind notes were duly acknowledged.
The first was destroyed "unopened "(? The second was returned.
Though I may never have the happiness of seeing you again the
memory of the past will supply the tide-flow of joy. Farewell.
—I RECEIVED your NOTE on the 11th inst.,
and request that you will inform me how I can send a letter to you,
having an important matter to communicate which I do not wish to
put in an advertisement. A letter of considerable moment to you was
sent in the same way as the one you acknowledged in September, and
almost directly after that one, but it was returned unclaimed. If you
will enable me to do this, I will communicate with you upon the sub¬
ject of your last at the same time. It is so important the matter
should come under your notice that, unless I hear from you, I shall
repeat this advertissement—W. H. I.

RELOVED SON.—Your seeret departure from home
has caused us more anguish and suffering than I can express.
In reply to this appeal I beseech you to come home, or write and tell me
where I can meet you. I now know all the causes of your depression,
besides the debts you acknowledge. Most truly de I grieve for and
with you, and my heart yearns to tell you that I forgive you. Do not
spurn a mother's love, but believe that she feels for you and that her
one desire is to see you and forward your wishes as to your future
prospects. We are striving to keep all quict in the hope you will at
once let us hear from you for you cannot but feel that the step you haye
taken in leaving home clandestinely must bring disgrace upon us as well

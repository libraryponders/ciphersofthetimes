NOTICE.—BROKERS.—City of London.—
Whereas, by an Act of Parliament passed in the 6th year of the
reign of her late Majesty, Queen Anne, it is enacted "That all per¬
sons that shall act as Brokers within the city of London and Liberties
thereof shall from time to time be admitted by the Court of Mayor
and Aldermen of the said city for the time being, under such restric¬
tions and limitations for their honest and good behaviour as
that Court shall think fit and reasonable"; and by an Act of Parlia¬
ment passed in the 57th year of the reign of his late Majesty, King
George III., after reciting the said first-mentioned Act, it is enacted
"That if any person shall take upon him to act as a Broker, or employ,
or cause, permit, or suffer any person or persons to be employed with,
under, or for him, to act as such within the said city and liberties,
not being admitted in pursuance of the said recited Act, every such per¬
son so offending shall forfeit and pay to the use of the Mayor and
Commonalty and citizens of the said city, for every such offence, the
sum of £100, to be recovered by action of debt, in the name of the
Chamberlain of the said city, in any of his Majesty's Courts of Re¬
cord"; and whereas, there is great reason to believe that many persons
who are not admitted by the Court of Mayor and Aldermen do exercise
the office of a Broker, and employ others under them to act as such,
within the said city and liberties, in contempt and violation of the law,
to the great injury and prejudice of those who are duly admitted to be
brokers of this city, and to the manifest hazard of merchants and
others employing persons who are under no restrictions or limitations,
nor have given bond with sureties for their honest and good behaviour,
as brokers regularly admitted by the Court of Aldermen are subjected
to: Notice is therefore hereby given, that whoever will give IN¬
FORMATION, either to the Comptroller, at his office in Guildhall, or
to Mr. John Thornton, 2, Guildhall-chambers, Basinghall-Street,
receiver of brokers' rents, of any offence committed contrary to the
said Act, shall receive a REWARD of FIFTY POUNDS on convic¬
tion of the offender, who will be prosecuted on such information at
the expense of the city.

AMORRIS JOSEPH, of Hatchett's Hotel, Picca¬
dilly, in the county of Middlesex, gentleman, hereby give notice,
that from and after this 23d day of December, 1864, I shall dis¬
continue and abandon the use of my present surname, and, in lieu
thereof, ASSUME and USE the SURNAME of MORICE and the first
names of HUBERT JAY, in addition to my present first name Morris,
and that from henceforth I shall describe myself as, and be known by,
the name of Morris Hubert Jay Morice. In witness whereof I, the
said Morris Joseph, have set my hand and seal to a certain deed poll
to the same tenour and effect as this notice, and shall forthwith cause
the said deed to be enrolied in Her Majesty's High Court of Chancery
in England.—As witness my hand this 23d day of December, 1864.

THE OCTACON SCARF,
patented Nov. 15th,
1864. No. 2.847. — Whereas it has been suggested by advertise¬
ment, and otherwise, that our Octagon Scarf is an infringement of
an alleged patent, we annex opinion of Mr. Theodore Aston, of the
Northern Circuit, touching the matter, and hereby give notice that
we are ready to guarantee all persons selling or dealing in our said
scarf. Proceedings will be taken against all persons infringing our
patent rights. LLOYD and ATTREE, 32, Wood-street, London.

I have read the specification of letters patent granted to Mr. Alfred
Swonnell, bearing date May 6th, 1864, for "Improvements in the con¬
struction of Scarfs.
Assuming the alleged invention to be the subject-matter of letters
patent, it relates to a particular mode of constrt.
ing reversible scarfs.
I have examined the scarf made by Messrs. Lloyd and Attree called
the Octagon Scarf, patented Nov. 15th, 1864, and I am of opinion that
the manufacture or sale of the Octagon Searf would not be any in¬
fringement of Mr. Swonnell's patent.

tations. It shows the satellites of the planets Jupiter and Saturn with
the rings of the latter all clearly defined with a sharpness of outline

Mizar it clearly and beautifully resolved that interesting object. It is
an admirable instrument."—39, Albensarle-street, Piccadilly.

DEFECTIVE SIGHT.—"Upwards of eight years
ago I applied to Mr. Salom for lenses to suit a pecullar defect of
vision, which I found constantly increasing, and for which I had tried
glasses recommended by other opticians, that had the effect of render¬
ing vision more distinct for a time, but which invariably tended ulti¬
mately to increase the evils, while, on the contrary, notwithstanding
my being constantly engaged in laborious professional studies, my sight
has, under the use of the lenses obtained from Mr. Salom, greatly im¬
proved. I attribute much of his success to the admirable manner in
which he suits his lenses to the focus of each eye.—George Mackay,
M.D., F.R.C.S.E., Annual President of the Hunterian Medical Society
of Edinburgh, &c. Prices most moderate.—SALOM and Co., 187, Re¬

CAUTION.—Water Filteys.—The LONDON and
GENERAL WATER PURIFYING COMPANY caution the
public that all its FILTERS have the Company's name on them, and
no others are genuine. It is also very essential that all letters should

to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
Wotherspoon v. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in sonnexion with Starch is indigputably esta¬
blished, would also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendent illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penaity of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
been induced to buy it, that to save them from total loes we will
allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisloy, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entall a loss upon oufselves, as the packets will be braken no and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
t in perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by meaps of an excise
varying from 12½, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (l) un¬
just, seeing that no other sunilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual dimmution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recoguized principles of modern hscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical education in its applj¬
cation to silversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political cconomists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to Edward J.

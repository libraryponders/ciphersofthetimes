Letters being frequently misdirected, notice is given that the only ad¬
dress is 200, Regent-st., W
ahen sole Manager W. H. PALMER, Esq.
CAUTION.-HARRIS'S SPECTACLES.—THOMAS
HARRIS and SON CAUTION the public against persons using
their name. Their business, established 1780, is solely conducted at 52
Great Russell-Street, opposite the British Museum-gate, where only can
be had their celebrated spectacles, opera and field glasses. No travellers.
CAUTION.—PILLISCHERS QUEEN'S READ¬
ING and MICROSCOPE LAMPS, as supplied by him to Her
Majesty and the Royal Family.—The public are CAUTIONED against
inferior imitations. M. Pillischer, optician, 88, New Bond-street, being
the sole inventor and manufacturer of these celebrated lamps. Draw¬
ings and prices post frec. No agents.
CAUTION.—JENNER and KNEWSTUB,
patentees of the A BC Despatch Box, beg respectfully to caution
the public against the deceptive and useless imitations of their ELGIN
WRITING-CASE, which is to be had only of the inventors and manu¬
facturers, Jenner and Knewstub, to the Queen, 33, St. James's-street,
and 66. Jermyn-street.
CAUTION.—The real genuine MACASSARINE
OIL is reduced to 1s., and H. BREIDENBACH informs the

sale houses, or from his manufactory, provided the signature be H.
Breidenbach, 157B, New Bond-street. London, perfumer to the Queen.
CAUTION.—The Public are warned against the
attempts of those who seek as near as they dare to copy
the design of Messrs. D. NICOLL and Co.'s PATENTED GAR¬
MENTS, and particularly with regard to the dual garment called
the Rug Paletot. Unprincipled persons, who have only suddenly
awakened to the advantage of this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to pass off clumsy
imitations for that which D. Nicoll and Co. have already proved
to be the cheapest articte ever offered to the public. The safeguard
will be the right to demand to see the trade mark, which may be thus
described: the Coats of Arms of London and Paris are printed or
wovon on to a loop used for hanging up the garment, and between
these emblems of the two cities the words "Nicoll's Patent" appear.
INFORMATION as to INFRINGEMENT should be sent to 6, Fell¬
street, Wood-street, E.C.
IMPORTANT CAUTION.—The unprecedented suc¬
cess of ROWLAND'S MACASSAR OIL for the hair has caused
counterfeiters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy
the labels as frequently to deceive the unwary; some offer to dispose
of the recipe of a Macassar oil, with other recipes of a similar cha¬
racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real ( article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
only purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfelters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the toilet."

Q.—Received. All well. Quite happy now.
W.
Before another year is over.—LOYAL.
INO—GEORGIE.—You, and you only, can save me.
Turn not a deaf ear, or, when it is too late and I am beyond your
reach and loving voice you will regret having forced yourself to be
thus cruel and hard. How can you so easily forget all? You grossly
misunderstand me. Am I to advertise in vain? Are you ill, or why
this silence? Relieve my anxiety, or I cannot bear it any longer.
How you can is inexplicable to me. Write. I beseech you. One
meeting would settle all finally and satisfactorily.

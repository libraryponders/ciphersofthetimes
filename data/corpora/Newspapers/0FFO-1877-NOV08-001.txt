FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS for IMPROVED

CATTLE TRUCK; also a Premium of £100 for Alterations of or
Additions to Cattle Trucks at present in use ; also an additional
Premium of £100 to each successful competitor so soon as he shall
have induced a railway company to buaid 50 of his improved trucks,
and to bring the same into actual use on their line for the transport of
cattle.

sions, construction, material, &c., for the same purposes for which
cattie trucks are now used; the truck shall be roofed and provided
with spring buffers and axle springs, or other appliances to prevent
injuries to ammals during shuntings and sudden startings and stop¬
pages; the track shall be provided with appointments in the carriages

NOTICE.—TINSLEYS PATENT BEDSTEAD is
now in stock, ready for immediate delivery. From the Lancet:—
"We have seen at Messrs. Maple and Co.'s rooms an excellent inven¬
tion, which will prove especially serviceable to invalids. The patent
hedstead enables the occupant to be raised to any position without
the least exertion or disturbance, all being effected by the turning of a
winch-handle. Whether in slight cases of indisposition, which necessi¬
tates taking breakfast in bed, or in severe or chronic maladies it will
be found equally useful. The contrivance is at once ingenious and
simple, and what is of no small consequence, the bedstead is cheap.

THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY
EXHIBITION of 1862.—Although the Great Exhibition Build¬
ing, now in course of erection, covers nearly 25 acres of ground
yet there remains a very large number of intending exhibitors who
have been necessarily excluded by the want of space. This has caused
great disappointment, both at home and abroad, to many who had
made preparations for the exposition of their productions.
To meet this want, and at the same time to give facilities for the sale
of the goods which will be collected from all parts of the world, a
Company has been formed, the capital of which is subscribed, for the
purpose of erecting on a spot closely contiguous to the Great Exhibi¬
tion Building an ornamental structure, designed by Sir Joseph Paxton,
where the exhibitors will have the advantage of a building in every
respect applicable for a favourable display of their goods, and with the
privilege of selling the saine to the vast concourse of visitors who will
inevitably be attracted to London during the present year¬
The building will be called THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPLE¬
MENTARY EXHIBITION, and will cover about three acres of
ground. The whole of the space for exhibition will be upon the ground
ficor, and upon the walls, there being no galleries, and such is the per¬
fection of the design, that all parts will be equally well lighted.
A provisional contract has been entered into with an eminent con¬
tractor for the erection of the building, which is to be completed, un¬
der a heavy penalty, on or before the 15th day of May next. The
charges will be—
For floor space..		12s. per square foot.
For wall space
Persons desirous of obtaining space must apply to the offices of the
Company, having previously paid to the credit of the trustees at the
City Bank, Threadneedie-street, or at the Agra Bank, 27, Cannon¬
street, the amount payable upon the space applied for, which will be
allotted according to the priority of application.

Sir Robert Walter Carden, Alderman, Chairman of the City Bank.
Mr. Alderman Finnis, Director of the Agra Bank.

If from any cause the building should not be completed, or if the
space applied for should not be allotted, the amount of the deposit¬

Further particulars may be obtained at the temporary offices of the

having called to our attention that certain beer has been bottled by
us, and supplied under your label and trade mark to a customer at
Forest-hill, who roturned the same to us, and that, upon complaint,
you found the same very inferior to your beer, we desire to express
our regret that (owing to our bottler having inadvertently put your
labels on the wrong bottles, he being at the time engaged in bottling
your and another brewer's beer) such beer should have been sent out
by us, purporting to hve been brewed and supplied by you, and we
now offer you a full and complete APOLOGY for the same, and we
hereby authorize you to make such use, by publication or otherwise,
of this apology as you may think fit. —Dated 23d day of December.

FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 12½, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that ne other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual dimmution of the trade; (3 subversive of the
recognized principles of modern nscal legisiation; (9) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the preas of the Unsted Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the under-igned.

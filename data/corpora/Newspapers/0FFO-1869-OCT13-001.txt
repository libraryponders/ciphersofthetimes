DEAR NELL.—Do WRITE. I cannot believe you
are gone without a goodbye to me; and your last word, "To¬
row,"is always in my ears.—J"M.
You should regard every matter as an in¬
trusted secret, which you believe the person concerned would
wish to be considered as such. Morcover, you ought to consider as
secrets intrusted, all circumstances which would bring scandal upon
another if told, and which are not your certain duty to discuss in your
own person, and to his face. I cannot, therefore, assist vou under the
circumstances related in your letter.—Pollaky, Private Inquiry-office,

October 4, 1869.—In a report of some remarks made by me, at
the last meeting of the Metropolitan Board of Works upon the subject
of a committee to control the action of the gas, water, and petroleum
Acts, mention is made of ROWATTS WHARF, Bow, as being a case

counterfeiters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy
the labels as frequently to deceive the unwary; some offer to dispose

racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real 40) article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
l purchase it. The name of these wretclfed counterfeiters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the tollet."

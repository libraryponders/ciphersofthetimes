PRIZE ESSAYS on the MODEL PARISH.
Prizes of 100 guineas and 50 guineas respectively, were offered by a
Christian gentleman nearly two years ago, by public advertisement, for
the best and second best essays on this important subject. The com¬
petition was open. The adjudicators were the Rev. Dr. Sidney Smith,
D.D., ex F.T.C.D., and Professor of Biblical Greek in the University
of Dublin; the Rev. Canon Miller, D.D., Rector of St. Martin's, Bir¬
mingham; and the Rev. William Pennefather, A.B., Incumbent of
Christ Church, Barnet. Forty-three essays were sent in, and the ad¬
judicators, after a most patient and careful scrutiny, have at length
terminated their labours, and are unanimous in awarding the first
prize to an Essay by the Rev. J. B. Heard, lately Minister of Percy
Chapel, London: and the second to an Essay by the Rev. F. R. Wynne,
St. Mary's, Kilkenny. These essays will be published immediately,
and, it is hoped, will prove a seasonable help at this time, when atten¬
tion is specially directed towards promoting the greater efficiency of the
parochial system and its aduptation to the wants of the community at
large. The Essays signed "W.M.R.W." and S.W." are commended as
possessing a high degree of merit, and the authors are requested to
communicate with the adjudicators, who will consider their communi¬

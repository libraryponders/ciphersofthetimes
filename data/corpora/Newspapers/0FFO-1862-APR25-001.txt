you during the voyage. But, whilst following a custom generally
adopted by passengers on similar occasions, we would wish to convey
somewhat more than a formal note of thanks. Independently of the
kindness we have received from you personally, we wish to bear testi¬
mony likewise to the very liberal treatment and superior accommoda¬
tion afforded us; and which (speaking as we do with some experience
in these matters) we contidently assert to be superior to what is usually
to be met with, and we think it only right and proper to say so.
We remain, dear Sir, yours very truly,
LESTHER AHIER.

By order of the Committee, HENRY ROBINS, Secretary.
Corn Exchange, London, 9th May, 1871.
THE undersigned would be happy to receive COM¬
MUNICATIONS from truly patriotic citizens of every class,
with the view of suggesting the early FORMATION of an ASSOCI¬
ATION, whose sole aim should be to ventilate thoroughly and collect
the real opinions of the mass of the British people on the two following
questions, so vitally important to the future of our existence as a great
and powerful commercial nation:—
1. Is there any foundation in reality for the persistent statements of
a certain class of politicians, that the idea of establishing an Army of
Reserve on a grand scale, by means of a short compulsory service of a
year or 15 months, followed by nine years of liability to serve during
time of war; 100,000 men, without distinction of class, between the
ages of 21 and 35, being annually drawn by ballot for one year's or 15
months' continuous training within their own countes, on an average
pay of 3s, a day while so embodied, is an idea unchangeably repugnant
to the feelings of our countrymen, and would not be tolerated?
3. Is it impossible, imstead of disintegrating by a policy of lukewarm¬
ness and neglect our widespread ompire, to weld Great Britain and all
her Colonial children into one great Anglo-Saxon Confederation of
internally self-governed States, with a truly Imperial Parliament, com¬
posed of members elected by the several Confederated States Legisla¬
tures, to meet in London, as the capital of the whole Empire, to delibe¬
rate on all questions of peace, war, and foreign policy?
All who would be willing to join and aid in the formation of an
Assoclation such as suggested are earnestly invited to addrees (in strict
confidence) their letters and suggestions, post.
to the undersigned,
care of the postmaster, Norbiton, Surrey.—JUNIUS INDICUS.

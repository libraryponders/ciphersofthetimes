varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more obyectionable systom of compulsory hall-marking, is (l) un¬
just, seeig that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual duminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern hscal legislation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacte to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensinle by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of cpinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application shouid be made to the undersigned,
EDWARD J. WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

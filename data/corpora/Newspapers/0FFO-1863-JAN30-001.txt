succeeded in many instances by these false representations in inveigling
honest, industrious, young persons to quit their home and proceed
abroad, where they invariably find themselves entrapped into houses
of ill-fame without the means of escape. This infamous traffic has of
late so alarmingly increased and baffied all endeavours to check it,
that recourse is had to this public notice, in the hope that it will pre¬
vent English girls from too readily listening to any such proposals
proceeding from questionable parties, and in all such cases they are
requested to notify the same without delay to Mr. Pollaky, who is

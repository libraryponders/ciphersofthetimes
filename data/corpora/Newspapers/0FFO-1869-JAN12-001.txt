in his remarkable library, Many bookcollactors, ospecially those resident
in the country, would often gladly patch the leathern coats of their
favourites had they but the means of doing so. A hint on the want of
such means put Messrs. Partridge and Cooper, stationers, Fleet-street.
on their mettle, and the result is a new mat rial for the purpose, which
they invented, and sell under the name of Chartapellicia. As the
price of this new material is very moderate, and it is easily applied by
means of strong paste or glue, and is morcover made in some 20
different co ours to represent the various leathers used in bookbinding,
there can be littie doubt of thie ingenious invention meeting with the
general patronage which it so well deserves."—Notes and Queries, Dec.

but which, in fact, was not their genuine whisky, have been forwarded
from my Stores at Chester, and on my account, in execution of an
order for three hogsheads of their whisky. I had no personal know¬
ledge of the transaction, exceedingly regret it, and am much indebted
to John Jameson and Son for having, after investigating the circum¬

caused to be instituted against me. I paying all costs of, and incidental
to, such proceeding. — Dated this 6th day of October 1877.

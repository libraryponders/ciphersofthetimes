Engraved in line by J. H. Watt. After the picture by Sir Charles
Eastlake, P.R.A. As a work of high art, in point of subject and
in style of execution, this is one of the noblest pictures ever
painted; while from the power as well as refinement thrown
into the engraving, it forms an unparalleled object of decoration,
alike from its effective yet harmonious appearance and the sublimity
of the undying lessons it is ever present to instil. Although the en¬
graved plate cost the publishers £5,000, it was destroyed before a single
imperfect impression was printed, in order to exsure an unique work
of art, of a constantly increasing value, to ever) possessor of any state
of proof or print. The engraving is in pure line, of a commanding
size, 22½ by 20; on paper 44 by 33.

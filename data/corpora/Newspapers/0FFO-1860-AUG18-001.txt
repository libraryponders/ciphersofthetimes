BAREY.—Mr. J. S. RAREY, the celebrated horse
tamer, has made an arrangement for a few weeks (previous to
his returning to America) with Messrs. Howes and Cushing to give a
SERIES of LRCTURES and PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATIONS
upon his SYSTEM of SUBDUING WILDand VICIOUS HORSES.
The proprietors of the United States Circus, ever anxious to procure
the first and best talent that can be obtained, have secured, as above,
the services of Mr. Rarey, at an enormous expense, and his lectures will
be given afternoon and evening, in addition to the regular equestrian
performances. It would seem almost annecessary at this time to expa¬
tiate upon the extraordinary and wonderful success Mr. Rarey has met
with, not only in Great Britain, but throughout all Europe. He has
had the honour of appearing before nearly all the Crowned heads and
Courts of Europe, and his system of horse taming has met the unquall¬
fied approval of the nobility, clergy, gentry, the newspaper press, and
general public. For weeks together the Royal Alhambra Palace, Lon¬
don, was crowded daily to witness his successful efforts in subduing
some of the most dangerous and vicious horses that could be procured,
among which the notorious entire horse Idle Boy, from the Rawclife
Paddocks, York, who was so savage in his nature that no one dared to
approach him, and he was kept in a box lined with iron, as wood alone
would not withstand his kicks. This horse was led into the cireus
muzzled, kicking and biting furiously: in less than half an hour Mr.

straw. He will exhibit at Ryde. Isle of Wight, August 20th: Ventnor,

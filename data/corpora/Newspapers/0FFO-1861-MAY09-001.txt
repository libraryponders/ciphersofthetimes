Rugby, April 19, 1861.
PUBLICATION.—In an almost impenetrable ravine
in the declivity of Mount Rheineck, which is situate immediately
on the banks of the Rhine, between Brohl and Niederbreisig (a district
of the Tribunal of First Insta ne.
of Coblence, Rhenish-Prussia), on
22d of last March, was FOUND the BODY of some person, a
FEMALE, from 20 to 30 years of age or thereabouts, concealed in a
recess, covered with large stones. The period of decease cannot be
precisely determined. Death was caused by a ball shot from a gun.
which traversed the breast and back. Description—height 5ft. 2 or 3
inches; hair, fair; teeth, sound, small, and somewhat irregularly set
in the lower jaw. Dress.—1. Chemise, cambric, 3 ft. 6 inches long, the
upper hem forming a running string, with two eyelet-holes, two fine
and even cords passing through; in the centre of the round breast of
the chemise, and below the eyelet-holes, the initials "A. H. 36" are
embroidered in Gothic characters in relief, half an inch long. 2. A
night gown of fine white dimity, collar turned down, 2 ft. 3 inches, with
white mother of-pearl buttons; some remains of a fine material, with
brown and white stripes (jaconet muslin), in the white stripe is a small
winding white line, with red spots. In the vicinity of the body have
been found the remnants of a petticoat, 3 ft. 2 inches long, it is com¬
posed of fine white dimity, striped, the same material as the night gown
on the upper edge, which is an inch and a half broad, with white
riband strings, are embroidered in white letters, 21 lines, in relief, and
in large characters of the German printed alphabet, the initials "M. R.
6." The bottom hem is finished with a cord in linen thread. The fine
quality of the materials and the elegant make of all those articles indi¬
eate that the victim belonged to a rich class. In consequence of the
state of putrefaction and external destruction, it is impossible to notice
other marks of recognition. I request of any person who can give
information concerning this unknown individual, and the circum¬
stances of her death, to be so good as to furnish me with the particu¬
lars, else to communicate them to the nearest magistrates. The arti¬
cles of dress above mentioned, together with the lower jaw, are depo¬
sited for inspection at my office.

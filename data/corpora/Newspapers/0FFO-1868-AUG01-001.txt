POLOGY.—Our attention having been called by
Mr. WILLIAM PRICE, of Southampton-buildings, Chancery-¬
lane, London, and also of Chancery-lane taforesaid, robemaker, to
certain statements which he considers affect his character, con¬
tained in a pamphlet printed by us, entitled "The Persecutions of a
Solicitor," we beg to say that the work was handed to our foreman to
be printed in the ordinary course of business by Mr. Elworthy, a soli¬
citor, for whom we had previously done law printing, and that it was
set up in great haste, and delivered without either ourselves or our
foreman being aware of the contents, and that any statements therein
contained are wholly without our knowledge:  We therefore APOLO¬
GISE to Mr. Price for having printed the said pamphiet, and desire it
to be understood that none of the statements therein contained are
made with our knowledge or authority. —Dated this 31st day of July,

LAND REGISTRY.—No. 521.—No. 88, Farringdon¬
street, London.—In the Matter of the Act of 25th and 26th
Victoria, chap. 53, notice is hereby given, that on the application of
MARY HOOLE, of No. 6, Taviton-street, Gordon-square, in the
county of Middlesex, spinster, the Registrar intends, at the expira¬
tion of three calendar months from the date hereof, to REGISTER
with an indefeasible TITLE, the HEREDITAMENTS called or known
as No. 88, Farringdon-street, in the parish of St. Bride, in the city of
London, in the tenure or occupation of Edmund Appleyard, and de¬
lineated on the map No. 521, deposited in the Office of Land Registry as
part of the description of the same hereditaments, and thereon edged
with red, together with the mines and minerals under the same.
If any person objects to, or desire to show cause against, such registra¬
tion, or claims that the same should be subject to any conditions or
reservations, or that any particular estate or incumbrance, charge or
liability, not already proved or admitted before the Registrar, should be
entered on the register, such person may be heard at the Office of Land
Registry, No. 34, Lincoln's-inn-fields, at any time before the expiration
of the said three months, personally or by his solicitor or counsel, or by
affidavit or otherwise, to make such objection to, or to show cause
against, or to make such claim in respect of such registration. But
any person desiring to make such objection or claim must lodge
the same in writing, stating the particulars thereof, and with his
name and address thereto, in the said office before the expiration
of the said three months, otherwise he will be excluded from making
the same. The aforesaid map may be inspected at the said office at any
time before the expiration of the said three months. —Dated this

THE NORWEGIAN SELF-ACTING COOKING
APPARATUS (SORENSEN's PATENT).—The present depot
for the sale of this invaluable invention is at 13, Duke-street, Grozvenor.
square. Its advantages are too many to be enumerated in an advertise¬
ment, but it may be mentioned that by its heip from five to 10 minutes'
boiling does the work of as many hours' boiling by ordinary methods of
cooking. Half-an-hour's use of fire on Saturday night will give a hot
dinner on Sunday. The flavour of the cooked food is far superior to
that of the ordinary, method. The loss of meat is but loz, as com¬
pared with 11b, of loss by ordinary cooking. It is this apparatus which
constitutes the cheap and simple refrigerator for preserving ice, &c.,
respecting which the letters have appeared in The Times of July 30 and
31. Three medals at the Paris Exhibition. The invention has been
noticed with strong approval by The Times, Pall-mall Gazette, and
other journals.

TO SQUATTERS, Agents, Shippers, and others
interested in the exportation of wools, &c.—Gentlemen.—Having
erected new and spacious Stores on the Circular Quay, contiguous to
the Wool-pressing Establishment of Messrs. Talbot and Son, we are
now prepared to RECEIVE WOOL, Sheepskins, &c., for DISPOSAL,
according to the instructions received from the owners, shippers, &c.
We will sell privately or by auction, make advances, and consign to
our agents in London, or will store the wool and superintend-its ship¬
ment by first-class ships to any English house, as instructed. Bills of
lading can be obtained in 24 hours after the receipt of the wool, and
being so near the wool presses, there will be no delay in getting the
wool shipped, thus relieving the wool grower or other consignee of all
trouble. Wool intended for shipment or storage, and not for sale, will
be kept separate and private. If required we will pay the carriers
and select supplies for return drays; all we require is to have
full instructions, which will be faithfully and punctually carried
out, and, having secured the services of Mr. J. G. Church,
whose long experience, both in the sale of wool and purchasing sup¬
plies, extends over some years, we trust will be a sufficient guarantee
in thus enabling us to give every satisfaction to those faveuring us
with their patronage. A doating policy will be held over the stores.
The terms will be according to arrangement, or on the following
scale, viz.:—Receiving, weighing, and delivering clean wool, at 1z.
per bale; greasy wool, at 1s. 3d. per bale. For selling, a commission
of 1 per cent. For cash advanced to pay carriers, or to make pur¬
chases, &c., 27 per cent. Parties wishing to store wool can be ac¬
commodated as per agreement.

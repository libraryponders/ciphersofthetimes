INFRINGEMENT of COPYRIGHT.—"A Picture¬
Book of Birds and Beasts for the Young."—Messrs. SAMPSON
LOW, SON, and MARSTON are desired by the Proprietor of the
above Book, published by them on his account, to acknowledge that
since its publication he has discovered with much regret that some of
the woodents used in the illustration of the work were, without the
knowledge of himself or the publishers, fac-similed from copyright en¬
gravings in "Yarrell's British Birds" and "Bell's British Quadrupeds,"
published by Mr. Van Voorst. Messrs. Sampson Low, Son, and
Marston having withdrawn from the publication of the work, Mr. Van
Voorst takes this opportunity of intimating his intention of maintain¬
ing henceforth in matters of copyright his full legal rights.
CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements:
pear daily, stating that the
advertisers can reproduce cartede visite portraits, I. CAMILLE
SILVY (as far as I am concerned), CAUTION all persons against such
proceedings, which infringe the acts for protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to
secure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number); and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first,

cellent descriptions, and such as have hitherto been rarely brought into
the European markets, the agency having been established some years

brands, instead of cigars of British and continental make, so constantly
paimed off by the dealers. Consumers can select their brands and be

THE HEIRS of TORNAUER, nee GORGAS.—
Whereas the widow of the merchant Tornauer, called Caroline
Henriette, nee Gorgas, died on the 10th of July, 1871, at Storkow, all
whom it may concern are informed that the will of the above being
illegal in form, the property will be distributed according to law. As
none of the legal heirs have been found, all those laying CLAIM to
the INHERITANCE of the widow TORNAUER, nee GORGAS, are
herewith requested to forward their claims at the latest on the 29th
of September, 1874, in the forenoon, at 10 o'clock, into our office, for
the purpose of claim and proof. The deceased was duly and legally
married, according to the register of the Dreifaltigkeits Kirche
(Trinity Church) at Berlin on the 20th of December, 1814, to the citi¬
zen, proprietor and merchant, Jehann Friedrich Tornaner, of Ber¬
lin, and she is mentioned in the marriage register as the only legal
daughter of the deceased watchmaker, Johann Friedrick Gorgas. Her
aforesaid husband died on the 8th of May, 1826, at Berlin, and a son,
issue of this marriage, Dr. Med. Albert Emanuel Tornauer, died 7th
of February, 1871, at Storkow. In case a claimant should appear, the
residue of 45,000 thalers, left by the widow Tornauer, née Gorgas, will
relapse to the State as unclaimed property. Any applicant after pre¬
clusion has to acknowledge and accept all acts and dispositions of the
Government, and can neither demand accounts nor compensation of
fucurred expenses, but must be satisfied with that which may be left
of the inheritance.—Storkow, Nov. 1, 1873. Konigl Kreisgerichts

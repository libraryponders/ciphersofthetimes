UDGMENT.—TRADE MARK COUNTER¬
FEITED.—Office of Mr. E. Caron, attorney of the Civil Tribunal
of the First Instance of the Department of the Seine, No. 45, Rue
Richelieu, Paris.—The following extract has been made from a judg¬
ment of the Sixth Chamber of the said Tribunal of the Seine, trying
misdemeanours, dated 12th January, 1865, registered, confirmed by a
decree of the Imperial Court of March 31, 1865 ; the judgment and
decree having been pronounced after the adverse party had been heard,
between Messrs. BASS and Co., brewers, of Burton-on-Trent, in
England, and Mr. Benjamin Harris, provision dealer, of 265, Rue St.
Honoré, Paris:—
"The Tribunal, on the ground that labels were selzed in the house
of Harris, bearing the inscription " India Pale Ale, and that he
acknowledged having ordered them, and to have had them made; that
the labels have a general appearance and a resemblance of form,
design, and colour, likely to deceive the buyer and to make him believe
that they are the mark of the English house, Bass and Co., and that
the articles they are put upon come from that house;
"That though Harris substituted the word "India for those of
Bass and Co.," and though he cut off in a slight degree the corners of
the red triangle which is one of the most conspicuous features, these
changes are not sufficient to make this mark appear to the consumers
a different one from that of Bass and Co.
Condemus Harris to four months' imprisonment and a fine of
600 francs; condemus him, by all legal ways, even by arrest, to pay to
Bass and Co. the sum of 6,000 franes as damages;
beclares to be confiscated the labels seized, and which are a
fraudulent imitation of those of Bass and Co., and directs them to be
destroyed."

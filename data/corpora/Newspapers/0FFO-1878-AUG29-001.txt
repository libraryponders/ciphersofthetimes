IN the TRUSTEESHIP of WILLIAM MARTIN,
late of the parish of St. Martin, Worcester, Builder, deceased.—
The said William Martin, who died in the year 1858, gave by his will a
share of the moneys arising from the sale of his real estate to the
eldest surviving child of his brother James at the decease of his wife,
who died in the year 1864. It is supposed that the said James Martin
went to reside in London prior to the decease of his brother, and mar¬
ried; that he afterwards went to reside in New York, leaving his
family in London, and died in 1850. Notice is hereby given, that un¬
less the ELDEST SURVIVING CHILD of the said JAMES MAR¬
TIN shall come forward and establish his CLAIM to the said SHARE
on or before the 30th day of October next the surviving trustee under
the will of the said William Martin will pay over the said share to the
party or parties who shall be legally entitled to the same.

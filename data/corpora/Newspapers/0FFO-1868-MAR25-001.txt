for Widening and Improving certain Streets in the town of Liverpool,
and for other purposes," and of an Act passed in the 5th year of the
reign of Her Majesty, entitled "An Act to make further Previsions for
the Administration of Justice," all persons claiming to be the HEIRS¬
AT-LAW of MARGARET HARRISON, late of Liverpeol, in the
county of Lancaster, widow of the said Johs Harrison, formerly of the
same place, gentleman, deceased, are, by their solicitors, on or before
the 4th day of May, 1868, to come in and prove their claims at the
chambers of the Vice-Chancellor Sir Richard Malins, at No. 3, Stone¬

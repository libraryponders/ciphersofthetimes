been assigned the pleasing task of expressing to you on behalf of th
passengers of the Baltic their most cordial ACKNOWLEDGMEN
of your skill as a mariner, and of the nobleness of your heart. Ofte
have some of us crossed the occap, but never have we met with a com
mander who was more attentive to his duties and to the comfort an
welfare of his passengers than you have been during the trip just abou
closing. Long may you live and prosper, and carry with you the kin
remembrances of those whom you cared for to bring to the Easter
Hemisphere. But, captain, not to you alone do we accord our praise
for the pleasant journey just performed. To all the officers of the Ba
tic we feel deeply obliged for kindness so bountifully bestowed.
would be a difficult task to single out any one where all have strivent
augment our comforts, and where so much intelligence and self-saer
fice has been manifested we can have only one feeling of gratitud
towards all, which we now tender to those who have so richly deserve
it. But, captain, let us not forget at this moment, when our best fee
ings are aroused, that our most saored thanks are due to Him who ruld
the universe, and, with grateful hearts to the Allgiving God, we onc
more tendor you our warmest thanks.

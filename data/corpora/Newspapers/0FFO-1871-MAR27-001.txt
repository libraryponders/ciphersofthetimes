As the boundaries laid down on the Government Maps were pointed
out to the Ordnance Surveyors by Meresmen, or persons appointed by
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembled in Quarter Sesaions, as
directed by the Acts of Farliament quoted above, the maps may pos¬
sibly become evidence respecting the boundaries, and thus affect the
right of rating lands. Therefore, proprietors, agents, and other persons
to whom this Notice is addressed, are particularly requested to ex¬
amine the Sketch Maps, to ascertain that the boundaries of those lands
in and for which they are interested have been corectly defined and
laid down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for compa¬
rison with the Boundary Sketch Maps, that, should any differences be
found, they may be inquired into, and corrected before the maps are
engraved and published.

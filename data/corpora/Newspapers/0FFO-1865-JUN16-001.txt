WARNING to TRAVELLERS.—The Proprietors
of some hotels at Berlin have for some time endeavoured to
mislead the travelling public by circulating false statements respecting
some of the most frequented HOTELS of BERLIN, stating that the
latter are either full, too expensive, too distant, or unclean. These re¬
ports have been circulated partly by means of handbills thrown into rail¬
way carriages, partly by their commissioners sent to the railways for the
purpose of enticing travellers on arrival into their hotels. While de¬
nouncing these statements as false and calumnious, we beg the travel¬
ling public will give no credit to such and similar reports, obviously
circulated to increase their custom by false pretences, but to take up
their abodes as usual in those hotels best known or recommended to
them. The undersigned hotel proprietors further beg to inform the
travelling public that they only send their carriages and commissioners
to the railway termini when the arriving travellers order the same
beforchand.

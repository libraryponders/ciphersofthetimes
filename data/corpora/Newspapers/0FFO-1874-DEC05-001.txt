As the boundaries laid down on the Government maps were pointed
ont to the Ordnance Surveyors by meresmen, or persons appointed by
Hler Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembled in Quarter Sessions, as
directed by the Acts of Parlament quoted above, the maps may pos¬
sibly become evidence respecting the poundaries, and thus allect the
right of rating lands. Therefore, proprietors, agents, and other persons
to whom this notice is addressed, are particularty requested to examine
the sketch maps, to ascertain that the boundaries of those lands in
and for which they are interested have been correctly defined and laid
down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for comparison
with the boundary sketch maps, that, should any differences be
found, they may be inquired into and corrected before the maps are
engraved and published.

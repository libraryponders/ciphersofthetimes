NOTICE.—BROKERS.—City of London.—
Whereas, by an Act of Parliament passed in the 6th year of the
reign of her late Majesty, Queen Anne, it is enacted "That all per¬
sons that shall act as Brokers within the city of London and Liberties
thereof shall from time to time be admitted by the Court of Mayor
and Aldermen of the said city for the time being, under such restric¬
tions and limitations for their honest and good behaviour as
that Court shall think fit and reasonable"; and by an Act of Parlia¬
ment passed in the 57th year of the reign of his late Majesty, King
George III., after reciting the said first-mentioned Act, it is enacted
"That if any person shall take upon him to act as a Broker, or emplov,
or cause, permit, or suffer any person or persons to be employed with,
under, or for him, to act as such within the said city and liberties,
not being admitted in pursuance of the said recited Act, every such per¬
son so offending shall forfeit and pay to the use of the Mayor and
Commonalty and citizens of the said city, for every such offence, the
sum of £100, to be recovered by action of debt, in the name of the
Chamberlain of the said city, in any of his Majesty's Courts of Re¬
cord"; and whereas, there is great reason to believe that many persons
who are not admitted by the Court of Mayor and Aldermen de exercice
the office of a Broker, and employ others under them to act as such,
within the said city and liberties, in contempt and violation of the law,
to the great injury and prejudice of those who are duly admitted to be
brokers of this city, and to the manifest hazard of merchants and
others employing persons who are under no restrictions or limitations.
nor have given bond with sureties for their honest and good behaviour,
as brokers regularly admitted by the Court of Aldermen are subjected
to ;—Notice is therefore hereby given, that whoever will give IN¬
FORMATION, either to the Comptroller, at his office in Guildhall, or
to Mr. John Thornton, 2, Guildhall-chambers, Basinghall-Street,
receiver of brokers rents, of any offence committed contrary to the
said Act, shall receive a REWARD of FIFTY POUNDS on convic¬
tion of the offender, who will be prosecuted on such information at

WOODTHORPE.

LE STRANGE MEMORIAL FUND.—Many of
the friends of the late Mr. LE STRANGE having expressed a
wish to mark their sense of his high character, and of his services to
the cause of ecclesiastical art, by a PUBLIC MEMORIAL, a Com¬
mittee, of which the Dean of Ely has consented to act as chairman,
has been formed to carry this wish into effect.
The Committee have come to the conclusion that the most suitable
memorial would be the continuation of the work of restoring the parish
church of Hunstanton. Some years ago, Mr. Le Strange, aided by his
friends and by the parishioners, restored, with great cost and care, the
nave of this church; and it is known that, had his life been spared, he
fully intended to devote all his energies to the completion of the restora¬
tion so soon as his great work at Ely Cathedral should be finished.
Mr. Hamon Le Strange has given his consent to this memorial, and
has expressed his wish that the Committee would accept, towards their
undertaking, the timber cut down some years since, and devoted by his
father to the restoration of the chancel.

BATHS of HOMBURG near Frankfort-on-the¬
Maine. — Summer Season 1866.—The Mineral Waters of Homburg,
as evidenced by the analysis of the celebrated Professor Liebig, are
stimulant, tonic, alterative, and aperient. They are of admirable
service in removing disorders of the stomach and other intestines. They
stimulate these organs when the abdominal circulation is defective,
assist the process of secretion, and give a healthful regularity to the
orgasm of nutrition and assimilation. They are powerful remedial
agents in cases of enlargement of the liver, in affection of the spleon.
in hypochondria, jaundice, heemorrhoidal disease, and obstinate con¬
stipation. In cases of gout, and all other affections produced by in¬
efficiency of the digestive functions, the most happy results have been
obtained from them.
The efficacy of the Waters is more especially recognized by those
who drink them at their source ; for then, the invigorating air of the
mountains, the gaiety of the surrounding scene, and perfect abstraction
from the cares of the world concur in assisting the action of the medici¬
nal beverage.
The magnificent Kurhouse, which, in the beauty of its architecture,
the judicious distribution of its apartments, and the richness of its
decorations surpasses every other edifice of the kind on the banks of
the Rhine, contains a variety of spacious and splendidly decorated rooms;
grand saloon for balls and concerts; a superb dining room, where there
is a table d'hote à la Francaise twice a day, at 1 and at 5 o'clock, fur¬
nished by the celebrated Chevet of Paris, who is the lessee of the re¬
freshments of the whole Casino. The visitors will likewise find a large
and comfortable reading room, well supplied with German, English,
French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Swedish, Belgian, and Dutch
daily papers. Besides the above attractions there are also several con¬
versation rooms, as well as a splendid coffee room with three billard
tables.
To complete the charms of Homburg—this delightful place—a troop
of Italian actors of the highest talent, conducted by the celebrated
Maestro Orsini, has been engaged to perform the choicest pieces of the
Italian repertory. The services of the renowned prime-donne Adelina
Patti, Trebelli, the sisters Marchisio, &c., have likewise been secured
for this season.
An excellent orchestre, numbering 40 distinguished musicians, per¬
forms three times a day—in the morning at the Wells, in the afternoon
in the beautiful gardens of the Casino, and in the evening in the grand

The new railway has almost brought Homburg Baths to the outskirts
of Frankfort. There are 20 trains a day to and fro, the last as late
as 11 o'clock. As the journey occupies only half an hour the amuse¬
ments of Frankfort are within easy reach. Visitors in Homburg may
get to Brussels in 12 hours, to Berlin in 15, to Paris in 16, and to
London in 24, so excellent is the inter-communication by rail.

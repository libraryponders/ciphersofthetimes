ANCASHIRE OPINION.—The Publisher regrets
that, owing to extreme pressure at the last moment, a consider¬
able portion of the impression of the second number of this Journal
had to be printed on paper of an inferior quality. This will not occur
again; meanwhile, these annual subscribers who purpose hinding the
work in vols, may receive fair copies, printed on paper uniform in
quality with the first and future numbers, by application to the pub¬
lisher, 26, Market-street, Manchester.
ELKINGTON and Co., Paventees of the Electro'
Plate, desire to impress upon public attention the fact that al
articles of their guaranteed manufactine are distinctly stamped with
their trade mark, E. and Co., under a crown, in a shield—the represen¬
tation now so frequently made, that articles, ofton of the most inferior
description, are plated by Elkington and Co.'s process, is entirely value¬
less as a criterion of quality. In the case of "Elkington v. Johnson,
recently tried before Vice-Chancellor James, defendant having unlaw¬
fully used their marks, a perpetual injunction was granted restraining
defendant frem using or imitating their name ur trade marks; and
Elkington and Co. give notice that they will take LEGAL PROCEED¬
INGS against all persons USING or IMITATING their NAME or
TRADE MARKS. Manufactory, Newhall-street. Birmingham

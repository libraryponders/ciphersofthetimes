MIRST MEETING in CHEAPSIDE. — Taree
months' residence in a Christian famlly.—Journey to Barnet
taken. Last interviews on Saturday and Sunday evenings, the latter
one very ratisfactory Mr. —, at Herne-bay. You will understand
who I am from all this. Have you received both my letters, directed
to same place? Your step has plunged us all in deep distress, espe¬
cially myself. Why did you not unfold all to me firet, and take my
advice before acting? I deeply blame you for this, but for nothing
else, as I know nothing. Was such a fearful step absolutely neces¬
sitated? Don't rush too far into the arms of your foes, or compromise
yourself too deeply to withdraw again. Recollect who are your real
friends. Will you return to them at once? All is arranged for it, and
better and safer arrangements will at once be made. We can protect
you from further annoyance. If not me, will you consent to see Mr.
R., who called on you before? Trust us, we are Christians, and can
forgive if the truth be fully stated. Be comforted; all may yet be
well.—Yours, SYMPATHY.

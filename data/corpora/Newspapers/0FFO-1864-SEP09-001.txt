To bring together highly respectable nurses for the lying-in chamber,
to facilitate the acquisition of wet nurses of good constitution, and
those who are adapted for the bringing up of infants who may be de¬
prived of maternal care.
The next department will consist of fever nurses (separated from
others), who will undertake the management of all contagious diseases,
and further to provide respectable persons to wait upon chronic in¬
valids, those addicted to habits of intemperance, or suffering from any
temporary or sudden aberration of intellect; and lastly, it is intended
to carry out a communication between nurses arriving from India and

LARAT.—Copy.—Off the Lizard, June 5, 1865. Dear Sir,—
Before leaving the good ship Ballarat we, the undersigned pas¬
sengers, desire to thank you and Mrs. Allan most sincerely for your
uniform kindness and attention to our comforts during our pleasant
passage from Wellington, New Zealand, to England, and also to ex¬
press our great admiration at the manner in which the vessel has been
handled. We have felt that whatever difficulties we might encounter
we were under the command of one fully equal (under Providence) to
meet them; the unremitting attention of yourself and officers has
been noticed by us with great satisfaction. To Mr. Davidson, also,
your able chief officer, we likewise desire to express our thanks for his
courteous behaviour to us on all occasions. Wishing you all happiness
and prosperity.
We are, with very kind regards, ever yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen—On behalf of myself, Mrs. Allan, and the

It has ever been our aim to promote the welfare of all on board, and
it is a great gratification to us, at the termination of this most plea¬

Thoroughly reciprocating the good wishes contained in your letter,

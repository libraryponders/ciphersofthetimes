THE PATENT NECROPOLIS EARTH to
EARTH COFFIN.—This coffin possesses the strength, appear¬
ance, and the other essentials of a solid coffin; but is constructed of
materials that will not interfere with the resolvent action of the earth
and natural dissolution of the body; in fact, it fulfils most effectually
all the requirements for carrying out the principle of Earth to Earth
burial, and that without offending in any way the natural feelings
which surround this question. It can be seen at the Company's
offices. To Mr. Seymour Haden is due the credit of having exposed
the evis arising from the practice of burying the dead in wooden or
other imperishable ceffias. In his veries of able letters to The Times,
he points offt that at present "the dead are little more than nomi¬
nally buried and that by the interposition between them and the carth
that should resolve thein of such media as wood, lead, brick, and the
like, interment as a principle is rendered all but nugatory, and as a
practice deprived of its raison d'être," and, moreover, "has led us to
accumulate in our midst a vast store of human remains in every stage
and condition of decay," a state of things revolting in the extreme,
and highly dangerous to the health of the community at large.
The LONDON NECROPOLIS COMPANY undertakes the whole
arrangements of the funeral without the intervention of the ordinary
undertaker at any stage of the proceedings. All that is necessary is
that, in the case of death, notice of the event should be sent imme¬
diately to the office.

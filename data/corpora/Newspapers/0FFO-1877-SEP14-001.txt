—I made a mistake the last time I wrote here, on
the 6th inst., in referring to what I had said before. It seemed
as if I had written the day before instead of the 29th ult. There were
a few words on the 5th with R. prefixed that looked like mine, but
were not. I hope you will be able to distinguish mine from others.
I fear there is some mischief afloat. Good bye.—A.

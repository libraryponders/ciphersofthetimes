To the TEADEALERS of GREAT BRITAIN.
Teadealers' and Grocers' Association, 43, Eastcheap.
Gentlemen,
NOU are doubtless aware of the proposal made by the
China merchants to withdraw the customary allowance of one
pound draft on all packages of tea weighing over 28 15st, and to adopt
the Customs tares. We ask you to co-operate to oppose this arbitrary
withdrawal of a custom established by immemorial usage which rules
in all other articles in the grocery trade, and is regarded as an equi¬
table adsjustment to prevent the endless complaints of insufficient
tares which must otherwise arise.
A Committee sits daily at the above offices to organize a determined
opposition to this ehange; you will greatly facilitate their operations
by at once communicating your views.
A General Meeting will be held at the Cannon-street Hotel, on
Monday, June 13, at 3 o'clock, when a definite line of action will be
proposed. James Abbiss, Esq., has kindly consented to preside, and
will be supported by Messrs. Ridgway and Co., Phillips and Co.,
Augustus Teetgen, W. and G. Law, Lawson Robinson, Gold, Brothers,
Hawkins and Son, and other leading members of the trade. Your at¬
tendance on that occasion is specially requested.
signed, on behalf of the Committee,
J. DICKENSON BETTS, Chairm.

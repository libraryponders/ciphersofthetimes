NOTICE.—Technical Education.—The Silver Trade
and the City Companies.—The duty of 20 per cent. upon silver
spoons and forks, and of 124 per cent. upon articles of daily use, is an
insurmountable obstacle to the art-progress of the silver trade. Mem¬
bers of Parliament (especially) and others interested in the success of
technical education are earnestly requested to lend a heiping hand, in
order that the TAX (at once unjust and impolitic) may be
ABOLISHED during next session, so that the silver trade may par¬
take of the advantages offered by the scheme about to be propounded
by the City Companies. For further particulars address Edward J.
Watherston, Silversmith, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

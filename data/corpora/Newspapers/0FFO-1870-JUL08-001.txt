IN the MATTER of NICO

aedings against
In compliance with the injunction which 
th h ave recently obtained,
my solicit
te esrs Plows and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed

oe e your costs. I have also directed.
te to be prepared of


colonies up to the date of the
ossible,
injunction. These will, as speedily as
furnished to you, as
well as a state
ti e

contravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest should be determined by some London or colonial
merchaut to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
"I hope that you will do me the justice to believe that, previous to the
commencement of litigation between us, I sincerely thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact configuration described in your speci¬
fication and drawing attached so the patent. I, therefore, did not
imagine that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counse
clanned it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such. I
now understand, consists in the formation of material into a garment.
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, so that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the knowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of damages, I have no

remain, yours, &c.,

To bring together highly respectable nurses for the lying-in chamber.
to facilitate the acquisition of wet nurses of good constitution, and

prived of maternal care.
The next department will consist of fever nurses (separated from
others), who will undertake the management of all contagious diseases,
and further to provide respectable persons to wait upon chronic in¬
valids, those addicted to habits of intemperance, or suffering from any
temporary or sudden aberration of intellect; and lastly, it is intended
to earry out a communication between nurses arriving from India and
the Colonies (natives and others), and thus to provide families with
proper attendants for distant voyages.

ticulars of the case being supplied to the Secretary or the Superin¬
tendent.

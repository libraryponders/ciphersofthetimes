PETITION.—The GOVERNMENT BILL to make
further provision respecting the CLOSING of BURIAL
GROUNDS which are injurious to health, and to facilitate the esta¬
blishment of new burial grounds, &c., stands for Second Reading in
the House of Lords, April 20th.
People of England? If you think it only reasonable and just to
England that her opinion so clearly expressed (i the last Parliament
by a majority of four, in the present by a majority of 101) against the
Liberationists' Burials Bill should be respected by Ireland and Scot¬
land, support the Government Bill, which desires to legisiate justly
for all classes.
Ireland and Scotland have their own Burial Laws; it is reasonable
that England have hers.

tioners regard the Burial Acts Consolidation Bill as a measure to se¬

Honourable" House to pass the said Bill.
And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

As the boundaries laid down on the Government maps were pointed
out to the Ordnance Surveyors by meresmen, or persons appointed by
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace assembied in Quarter Sessions, as
directed by the Acts of Parlament quoted above, the maps may pos¬
sibly become evidence respecting the boundaries, and thus affect the
right of rating lands, Therefore, proprietors, agents, and other persons
to whom this notice is addressed, are particularly requested to examine
the sketch maps, to ascertain that the boundaries of those lands in
and for which they are interested have been correctly defined and laid
down, and to bring with them plans of their estates for comparison
with the boundary sketch maps, that, should any differences be
found, they may be inquired into and corrected before the maps are
engraved and published.

of the district hereby defined, must give notice to the Police, or to
Mr. Samuel James Rayment, the City's Cattle Inspector, who will

are proposed to be removed, and, provided they are found to be in a
healthy condition, a license will be issued for their removal.
If any person moves any cattle within the area above described,

THE GREAT MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM
SOLVED.—A Friendly Caution to Mathematicians, Professors.
and Teachers not to persist in Error.—The number in general use,
3,141,592,653,589 carried on with hundrads of decimal fract ons, is con¬
fessedly admitted to be only a near approximation to the true, hitherto
ungnown measure of the circumference of the circle. By my new
method of employing lines and circles in motion I demonstrate the
truc measure of the circumference, area, and quadrature of the circle.
This grand discovery was published by Thomas Keil, 40, King-street.
Covent-garden, and advertised in The Times dated 17th, 20th, and 22d
of July, 1875. The demonstration has been two years before the nation
and the world. It is surely time that this discovery should be univer¬
sally adopted, and the present erroneous measure of the circumference
cease to be taught in all colleges and schools, or employed by astro¬
nomers in computing the distance of the sarth from the sun. The
tenor of some recent publications impels me to give this friendly cau¬
tion. I invite communications, and am ready to confirm by freshly
constructed examples the absolute truth of my new method of
employing lines and crcles in motion.—DANIEL WEST, Discoverer
of the Quadrature of the Circle by Demonstration, 69, Euston-square,
London, March 29, 1877.

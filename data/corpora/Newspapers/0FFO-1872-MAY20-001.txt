capital has arrived a young English lady, apparently between 18

slight, and good looking, having short, dark bair and very dark eves

DUC de MONTEBELLOS CHAMPAGNES.—
Caution.—Whereas, an INJUNCTION in Chancery has been
obtained in the cause "Due de Montebello y Gemmer," restraining
the defendant and all others from selling or parting with sundry cases
of Rhenish wine, imported from Rotterdam, containing bottles bearing
imitation Duc de Montebello's labels and corks, and further probi¬
biting the impostation or sale of all wines bearing such imitation labels
or corks; and whereas in the cause "Duc de Montebello v. Jebens,"
tried in the Tribunal Gorrectionnel of Havre, a parcel of 250 cases.
containing 3,000 bottles of wine, bearing imitation Duc de Montebello
labels and corks, seized by the French Customs' authorities (the said
spurious wines having been sent from Germany and Havre to be
thence shipped to England, and thus through the colourable importa¬
tiop from a French port to avoid detection on arrival here), were ad¬
judged to be confiscated; all persons are hereby cautioned against deal¬
ing with spurious champagnes, bearing imitation Duc de Montebello
labels and corks.

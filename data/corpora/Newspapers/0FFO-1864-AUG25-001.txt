PROCLAMATION PROHIBITING the IMPOR¬
TATION of CATTLE from the COLONY of TASMANIA.—
By the Honourable John Hyde Harris, Superintendent of the Pro¬
vince of Otago.—Whereas, by proclamation in the Provincial Govern¬
ment Gazette, issued under the public seal of the province of
Otago, at Dunedin, the 18th day of January last, I, John Hyde Harris,
Superintendent of the said Province, by virtue of the powers delegated
to and vested in me in that behalf, did thereby proclaim and declare that
from and after the date thereof all the Australian ports, with the ex¬
ception of Gipps Land and Mornington, should be deemed infected dis¬
tricts, places, or ports, within the meaning and for the purposes of the
Diseased Cattle Act, 1861;" and whereas, by another proclama¬
tion in the said Gazette, issued as aforesaid, upon the 16th day of
February thereafter, I, by virtue of the said powers did thereby
rescind the said exceptions, and did proclaim and declare that
from and after the date thereof Gipps Land and Mornington
should be deemed to be infected districts, ports, or places,
within the meaning and for the parposes of the aforesaid Act;
and whereas, doubts have arisen whether by the proclamation first
above recited the importation of cattle from the colony of Tasmania
into the province of Otago was prohibited and it is expedient to re¬
move these doubts;—Now, therefore, I, the said John Hyde Harris, by
virtue of the powers delegated to and vested in me in this behalf, do
hercby proclaim and declare that from and after the date hereof the
colony of Tasmania, and all ports and places therein, shall be deemed
infected districts, ports or places, within the meaning and for the pur¬
poses of the "Diseased Cattle Act. 1861," and that no cattle from and
after the date hereof until further notice shall be imported into the
province of Otago from the colony of Tasmania aforesaid.
Given under my band, and issued under the public seal of
(L. S.)
the province of Otago at Dunedin, this 6th day of May,
1864.

CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements appear daily, stating that the
advertisers can reproduce carte de visite portraits, 1, CAMILLE
SILVY (as far as I am concerned), CAUTION all persons against such
proceedings, which infringe the acts for protection of property in
works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photograths
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to se¬
cure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number); and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

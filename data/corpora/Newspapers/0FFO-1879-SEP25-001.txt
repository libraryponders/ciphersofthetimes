THE Rev. J. W. HORSLEY and the ARGYLL
ROOMS.—In October, 1878, the Rev. J. W. Horsley, Chaplain
of H.M. Prison, Clerkenwell, wrote a letter, by request, to a Member
of the Middlesex Bench of Mazistrates, describing what he believed
to be the evil results consequent upon the licence hitherto given to the
Argyll Rooms.
After full disenssio n e
istrates refused to ronew the licence.

proprictor of the Argyll Rooms, thereupon brought
an action for libel against Mr. Horsley, claiming £10,000 damages.
The case was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench on the 1st and 2d
May, 1878, when the jury, having failed to agree upon their verdict,
were discharged.
Mr. Horslay thus became liable for his own costs, which amounted
to £350. His salary as Prison Chaplain is £250 per annur
A Subscription List was opened by the Rev. Randall T. Davidson,
Lamboth Palace, the Rev. C. D. Laurence, Rector of Bermondsey,
and others, to defray Mr. Horsley's costs. This end has now been
achieved without putting Mr Hordey to any
ANO FURTHER SUBSCRIPTIONS are REQUIRED.

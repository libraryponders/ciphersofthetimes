THE HOME and FOREIGN INQUIRY OFFICE,
14, George-street, Mansion-house, E.C.—Mr. POLLAKY, who
founded the above establishment in 1841 for the purpose of furnishing
prompt and authentic information of the past career and character of
foreigners and others in this country and abroad, will continue to make
private inquiries, with the view of testing the respectability of persons
who, under fictitious, high-sounding titles, introduce themselves into
English society ; as shown by numerous reports in the daily press. The
system of espionage, so justly condemned and so firmly repudiated by
the British public, forms no element in the important as well as legiti¬
mate prosecution of these delicate investigations. Since the opening
of this office the desirability of its permanent existence has been de¬
monstrated by the numerous cases in which its assistance has been
sought by all classes of society. Mr. Pollaky in strictly adhering to
these principles hopes for a continuation of the confidence of the public,
to obtain which he has striven during the past 10 years. On the 15th
of every month a special employé of this office will leave for the conti¬
inent to execute confidential inquiries at those places where no consti¬

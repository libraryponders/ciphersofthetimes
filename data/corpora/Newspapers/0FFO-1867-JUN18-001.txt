MISS CHANDLER gratefully ACKNOWLEDGES
a variety of beautiful CONTRIBUTIONS, in Aid of the Grand
Fancy Sale for the Paralysed and Epileptic, and solicits the indulgence
of ladies whose kind help she has not been able to acknowledge owing

RELOVED SON.—Your secret departure from home
has caused us more anguish and suffering than I can express.
In reply to this appeal I beseech you to come home, or write and tell me
where I can meet you. I now know all the causes of your depression,
besides the debts you acknowledge. Most truly do I grieve for and
with you, and my heart yearns to tell you that I forgive you. Do not
spurn a mother's love, but believe that she feels for you and that her
one desire is to see you and forward your wishes as to your future
prospects. We are striving to keep all quiet in the hope you will at
once let us hear from you, for you cannot but feel that the step you have
taken in leaving home clandestinely must bring disgrace upon us as well
as upon yourself. It is with difficulty I can fulfil my duties calmly in
the anxious suspense I am suffering on your account.

ADVERTISEMENT.—Rumours calumniously re¬
flecting upon the reputation of the Journal des Débats with re¬
gard to its foreign policy having circulated at the commencement of
the year, and having their origin in an article published in the Daily
News of the 20th December, 1866, the latter journal, in their impres¬
sion of the 8th instant, published the following RETRACTATION:—
The "Journal des Debats" and the "Daily News."
"On the 20th December last a statement appeared in the ordinary
dally communication from our Paris correspondent which professed to
be the account of an alleged meeting of shareholders in the Journal
des Debats, under the presideney of M. Edouard Bertin. It repre¬
sented that a report had been made to such meeting that the
dividends of the shareholders had been largely augmented by
payments from the Prussian and Italian Governments to the
Journal des Débats, on account of copies of that newspaper
subscribed for but not forwarded, and the letter further asserted
that such sums had been paid and accepted as the consideration for
the support awarded by the Journal des Debats to the policy pursued
by those Governments in their conffict with Austria. Having had
reason since the appearance of this letter, which was necessarily pub¬
lished in haste, with but little opportunity for consideration to suspect
its accuracy, we have been at considerable pains to ascertain the facts,
and are now satisfied upon the most respectable assurances that the
statements referred to are absolutely destitute of truth, that no such
meeting was held, as it would be contrary even to the constitution of
the newspaper, and that no sums whatever, whether under the name of
subscriptions or otherwise, have been paid to the Journal des Debats
or its management by either the Prussian or Italian Governments.
Under these circumstances we unhesitatingly retract the allegations
contained in the letter alluded to, as untrue and destitute of founda¬
tion, and greatly regret that insinuations so calumnious should have
found a place in this fournal to the detriment of our esteemed cotem¬
porary. We do this the more readily because we recognise the accusa¬
tions thus advanced as the most serious that can be levelled against a
newspaper; and notwithstanding this inadvertent and unfortunate
publication, we are free to say that there is no journal against which
we should be more sorry to advance so grievous a charge than the
Journal des Debats, which takes so important a part in the formation
of European opinion, and to the distinction of which our foreign
columns so often bear witness."—Daily News.

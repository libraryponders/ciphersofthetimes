DUC de MONTEBELLO's CHAMPAGNES.—
CAUTION.—Whereas an INJUNCTION in Chancery has been
obtained in the cause "Duc de Montebello v. Gemmer," restraining
the defendant and all others from selling or parting with sundry cases
of Rhenish wine, imported from Rotterdam, containing bottles bearing
imitation Duc de Montebello labels and corks, and further prohibiting
the importation or sale of all wines bearing such imitation labels or
corks; and whereas, in the cause "Duc de Montebello v. Jebens," tried
in the Tribunal Correctionel of Havre, a parcel of 250 cases, containing
3,000 bottles of wine bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels and
corks, seized by the French Customs authorities (the said spurious wines
having been sent from Germany and Havre to be thence shipped to
England, and thus, through the colourable importation from a French
port, to avoid detection on arrival here), were adjudged to be confis¬
cated; all persons are hereby cautioned against dealing with spurious
Champagnes bearing imitation Duc de Montebello labels and corks.
TAMPLIN and TAYLER, 159, Fenchurch-street, E.C.,
Solicitors to the Plaintiff.

AUC de MONTEBELLO's CHAMPAGNES.—
R. SYMONDS and SON direct the special attention of the trade
to the preceding CAUTION, as renewed attempts are being made to
introduce spurious wines, bearing forged Duc de Montebello labels and
corks. These spurious wines are mostly imported vis Rotterdam.
CAUTION.—The METROPOLITAN STEAM
BLEACHING and DYEING COMPANY find it necessary to
caution the public that they have only two branches in addition to
their works at 17. Wharf-road, City-road, viz.:—472, Oxford-street,
W.C., and 7, Pavilion-buildings, Brighton.
CAUTION.—MENIER's CHOCOLATE (Chocolat¬
Menier).—Important Notice.—To avoid being deceived by resem¬
blance in the form of the cakes colour of the covering, arrangement of
the label, and that quasi-similarity of names which imitators have in¬
vented for the purpose of passing off their chocolate as the Chocolat¬
Menier, the purchasers should look for the trade marks, the real name
upon the back of each division of the cake, and the signature Menier
upon the seal of the cover. Imitators try especially the fine quality
(vellow paper) at the price marked 2s. per pound, because it is this that
the public have particularly adopted; it gives the highest satisfaction
both for its low price and its excellent quality. Wholesale Menier,

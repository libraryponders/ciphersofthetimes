inventor in addressing the British public and submitting his invention
to their judgment, assumes that the countless number of human beings
who are now travelling daily upon railways and the fearful accidents
that are frequently happening from preventible causes demand that
some great effort should be made to urge the various railway com¬
panies to adopt some preventative measures against the occurrence
of these accidents, particularly such as are occasioned by the engine
or carriages running off the rail, the breaking of axletrees, &c. The
object of the inventor in exhibiting his improved system to the public
is that they may have the opportunity of testing its merits and
judging for themselves of its efficacy in preventing accidents.

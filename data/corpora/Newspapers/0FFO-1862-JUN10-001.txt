THE Court of Directors of the East India Company
do hereby give notice, that a GENERAL COURT of Proprietors
will be held as above, on Wednesday, 11th inst., at 12 o'clock.
A Proprietor (John Jones, Esq.) has given the following notices of

"That, in view of the refusal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
provide the necessary funds for the expenses of the East India Com¬
pany as by law required, it is expedient to consider how far the validity
of treaties made by the East India Company with European Powers
and with native Princes in the East, the advantages of which are now
enjoyed by the Crown, depends by the law of nations on the existence
of the East India Company, so far as those European Powers and
native Princes who are parties to the treaties are concerned."
That the official announcement of 25,000 notices of eviction to
tenant farmers in one district, issued by European Zemindars under
the new Government of the Crown in India, with the prospect of
80,000 more being about to follow, is an alarming feature in the prin¬
ciples of policy adopted by the new Administration
C. CRAUFURD, Secretary.

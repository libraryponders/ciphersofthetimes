Settlement Act, 1856," or "The Land Claims Settlement Extension
Act. 1858 (hereinatter called "the said Acts" which shall not be
prosecuted before the 31st day of December, 1879, shall be deemed to
have lapsed.
Whenever any selection of land is required to be made under the
provissons of the saie Acts, the Commissioners may prescribe a period
within which such selection shall be made, nd if the serection be not
made within such period, such right or selection shall lapse and be
deemed abandoned, and the claimant or claimants shall have no fur¬
ther right, title, or interest in respect of such claim, or in respect of
any land the subject of such claim.
In asy claim in which difficulties exist in the way of obtaining quiet
possession of the land to which the claimant is entitied, and in which
the survey of the claim cannot be made in a reasonable time, to be
fixed by the Commissioners, the Commissioners shall determine the
claim by directing a grant of other land in exchange, or by the issue
of scrip of equivaient value, exercisable only within twelve months
after issue thereof.
Notwithstanding anything in the said Acts contained, the Commis¬
sioners may admit to hearing the clamants in claims 64 (Captain

tions stated in the Act herein first mentioned, of which a copy may

FREE TRADE In SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliamout to ob¬
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articles of dally use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that no other sumilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political cconomy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacie to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths' work. The fax has been condemued as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

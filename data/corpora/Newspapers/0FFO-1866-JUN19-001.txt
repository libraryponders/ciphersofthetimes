previous edition of thig catalogue was published as a contribution to¬
wards the supply of this desideratum, and, as it met with so much suc¬
pess and so many expressions of approbation, Messrs. Cox and Son

great number of new Engravings. As the designs here illustrated are
executed at Messrs. Cox and Son's own workshops, they can combine
economy of production with excellency of workmanship and material,

practicable way of purifying water and thus avolding disease is

plicity and portability have been ebserved, coupled with the utmost
recreey and consequent security to the contents. It is fire-proof; and,
in discarding the hitherto shapened receptacles for the several articks,
the case is adapted to fit any jewel without the fear of the slightest
injury.—Howell, James, and Co., Regent-street.
CAUTION.—Water Filtration.—Before purchasing
filters the public is advised to read "Water, its Impurities and
Purification," price 2d., per post 3d. (to the medical and clerical pro¬
fessions gratis), as the majority of so-called filters are worse than use¬
less. Of the vital importance of pure water see leading article in
The Times of July 31st. The only substance which removes organic
and other poisonous ingredients in water is animal charcoal, with
which this Company's patent cistern and other filters are solely filled.

profession have adopted the patent cistern fiters, which can only be
had in London at the LONDON and GENERAL WATER-PURIFY.

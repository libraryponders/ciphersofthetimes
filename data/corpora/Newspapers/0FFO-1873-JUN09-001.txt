POLOGIES of the FREEMAN'S JOURNAL
and EVENING TELEGRAPH to the SIP CARPENTERS
of BELFAST.—Our readers are aware that we fell into the error of
believing that the ship carpenters of the Queen's Island took part in
the Belfost riots of August last. For this there was no foundati n
whatever; ann in consequence that bolly felt aggriesed at theunwar¬
rantable words applie i to them in the comments made by us at the
time. Careful local inquiry nas satisfied us that not one single member
of the ship carpenters body was imany way connected with thuse riots,
and therefore it is our duty, and justice to the menbers of that pony
requires us, to withdraw unconditionally the observations we male.
and which we do: and in amition tender to them our frang
APOLOGY for the error into which we fell and for the language used.
We feer it riaut tadd that we have bee met by the siup carpenters
in this matter, and by Mr. Charles H. Ward, their law adviter, in a
manner that proved that ample vin lication of cuaracter was their
only object.

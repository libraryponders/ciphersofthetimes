POLOGIES of the FREEMAN'S JOURNAL
and EVENING TELEGRAPH to the SHIP GARPENTERS
of BELFAST.—Our readers are aware that we fell into the error of
believing that the ship carpenters of the Queen's Island took part in
the Belfast riots of August last, For this there was no foundation
whatever; and in consequence that body felt aggrieved at thehnwar¬
rantalle words applie 1 to them in the comments made by us at the
time. Careful local inquiry has satisfied us that not one single member
of the ship carpenters body was in any way connected with those riots,
and therefore it is our duty, and justice to the members of that beny
requires us, to withdraw unconditionally the observations we made,
and which we do: and in addition tender to them our frank
APOLOGY for the error into whigh we fell and for the language used,
We feel it right to add that we have been met by the ship carpenters
in this matter, and by Mr. Charles H. Ward, their law adviser, in a
manner that proved that ample vindication of character was their
only object.

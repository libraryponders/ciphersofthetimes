FIGHT HUNDRED POUND PRIZES.—GRAND
NATIONAL EXHIBITION of SPORTING and other DOGS,
at the Great Ashburnham-hall, adjoining Cremorne, Chelsea, King's¬
road entrance.—Of late years great attention has been paid to the im¬
provement in the breed of dogs in this country. Indeed, the dog,
horse, and gun are the favourite companions of every Englishman,
and the former, in fact, of every English lady. It has been the prac¬
tice of getting up dog shows, and conducting the exhibition thereof
by various parties in such a manner that has made the exhibition more
a pain to the exhibitors of the animals than the pleasure of carrying off
a prize awarded by the judges, and often such prizes have never reached
the hands of the noble exhibitors. It is not so much for the value of
the prige to the gentleman exhibiting, as in the case of cattle, sheep,
&c., but the pride that he is enabled, by the study of the breed, to bring
before the public an animal that has cost him time, trouble, anxiety,
and money to rear up. Also, at the same time, it has never occurred
to parties to find a place suitable near to the west-end of
London. Under these circumstances, the proprietor of this elegant
structure, the Ashburnham-hall, so near to Hyde-park-corner,
has, at the suggestion of several noblemen, gentlemen, and
breeders of the dogs, determined to place the hall, in the month of
March, for a Grand Annual Exhibition of Dogs of every description—
bloodhounds, foxhounds, hariers, beagles, otter hounds, deerhounds,
grayhounds, pointers, setters, retrievers, Irish water spaniels, mastiffs,
Newfoundlands, Daimatian, bull and sheep, black, tan, and other ter¬
riers, pugs, Italian grayhounds, Blenheim, King Charles, &c. A separate
warm building will be arranged for all toy dogs, also a class for all
foreign dogs. Noblemen and gentlemen of high position will be
selected, whosethonour and impartiality in awarding the prizes to the
owners of the dogs of the different classes cannot be doubted. The
building will be thoroughly warmed by steam-pipes and lighted, and a
proper and efficient staff of persons will be appointed to attend to the
comforts of the dogs day and night. Mr. E.T. Smith, the proprietor,
whose name is well known to the public as their caterer for so many
years, has been appointed by the distinguished projectors of this annual
show to conduct the management, and he is determined that no effort
on his part shall be wanting to give satisfaction to all parties who may
wish to compete for the various valuable prizes in silver cups and
specie. Gentlemen desirous of subscribing as members and exhibitors,
who wish to send their dogs and compete for the prizes, are requested
to address their letters direct to Mr. E. T. Smith, Ashburnham-hall,

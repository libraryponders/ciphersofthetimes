still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that no other suilar trane is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3 subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (6 contrary to the
established laws of political sconomy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacte to technical education in its appli¬
cation to silversmiths' work. The fax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
ol opinion, and notably by the press of the Unsted Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the under-igned,

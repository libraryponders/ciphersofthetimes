FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—The
taxation of silver plate by means of an excise, and by the still
more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, by which

political economists, politicians of every shade of opinion, and notably
by the Press of the United Kingdom. A vigorous effort will be made
in the next Session of Parlament to secure for the silver trade a
sound, free-trade, commercial basis. Full particulars relating to the
subject may be obtained from Edward J. Watherston, 12, Pall-mall

lieve that more have been destroyed and the postage stamps in every
case dishonestly appropriated, they hasten to make this public an¬
nouncement of the fact, in order to remove from the minds of the
numerous customers who have been inconvenienced by this untoward
afair, the unfavourable impress on that the correspondence errange¬
ments of the establishmentgare negligently conducted. The Lilliputian

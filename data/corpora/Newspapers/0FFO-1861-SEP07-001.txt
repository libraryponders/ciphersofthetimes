TWENTY-FIRST ASCENT over the Fountains on Monday next,
September 9, at 5 o'clock precisely. To exhibit his wondrous and daring
feats, three enormous masts have been erected on the terrace, over
which has been strained the rope made expressly for this purpose, above
2,000 ft. in length. It has recently been raised many feet higher in the
centre, and approaches more nearly a straight line than any rope of
equal length ever before stretched. M. Blondin will on Monday per¬
form on it some of his most astounding feats. The fountains will be
played during the performance. The slopes and terraces at the Crystal
Palace afford ample accommodation for any possible number of visi¬
tors ; but, to provide for the accommodation of those who prefer it, a
few reserved seats are set apart in the Queen's box corridor (from which
M. Blondin takes his departure) at 5s. each; or on the other open corridors
at 2s. 6d. each. Frequent trains will run from London-bridge, Victoria,

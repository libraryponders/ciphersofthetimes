Gentlemen,
PERMIT me respectfully to offer a few words more
on the proposed alteration of the credit on sugar. Two months'
prompt is not excessive nor too long for practical convenience, and
possesses many advantages which, if given up, must be an injury to the
trade at large. Custom is law. The bar itself is governed by custom. The
market terms belong to the whole trade, and are not the property of
any particular few
to set of men have any right to alter the
usual terms, to the injury e e e
ba e e ye w e t i  ie.
at compen¬
sation. Why should the middle agents
te m onths discount anad
the retailers, who are o e,

teeet
n yone?

the severely-earned money of
tgrocers not be entitled to the full ad¬
vantage of trade discount as in oth e t,
a s t upon what ground
the  s
this month's discount to be taken out of the grocers
pockets? What are a few men io
te tether to con¬
the grocers
to ignore their o  e¬
arket rights and to stultify the just.

which their capital is fairly entitied to?

xtreme, and opposed to all re
on and
good sense. Pardon me, Gentlen.
if I say that no man with a proper
amount of self respect ought to allow himself to be so imposed upon.
Those who expected to get the best men only will find it quite the
reverse.
I am, Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant.

hydropult warehouse, 142 and 143, Cheapside. London. Sir.—I have
great pleasure in recommending your Hydropult, for I fully believe it
was the means of saving my house from being burnt down, during a
private theatrical entertainment given on the night of the 23d ult. The
fire broke out from some unexplained cause, and, from the height of
the flames, no water could be thrown up to it with buckets. Your
Hydropult became therefore mvaluable, and was applied so effectually
that in a quarter of an hour the fire was extinguished. Yours (signed),

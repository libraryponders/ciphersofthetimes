have had a very lengthened experience as AGENTS for the LETTING
of SHOOTINGS ad FISHINGS of every description, and as they
have personally inspected and kepta minute register of some hundreds
of Moors and manj of the Deer Forests throughout Scotland, which
they from time to time have gone over, they are thereby enabled to
furnish sportemen with valuable data of reliable information quite
beyond the power of any other agents in the kingdom, besides enjoy¬
ing the conudence of a large proportion of the sporting nobility and
gentry, which is shown by the fact that out of the total number of
shootings let by agents last yoar at least three-fifths were let by them.
They aiso beg to state that shootings advertised in their List gain the
widest pullicity possible under any circumstances, as several
thousands of these lists are published monthly and sent post free to
the nibility, members of the House of Commons, leading professional
and mercantile gentry, and to some thousands of sportsmentwho have
from time to time hopoured then, with their patronage, and of whom
a careful register has been kept. Their hists are regularly advertised

before the sporting community at large. N.B.—They also undertake
the Sale and Purchase of Estates.

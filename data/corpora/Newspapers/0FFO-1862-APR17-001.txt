84, Shoreditch, London, April 11, 1862.
Gentlemen,—We find, on inquiry of our man who has charge of the
haberdashery, that he ordered of the velvet cutter a lap with a figure
upon it, which, as your note states, is your crest, "a martlett and
lily." We beg to apologize for the liberty taken, which was without
our authority, and in our entire ignorance. We have not the least
hesitation in allowing you to publish our apology for using your trade
mark. None of the goods are remaining in our possession, and it
shall not happen again. JEREMIAH ROTHERAM and Co.
Messrs. Chadwick and Brother, Dyers'-court, Aldermanbury.
Messrs. Chadwick and Brother, 5, Dyers'-court, Aldermanbury.
Gentlemen,—We acknowledge that the crest or mark of a "martlett
and lily" is your exclusive trade mark, and we now deliver over to you
all labels in our possession or power, bearing that mark; and we pro¬
mise and undertake that we will not at any time hereafter make use of
that mark for any purpose whatever without your express knowledge
and consent; and as we have used that mark, we make, for having so
done, this apology, which you are at liberty to publish or make such
other use of as you see advisable. — Dated this 9th day of April, 1862.

LUTCHMEE.—TODAY, at 3 and 8.—This Hindoo
lady's performance is the acme of sensational bewilderment. A
transmission of solid matter being invisibly obtained in full gaslight
reads more like a story from the Arabian Nights, than a 19th century
miracle; but it is really accomplished. The reason of Lutchmee's
success is that nothing approaching her performance has ever been
wituessed by an English audience. By command the medium will
disappear, reappear, and be carried through space, in foll view of the
audience, and in strong gaslight.
QUEENS ROOMS.—LUTCHMEE made her first
appearance on Friday, and caused a furore unprecedented in
the annals of entertainments. Crowded audiences have been declared
her performance to be the acme of thrilling bewilderment, spiritualists
and scientists being alike bewildered.

IN the MATTER of NICOLL v. MAURY, heard

him from making or selling or causing to be made or sold, certain
garments patented by the plaintiff, and commonly known under the
trade mark of RUG PALETOTS, and from making or selling any
colourable imitation thereof, or from using the trade mark so claimed
by the plaintiff.
"London, June 16th, 1870.
"Gentlemen.—I deeply regret having caused you the trouble to de.
fend your patent rights and to institute legal proceedings against me¬
In compliance with the injunction which you have recently obtained,
my solicitors, Messrs. Plews and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed
to pay your costs. 1 have also directed an account to be prepared of
all consignments I have made to the colonies up to the date of the
injunction. These will, as speedily as possible, be furnished to you, as
well as a statement of all rug paletets that have been made by me in
contravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest should be determined by some London or colonial
merchant to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
"I hope that you will do me the justice to believe that, previous to the
commencement of litigation between us. I sincerely thought that your
patent was restricted to the exact configuration described in your speci¬
fication and drawing attached to the patent. I, therefore, did not
imagine that the divergence by me from the design was (as your counse
claimed it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such, I
now understand, consists in the formation of material inte a garment,
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, so that
the same garment may alternately be worn as a railway rug and as a
cloak. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the knowledg,
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of damages, 1 have no
objection to your publishing this letter.

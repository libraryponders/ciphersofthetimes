JE N'OUBLIERAI JAMAIS.—J.
MINNIE M— Many, many THANKS for what
I received Wednesday. Let me know directly you return, and if
you will be absent long, do write to me sometimes. Trust me.
CROSS.—Thousand
thanks for letter. Awfully
pleased and delighted to get it. Don't like the idea of the trip to
L. on Tuesday at all. Hope it won't be as un. T. as the last time, when
you were unkind. Wish you to stop quiet where you are, and rest from
your labours. Is the surveillance very strict? Is P. O. under old
man's thumb and dangerous? Im not sure of being there on 26th.
I think "Trees" might be managed; it would be a great comfort.
Don't give up in case of going to L. be firm and write. Yours till
death, MAGPIE.

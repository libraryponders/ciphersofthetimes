of Sewing Machines.—Legal proceedings have been threatened in
Chancery against myself and many of my friends by Mr. Foxwell, of

a needle and shuttle, and which he designates as an infringement of

mode of defending any proceedings that may be adopted in respect
thereof. I have considered that it will be expedient to call a MEET¬

the Meeting.	ROBERT BATEMAN, Shoe Manufacturer,

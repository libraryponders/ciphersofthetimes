monial: "Admiralty, Somerset-house, 3d Nov., 1863.—Gentlemen,—
Although I have not had the opportunity of fully testing the £5 tele¬
scope I bought of you in June, 1 can say that it is far superior to any
glass of the same price which I have yet met with. I used it for a
fortnight while practising at a rifle range on the sea-beach, and found
that if I had chosen to do so I could have dispensed with the services
of a marker. Nothing is more disturbing than the mirage arising from
the action of a midsummer sun on wet sands; still I found that I
could detect the shot on the target before the marker's fiag could signal
it, and that the gas is a perfect check upon the marking beyond the
range of the Enfield rifle. Wishing to test the power of your tele¬
scope, I went on one occasion at the end of my morning's practice to
the head of the pier, 2 miles distant as the crow flies, and counted the
bulls'-eyes on a second class target, and this was on a day when there
was so much mist that a well known seamark at a distance of seven
miles was invisible. At other times the glass afforded me much amuse¬
ment; looking from my window, I could recoguize those who were far
off in rowing or sailing boats, and my scan of the horizon would often
reveal a sail totally invisible to the naked eye. In conclusion, I have
only to observe that, in my opinion, of all the telescopes exhibited this
year at the Wimbledon meeting of the National Rifle Association, there
was not one to be compared to yours for great power with great cheap¬
ness.—Your obedient servant, SAML. S. LEWES.

Kensington-park, and the public generally, that the unauthorized
printing and the circulation last Sunday morning the 1st of March,
within that church of the words of the introit, "O send out thy light
and truth, &c.," without his concurrence, was an infringement of his
copyright. Dr. G. also desires to state that the music of this introit,
as also of the Nicene Creed, the Sanctus, and Gloria in Excelsis, sung
for the last 18 months by the priests, quire, and congregation in this

announcement is considered necessary in order to protect such copy¬
right. Dr. G. still continues to give instruction to the clergy and
students in music, and all those who desire to improve their know¬
ledge of the true laws governing the sounds in music, their ratios, and
the order of their position.—23, Colville-road, Kensington-park.

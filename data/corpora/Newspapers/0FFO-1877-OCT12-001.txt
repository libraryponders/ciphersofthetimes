THE PATENT NECROPOLIS EARTH-IO-EARTH
COFFINS. This Coffin or Casket, while not repulsive in appear¬
ance, like ordinary coffihs, is peculiarly suited to the process of natural
interment, facilitating the free resolvent action of the carth upon
human remains. Its construction is simple as it is salutary. Possessing
the apparent strength, solidity, and other qualities of a solid coffin, it
yet differs in this important respect, namely : that while the latter
interferes with the natural dissolution of the body, the former promotes
its disintegration and absorption, thus effectually carrying out the
sanitary principle of Earth-to-Earth burial.
To Mr. Seymour Haden is due the full credit of having exposed the
fearful evils arising from the practice of burying the dead in wooden
or other imperishable coffins. In his series of able letters to Tue
Times, he points out that at present "the dead are little more than
nominally buried, and that the interposition between them and the
carth that should resolve them of such media as wood, led, brick, and
the like, interment as a principle is rendered all but nugatory and as
a practice deprived of its raison d'stre," and, moreover." has led us to
accumulate in our midst a vast store of human remaing in every stage
and condition of decay," a state of things revoiting in the extreme, and

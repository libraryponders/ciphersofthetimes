FREE TRAD'S in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to obe
tam perfect PREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 12, to 20 per cent. upon articles of daily use, and by the
still more obrectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that ne other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, an
proved by the annual duminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern nscal legisiation () contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths work. The tax has been condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political cconomists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

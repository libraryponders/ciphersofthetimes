DRAWN, and in doing so, Mr. Pollaky begs to state, in deference to
the great interest evinced by a number of persons, that this long-mis¬

he was living for two years in strict retirement in London, unknown,
but kindly treated by the different English families with whom he was
staying; and whom Mr. Pollaky begs sincerely to thank for the readi¬

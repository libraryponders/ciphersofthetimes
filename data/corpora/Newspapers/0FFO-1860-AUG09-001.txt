the patent in conformity with the views of the minority of the Judges

but should appeal to the House of Lords. If Mr. Betts should suc¬
ceed in his appeal to the House of Lords, all persons who may in the
mean time, and pending his appeal, have infringed his patent, by
making, using, or selling articles, made according to the specification
of his patent, will be liable to a suit in Chancery for an account of the
profits he may have made, and for an injunction to restrain any fur¬
ther infringement of the patent.

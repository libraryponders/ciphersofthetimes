CAUTION.—In the matter of Field's Paraffine

ably reported upon by scientific men of high repute, and has also been
noticed with approval in many of the public journals, and Messrs.
J. C. and J. Field are now commonly considered the manufacturers of
paraffine candles; and whereas candles of inferior paraffine, and
candles composed in part only of paraffine, are being intreduced into

factured by Messrs. Field according to the process reported on by Dr.

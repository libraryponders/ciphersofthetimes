Q.—There is an error in the message. Read

ORD.—Circumstances much miscalculated, for ap
proach not yet practicable, howsoever fervently desired. Ad¬
vancing well; meanwhile everything recognised is joy, though, again,
let not incautious ardour jeopardise all. Incidental information most
comforting, if understood aright and reconcilable with past fears.—63.

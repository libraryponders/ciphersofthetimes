MENTS, and particularly with regard to the dual garment called
the Rug Paletot. Unprincipled persons, who have only suddenly
awakened to the advantage of this invention through the advertise¬
ments connected therewith, are already trying to pass off clumsy
imitations for that which D. Nicoll and Co. have already rroved
to be the cheapest article ever offered to the public. The safeguard
will be the right to demand to see the trade mark, which may be thus
described: the Coats of Arms of London and Paris are printed or
woven on to a loop used for hanging up the garment, and between
these emblems of the two cities, the words "Nicoll's l'stent

counterfciters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy
the labels as frequently to deceive the unwary; some offer to dispose
of the recipe of a Macassar oil, with other recipes of a similar cha¬
racter, for a few postage stamps; while others profess to manufacture
the real ( article at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
nly purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
"Lecion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make their selection of articles for the toilet."

STRANGE OCCURRENCE.—On Monday morning
last, at an early hour, a gentleman deposited a watch with a young
assistant at Mr. Chappuis' establishment, 69, Fleet-street, and took
away 12 album photos of Sandringham, stating he would call at his
bankers and return and pay. He made use of very incoherent language
which w
induce the belief that he is of unsound mind. If his friends
will apply and give a correct description of the watch and names en¬
graved on the inner case, also bring back or pay
photos and the

cost of advertisement, Mr. Chappuis will return the property.—4th

Featherston, Esq., Superintendent of the Province of Wellington, in
the Islands of New Zealand.—Whereas, by Section Number X. of the
Diseased Cattle Act, 1861," it was enacted that if at any time it
should be made to appear to the Governor that any infectious or con¬
tagious disease has broken out amongst cattle in any district of the
colony, it should be lawful for the Governor by Order in Council to de¬
clare that such district was infected within the meaning of the Act,
and from time to time to make such regulations for destroying dis¬
eased cattle therein, and for prohibiting the removal or transportation
of cattle from one part of the colony to another, and for preventing the
further spread of such disease as to him should seem fit; and it was
by the same Act also enacted that the Governor in Council might, by
warrant under his hand, from time to time delegate to the Superin¬
tendent of any province within the colony all or any of the powers
vested in the Governor, or Governor in Council, by the said Act, sub¬
ject to such regulations as he might think fit, and might from time to
time rescind such delegation; and whereas the Governor hath, with
the advice and consent of the Executive Council of New Zealand, de¬
legated to Isaac Earl Featherston, Esq., as long as he shall
hold the office of Superintendent of the Province  of Wellington,
the several powers vested in the Governor by the second, fourth, fiith,
seventh, ninth and tenth sections of the said Act, subject to
being rescinded, as in the said Act was provided, and subject to
the regulations issued by the Governor in Council on the 1st day of
October, 1861, and to any other regulations to be from time to time
duly made; and whereas by proclamation, issued on or about the 14th
day of October, 1863, certain places were declared infected districts
within the meaning and for the purposes of the said Act;—Now, there¬
fore, I. the said Isaac Earl Featherston, by virtue of the powers vested
in me in this behaif, do hereby proclaim and declare that after the
date hereof the provinces of Auckland, Hawke's Bay, and Taranaki,
Canterbury, Nelson, and Marlborough, shall also be deemed infected
districts within the meaning and for the purposes of the above men¬
tioned Act, and that no cattle, after the date hereof, until further
notice, shall be imported into the province of Wellington from such
districts. Given under my hand, and issued under the public seal
of the province of Wellington, at Wellington, this 17th day of February,

RESTORATION of ALIENATED TITHES.—
A public MEETING will be hold on the 20th Anniversary of the
Tithe Redemption Trust, Friday, 11th of May, 3 p.m., at Willis's
Rooms, St. James's.
Chief Patron—The Archbishop of CANTERBURY.
Chairman—Lord JOHN MANNERS, M.P.
Trustees.
Lord Ebury
Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone, M.P.
Lord J. Manners. M.P.
Sir W. P. Wood, Vice-Chancellor.
Honorary Secretary—W. W. Malet, Rector of Ardeley, Herts.
Bankers—Messrs. Hoare, Fleet-street.
Office—7. Whitehall, S.W.
Since the commencement of this work Alienated Tithes amounting to
more than £26,000 per annum have been restored to the parishes wher
they are produced. But about £1,600,000 per annum are still alienated.
All impropriate tithes held by ecclesiastics are falling to the Com¬
missioners, who will, it is hoped, restore them to their proper places;
the rest are held by colleges, hospitals, ladies, noblemen, and gentle¬
men, who are generally willing to restore them at a sacrifice, or at a
fair valuation, for the benefit of the people by whose industry and
labour they are produced.
Those who pay tithes to impropriators are called on to assist the
Church and the poor in various ways for want of these very tithes.
The clergy and their flocks, especially the working classes, in thou¬
sands of parishes suffer severely through tithes collected among them
being spent far away.
In England and Wales, 2,000 benefices have less than £100 a year, and
2,600 less than £200 a year, owing to this alienation.
The Tithe Redemption Trust, striving to remedy this great national
evil by helping the parishioners and others interested to buy back these
tithes, is worthy of general support; and if all adult members of the
Church would subscribe from 1s. upwards annually the work would
soon be accomplished.

CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—

works of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs
cannot be obtained by this method, there being always a great differ¬
ence between a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to
secure, at any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them
in perfect order from first to last (about 16,000 in number); and from
these plates, and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining
proofs, either of the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.

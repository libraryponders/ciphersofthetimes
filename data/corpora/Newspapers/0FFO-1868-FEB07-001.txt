Midland Railway, Derby Station, Feb. 1, 1868.
Sir.—I am requested to state a Committee of Shareholders and Mid¬
land Directors had a Meeting this afternoon, when a resolution was
passed to abandon the Settle and Carliale Line, the London and North¬
Western Board having made very reasonable offers for the working of
the Scotch traflic over the Lancaster and Carlisle Line. A second re¬
solution was passed to postpone several other projects for five years;
this will reduce the amount of new capital required to very narrow
limits. Further, the auditors have nearly completed our accounts,
which indicate a dividend at the rate of £6 10s. per cent. per

FETTES COLLEGE.—Head Master.—The Trustees
of the Fettes College, now in course of erection at Comely Bank,
in the immediate neighbourhood of Edinburgh, desire to hear of a
gentleman who will undertake the duties of HEAD MASTER.
As it is intended that the College should be conducted on a system
similar in its general principles to that of the Public Schools of Eng¬
land, it is desirable that, besides being otherwise qualified, the head
master should have had practical experience of that system.
The fixed salary will be £1,000 a-year, with an unfurnished house
forming part of the College buildings; but a considerable increase
may be anticipated, dependent in amount on the number of pupils at¬
tending the College.
It is expected that the College will be opened in the autumn of
1870 ; but a proportion of the salary will be paid to the head master
from the date of his appointment, in order that, in so far as may be
compatible with his other engagements, the Trustees may have the
benefit of his advice and assistance in the selection of under masters,
and in completing the organization of the College.
Further particulars may be obtained from Frederick Pitman, Esq.,
W.S., Clerk to the Trustees, 45, Castle-street, Edinburgh, to whom
applications, with relative testimonials, may be addressed, between
this day and the 1st of May next.

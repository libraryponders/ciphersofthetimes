THE BRITISH LION.—It is proposed by a number
of friends of TOM SAYERS, who has so nobly vindicated Eaglish
fortitude in the recent contest with the equally gallant "Benicia Bay,"
that the subscription already commenced by the Houses of Lords and
Commons, the gentlemen of the Stock Exchangs, the commercial
rooms, and the merchants of the city of London, should be augmented
by a general TESTIMONIAL from the country at large ; to that end
a committee is now formed, and they will be glad of the co-operation
of all who value national honour and bravery. It is most desirable
that branches should be formed in the provinces immediately, and
parties desirous of assisting the movement are requested to communi¬
cate their views by letter, addressed to the Editor of Bell's Life in

BAREY.—Mr. J. S. RAREY has the honour to an¬

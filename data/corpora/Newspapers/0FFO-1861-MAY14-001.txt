GREAT DOVER-ROAD TOLL-GATE.—At a
numerously-attended MEETING, held at the Duchess of Kent,

THOMAS WINTERBOTHAM, Esq., in the Chair;
It was resolved unanimously, That the tolis taken on the Great Dover¬
road have for many years caused great injury to the property and trade
of the neighbourhood, by diverting the traffic therefrom, while the
parish is burdened with the repair of the road on which the tolls are
taken. That the Bill now before the House of Commons for a second
renewal of the tolls is contrary to the provisions of the act under which
the first renewal was obtained, and would perpetuate the injury and
injustice complained of. This Meeting resolves, therefore, to petition
Parliament against the Bill.
That a committee be formed for the purpose of conferring with the
Members of Parliament for the boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark,
and requesting their assistance in defeating the Bill; and that such
committee be requested to bring to the notice of such members the
facts of the case as stated in the petition, and, in addition thereto, that
the renewal of the original Act in 1830 was obtained without the know¬
ledge of the inhabitants.
That the thanks of the Meeting be given to Thomas Winterbotham,
Esq., for his able conduct in the chair.

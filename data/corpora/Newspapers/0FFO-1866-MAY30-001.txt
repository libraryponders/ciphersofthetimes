TAKE NOTICE. —Whereas, Samuel Cooper, a
native, it is believed, of the county of Derby, many years ago
entered the service of Robert Doughty, of Hanworth-hall, in the county
of Norfolk, Esquire, and subsequently to his death continued in the
service of Phillp W. Mayow, Esquire, who succeeded Robert Doughty
Samuel Cooper, while living in the service of Mr. Mayow, married
Elizabeth Wild, a fellow servant. Subsequently, Samuel Cooper
occupied a small farm in Hanworth, which he relinquished, and after¬
wards hired a farm in North Walsham, called the Muckle-hill Farm.
He occupied this farm for a short period, and, on quitting it, entered
the service of Jedidiah Barcham, of North Walsham, with whom, and
with whose widow he lived some time. He retired from service and
died at North Walsham in the year 1861, aged 86, in very indigent cir¬
cumstances. His wife, Elizabeth Cooper, died in or about the year
1850. The next of kin or other personal representative of the said
Samuel Cooper appear to be entitled to a small sum of money, arising
from the sale of an estate in the county of Norfolk, late the property
of Thomas Wild, a deceased brother of Elizabeth Cooper. If any
person or persons claim to be the NEXT of KIN, or to be the personal

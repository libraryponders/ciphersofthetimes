of Chancery for an INJUNCTION to restrain Mrar Rosetta Myers

Keen from using any name inscription or device calculated to mis¬
lead the public into the belioef that her shop (at the corner of Mary¬
lebone-lane) is "Caves" or one concarn therewith. They were driven
to apply to the Court by the fact of several intending customers
having been misled. By a decree dated 18th January 1872 the Court
doth order that a perpetual injuaetion be awarded to restrain the
defendants Rosetta Myers and Henry Keen from representing
that the shop No. 68 Wigmore-street in the plaintiff's Bill of

dish House" and from exhibiting the words Cavendish House
on any part of the said shop and from using trade memorandums
or other documents referring to the said shop by the three num¬
bers 68 69 and 70 Wigmore-street or by any other number than
the proper No. 63 and from using catalogues or advertisements or
other documents containing the words "Specially desgned for Her
Royal Highness the Princess of Wales" or "Designed for Her Royal
Highness the Princess of Wales" in reference to any goods sold in the
said shop and from making any representation and from using any
name inscription or device calculated or likely to mislead the pubhic
into the belief that the said shop is the plaintiffs establishments or one
concern therewith or calculated or likely to secure for the defendants
or either of them custom intended for the plaintiffs in their business.
And it is ordered that the said defendants Rosetta Myers and Henry
Keen do pay to the plaintiffs their costs of and incidental to this suit,
H. J. C. and 8s, have three houses adloining and their name is conspi¬
cuous on all. Intending purchasers are warned to be careful that they

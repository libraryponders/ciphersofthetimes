—Justus Von Liebig.
"I am of opinion that Phospho-Guano is a uniformly prepared,
highlyiconcentrated, and more generally useful manure than the bigher¬

Composed of guano imported from islands at the equator in the
Pacific Ocean, richer in phosphoric acid than any other known guane.
The ammonia is in a pure and ready formed state, immediately avail¬
able for assimilation by plants.
This Guano gives to crops a greater chance in unfavourable seasons,
and in proof of its powerful fertilising qualities, has invariably pro¬
duced a greater maximum weight of produce in bulk as well as in
specific gravity.
Though so entirely soluble, it is in an easy dry condition for spread¬
ing on the land, and being highly concentrated, much money and
labour are saved in carriage and handling.
The application of Phospho-Guano restores to the soil in the
cheapest form the weight of fertilising properties extracted by the

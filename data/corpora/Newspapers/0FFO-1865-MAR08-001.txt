IN the Matter of LETTERS PATENT granted to
HENRY MEDLOCK, of Great Marlborough-street, in the county

in the preparation of red and purple dyes," bearing date the 18th day
of January, 1860 (No. 126).—Notice is hereby given that George Simpson,
George Maule, and Edward Chambers Nicholson, all of the Atlas
Works, Locks-fields, Walworth, in the county of Surrey, manufacturing
chymists and co-partners, as assignees of the said letters patent, have
APPLIED by petition to Her Majesty's Commissioners of Patents
for Inventions for leave to ENTER  DISCLAIMER of a certain part
of the SPECIFICATION to the said LETTERS PATENT: and any
person intending to oppose such application must leave notice thereof
at the office of Her Majesty's Solicitor General, No. 1, Mitre-court¬

MARRIAGE FEES in BETHNAL-GREEN.—
We, the undersigned, have been advised that a clergyman has
no legal right to sell the fees of his benefice. The Rev. E. Coke, In¬
cumbent of St. James's Church, Bethual-green, proposes that if the
benevolent public will give him £100 a year he will resign his claim to
marriage fees, although such fees cannot amount to more than £40 a
year. The poor in Bethnal-green are as able and willing to pay their
marriage fees (8s., including banns) as the poor in any other part of
London, and the amounts of such fees were equitably settled some
time since by the late Bishop. In any case of inability to pay, the resi¬
dent incumbents of the parish have ever been willing to sacrifice their
fees. The undersigned are sure that they only reflect the opinion of
the parish at large when they say that Mr. Coke, probably from igno¬
rance, naturally arising from his home being at Tottenham, and not in
Bethnal-green, has, unintentionally perhaps, but most certainly libelled
both the inhabitants and the clergy of the parish by his proposed
scheme, the practical effect of which is to increase the income of his
living. Should Mr. Coke succeed in raising the proposed fund, he
would not be legally bound to dispense with marriage fees, and there
certainly would be no obligation, either moral or legal, on his succes¬
sor to do so.

HYDROPULT.—Caution.—Devices in imitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are calculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. The
proprietor therefore issues this caution, and respectfully intimates that
parties wishing to purchase the hydropult should examine the machine
offered for sale, and see if it has attached thereto a label, with the fol¬
lowing words:—"The Hydropult, Vose's P'atent, manufactured only
by Gritliths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles Pomeroy Button,
proprietor 142 and 143, Cheapside, London." Unless this label is
attached the machine is not the hydropult. Hydropults weigh but Sib.,
and will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. Hydropults will draw
water horizontally, if necessary, through 310 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. Hydro¬
puits can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or foreepump is
applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances are useless.
Hydropults have been recommended as an efficient and useful fire¬
engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of Great
Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department as
dire-engines. Robert Hogg. LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibbard, Esq.,
F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other well¬
known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable garden
implement. Hydropults have been recommended by the Gardeners'
Chronicle, Journal of Horticuiture, Gardeners' Magazine, Daily Tele¬
graph, Liverpool Daily Post, Commercial Daily List, Illustrated News
of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Magazine, City Press,
Insurance Gazette, and other first class journals throughout Great
Britain. An illustrated prospectus, with testimonials, free on applica¬

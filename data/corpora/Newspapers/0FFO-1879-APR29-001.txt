EXTRACT from London MORNING POST of the
26th April, 1879 :—"On the 14th of March Mr. Bourke, in the
House of Commons, made statements reflecting on Messrs. Hutton.
of Manchester and Liverpoal, for having supplied arms to South
Africa. On the next evening, however, the Under Secretary for
Foreign Affairs not only entirely exonerated Mr. James Hutton, of
Mancnester, who had only shipped cotton goods, but he also explained
that Messrs. Hutton, of Liverpool, were free from the accusation of
supplying arms to the Zulus, inasmuch as that firm had only executed
an order received last November for the shipment of fiint guns and
cheap powder to Mozambique, a thousand miles from Zululand and a
four months voyage from England. Mr. Grantley Berkeley, on read¬
ing Mr. Bourke's arst statement, wrote to us on the 15th March a
short letter, expressive of the resentment of Englishmen at the alleged
misconduct of an English firm. This letter ought, of course, not to
have been published after Mr. Bourke's explanation, but, owing to a
most unfortunate inadvertence, it actually appeared in our columns
118th of March. We regret the accident, and tender to Messrs.
HUTTON our sincere APOLOGIES.

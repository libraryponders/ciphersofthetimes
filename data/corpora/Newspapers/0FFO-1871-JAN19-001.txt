their trade mark, E. and Co., under a crown, in a shield—the represen¬
tation now so frequently made, that articles, often of the most inferior
description, are plated by Elkington and Co.'s process, is entirely value
less as a criterion of quality. In the case of "Elkington v. Johnson,"
recently tried before Vice-Chancellor James, defendant having unlaw¬
fully used their marks, a perpetual injunction was granted restraining
defendant from using or imitating their name or trade marks; and
Elkington and Co. give notice that they will take LEGAL PROCEED¬

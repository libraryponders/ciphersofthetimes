NYSTERIOUS MURDER. —Whereas, on or about
the 22d of March last, the body of a female was discovered
under a heap of stones, in a declivity of the Rheinecker Berges, between
Broll and Niederbreisig-on-the-Rhein, together with various articies
of dress, fully described in The Times of the 9th inst.; and, whereas.
from further information received it appears that the person in said
advertisement stated to be so killed by a gunshot traversing the breast,
lungs, and back, was a stranger and a traveller. The remains of the
clothing being that of a nightdress, leads the authorities to the suppo¬
sition that the person was murdered in her bed, and afterwards removed
to the locality mentioned. Initials on the linen, of the German printed
alphabet.—"M. R., 6," and in Gothic, "A. H., 36." The relatives of
any female missing in this country about the period named, and who
has not since been heard of, will send information to C. F. Field,
late Chief of the Metropolitan Detective Police ; or to De Rodenberg,
the King's Procurator-General in Coblentz.—J. Pollaky, Superintendent
of the foreign department, Private Inquiry-office, 20. Devereux-court,

EYE of the person who advertised some time since relative to the
absence of two Protestant young ladies, let him or her immediately
COMMUNICATE—the initials "A. H." corresponding.

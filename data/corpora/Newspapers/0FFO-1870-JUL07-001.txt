"Gentlemen.—I desply regret having caused you the trouble to de.
fend your patent rights and to institute legal proceedings against me¬
In complignce with the injunction which you have recently obtained,
my soliciters, Messrs. Plews and Irvine, of 33, Mark-lane, are instructed
to pay your costs. I have also directed an account to be prepared of
all consiguments I have made to the colonies up to the date of the
injunotion. These will, as speedily as possible, be furnished to you, as
well as a statement of all rug paictots that have been made by me in
sontravention of your patent. Whatever dispute may arise in future
dealings, I suggest should be determined by ebme Lonson or colonial
merchant to whom we may mutually agree to refer the question
I hope that you will do me the justice to believe thatrprevious to the
commencement of litigation between us, 1 sincerely thought that yefir
patent was restricted to the exect sonfiguration described in your speci¬
fication and drawing attached to the patent. I, therefore, did not
inagginet
the divergence by me from the design
stet e o c e e 
claimed it to be) an infringement of the original principle. Such, I
now understan d, co ie
in the formation of material into a garment
and in the manner set forth, with an adaptation for its use, so that
the same gare e
worn as a railway rng and as a
erately
clonk. As other shippers may, like me, have erred in the knowledge
of what your claim really consists, and out of the consideration which
you have shown towards me on the question of damages, 1 have no
objection to your publishing this letter.

AMEETING of the CLERGY of the diocese of

and the Prince of WALES on His Royal Highness's Marriage, will be
held at London-house, THIS DAY, at 5 o'oclock.
INCOME-TAX.—CHARITIES.—The Bill renewing
the Act for Income-tax is printed, and if it passes in its present
shape it will deprive all hospitals, almshouses, asylums, and other
charities of the exemption hitherto granted to them in respect of their
rents and dividends.
Such exemption rests on good grounds.
To tax income dedicated to the relief of the poor is to tax the most
needy part of the community.
It is a fallacy to speak of taxing the property producing such income,
or the trustees who administer it; the tax is on those beneficially en¬
titled to the income.
Why are the poor thus to be taxed while persons having incomes of
less than £100 are to be exempted?
Why are funds applicable to the repair of churches and chapels, and
belonging to friendly societies, to be exempted, as proposed by the Bill,
while funds dedicated to the relief of the sick, the widow, and the
orphan are to be taxed?
A determined resistance against this unjust and impolitic attempt to
tax the poor will be made; and if the trustees of charities throughout
the country will send up petitions, with proper representations, to their
members, showing what will be the effect of the measure upon the
objects of their institutions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be
compelled to abandon this comparatively unimportant part of his

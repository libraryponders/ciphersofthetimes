LONDON SCHCOL BOARD.—To the ELECTORS of the TOWER
HAMLETS
Gentlemen.
Beg to offer myself as one of vour Representatives on
the School Board of London.,
The importance of the task set before it must make anyons diffident
of undertaking such a responsibility, but, if elected, my best energies
will be devoted to the work.
I am not witheut experience of the educational needs of the East of
London, nor of the efforts that have been made in the past to supply

I believe that it is possible to give religious teaching, founded upon
the broad Christian principles of the Bible which, at the same time,
shall not favour one sect above another. This is proved by practical
experience in the British schools, and it is in the main their syatem
which I hope to sue adopted in all the newly-created schools.
It will be impossible for the Central Board to attend to the details
of management of all the schools in London, and I hope that the
managers of existing schools will still retain a large share of the con¬
trol to which their experience entitles them.
I am a Churchman, but I do not ask for your votes on that ground,
as 1 expect that on the religious question there will be no radical dif¬
ference of opinion between members of the Board who are Churchmen
and those who belong to other Christian denominations.
I believe that direct compulsion may be safely adopted in London
and other large towns. If I am elected I shall esteem it the greatest
honour to belong to the foremost Education Board of the country, and
one which will probably serve as a model for all others.
I am, your fuithful servant
EDWARD NORTH BUXTON.

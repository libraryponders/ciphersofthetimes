MARVESTING, 1877.—The Duke of Sutherland and
Mr. Carey (of Pylle), having arranged with the Patentee to con¬
struct the NEW HARVESTERS, at their respective estates, and by
sheir own engineers (paying a royalty of 10 per cent, on the cost), Mr.
GIBBS offers the same arrangement to the other noblemen and gentle¬
men who were present last season at the trials, and who have since had
the testimony of scientific men and practical farmers as to the results
obtainable. This offer only holds good for the present season, after
which licenses will be grantel to implement makers, who will have to
add their own profits to the royalties, involving, a much higher range
of charge for the machines (present cost £50 to £350, according to the
size of farm). With tenant-farmers Mr. Gibbs will postpone all charge
for royalty until the machine has saved them the full amount of such
royalty. As to the performance of the earlier and simpler forms of
hay-dryers, Mr. Ainsworth, of Smithell's-hall, Bolton, wrote:—
have saved a Dutch barnful of hay during rain, and without any roof
over the machine." Mr. Amersfoordt, of Haarlem, invited a
gathering of 4,000 of the chief people in Holland to see his in
action, and afterwards wrote :—"Grass that had been cut a couple
of days was made into hay in five minutes, and was then immediately
stacked with perfect safety. The horses eat it eagerly. I consider
the trial perfectly successful." The Hon. Mrs. Maberly wrote tor
"The hay-dryer answers perfectly. We brought in the wettest grass I
ever saw, and made it into excellent rowon. My cows are now boing
fed with it. As to the new labour-saving hay-dryer, Sir G. W. Broko
Middleton, Bart., wrote:—"I have the pleasure to inform you that
about two hours sufficed to fit the hay-dryer for traveling on the
road, and in less than a day it was adjusted to my engine. We dried
a large two-horse waggon-load of coarse half-made, low meadow hay
in an hour and a half. I am quite satisfied as to the capabilities of
the machine." Mr. John Ashcombe and Mr. Peter Mills, of Neward¬
stone, say:—"We were present when you dried 174 load of truss¬
bound hay in three-quarters of an hour, such hay having been pre¬
viously proved to contain 33 per cent. of excess water." Mr. Boddick,
of Quintain-hill, Waltham Abbey, says:—"Nineteen loads of damaged
hay, which would otherwise have been useless, were rendered fit for
stacking at the rate of 240 loads per hour. I realized £60 to £70 by
the day and a half's use of the hay-dryer." Mr. Mills says:— "Heavy,
wet hay, black with decay and dust, came out a good fair colour; the
horses ate it freely. I estimate it as worth £5 a load in market, and
have saved £20 by the half-day's work." The Editors of the Agricul¬
tural Gazette and the Chamber of Agriculture Journal say:—"We
are able to report that during the severe and long protracted trials
with grass and hay in all conditions, thore was no strain or fallure
in any part of the mechanism." With regard to coffce drying,
Messrs. Armitage, of Ceylon, wrote :—"Please ship castings and
sparing for another cylinder." As to rice. Messrs. Gray, Lockle, and
Co., of St. Dunstan's-buildings, write:—"Your drying crlinder is a
great success. As to tea, Mr. J. B. Barry, 110, Caunon-street, has
sent out two cylinders and taken letters-patent for India. As to
drying cotton-waste and other similar products, Mr. Gibbs' process
has been in successful use for many years at Her Majesty's Govern¬
ment Works at Waltham Abbey. As to megass, Mr. J. B. Alkin,
Member of the Legislature, Natal, wrote; "The success you have at¬
ee
cause your name to be remembered as a benefactor to the colony. I
have to-day sent to our agents to procure your megass-dryer as soon
as possible. Recont experiments have shown that where a large

camps) the straw from the stables can be dried so as to effect a saving

to omnibus companies, jobmasters, and cariers, whereby they can

prove the value of the process. These machines and specimens of the

Early inspection is requested, as this last arrangement can only be
made for a few weeks.
All who are interested in the above facts should cut out and retain

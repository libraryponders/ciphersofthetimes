TWENTYSECOND ASCENT over the Fountains THIS DAY,
September 12, at 5 o'clock precisely. To exhibit his wondrous and daring
feats, three enormous masts have been erected on the terrace, over
which has been strained the rope made expressly for this purpose, above
2,000 ft. in length. It has recently been raised many feet higher in the
centre, and approaches more nearly a straight line than any rope of
equal length ever before stretched. M. Blondin will perform some
of his most astounding feats on this occasion, and repeat his truly
marvellous chair feats sitting on the chair in various positions, and
standing on the seat and back while balanced on the rope at the
height of 160 feet from the ground. The fountains will be played
during the performance. The slopes and terraces at the Crystal
Palace afford ample accommodation for any possible number of visi¬
tors ; but, to provide for the accommodation of those who prefer it, a
few reserved seats are set apart in the Queen's box corridor (from which
M. Blondin takes his departure) at 5s. each; or on the other open corridors
at 2s. 6d. each. The Band of the Coldstream Guards will attend (by
the permission of Colonel Percival) and perform on the terrace during
Blondin's exhibition. Frequent trains will runfrom London-bridge, Vic¬
toria, and intermediatestations; but, as M. Blondin's performances take
place exactly at the times announced, visitors by railway, to prevent
disappointment and crowding, will do well to avall themselves of trains
somewhat early in the day. The doors of the Palace will be opened
at 10. Admission (including all the attractions of the Palace without
extra charge), 1s.; children and schools half-price.

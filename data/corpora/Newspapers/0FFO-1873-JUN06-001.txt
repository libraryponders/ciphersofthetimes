with this notice in the London Gazette and the Army List, and is also

Applications from persons supposing themselves entitled as next
of kin should be addressed by letter to the Under Secretary of State,

No application can be attended to which does not state the date and

Should these particulars furnished by the applicant not agree with

therewith, then, within three calendar months, the Secretary of State
will furnish the applicant with the usual requirements needed for the

The application must be authenticated by the signature of the
applicant, and his name should be affixed in the presence of the

the Peace ; the applicant's address, with the name of the post town,
must also be clearly stated. No personal application can receive at¬
tention.
Further lists will from time to time be published, and therefore it

the notice in which the deceased soldier's name appeared.

POLOGIES of the FREEMAN'S JOURNAL
and EVENING TELEGRAPH to the SHIP CARPENTERS
of BELFAST.— Our readers are aware that we fell into the error of
believing that the ship carpenters of the Queen's Island took part in
the Belfast riots of August last. For this there was no foundation
whatever; and in consequence that body felt aggrieved at the unwar¬
rantable words applied to them in the comments made by us at the
time. Careful local inquiry has satisfied us that not one single member
of the ship carpenters body was in any way connected with those rints,
and therefore it is our duty, and justice to the members of that bony
requires us, to withdraw unconditionally the observations we made,
and which we do; and in addition tender to them our frank
APOLOGY for the error into which we fell and for the language used.
We feel it right to add that we have been met by the ship carpenters
in this matter, and by Mr. Charles H. Ward, their law adviser, in a
manner that proved that ample vindication of character was their
only object.

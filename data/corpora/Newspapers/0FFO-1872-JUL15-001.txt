to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
"Wotherspoon y. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indisputably esta

starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of if
to a penaity of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
been induced so buy it, that to save them from total loss we wil
allow 20s. per cwt. for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This wil
entail a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up and sole
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the article useless for further deception. Any information that will
rlead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.

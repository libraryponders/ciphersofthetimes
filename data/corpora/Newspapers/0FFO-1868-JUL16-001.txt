imitations of their refrigeraters of an inferior quality, got un and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fce Com¬

CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE¬
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the
blockice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any otherice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZING
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 3156, Oxford-street, London.

stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their invoice.—

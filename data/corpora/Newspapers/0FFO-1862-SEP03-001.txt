—Mr. POLLAKY, who during the last 12 years has been en¬
trusted with the most delicate and confidential inquiries in this country
and abroad, has established this Burcan de Renseignement with a view
of protecting the interest of the British public in the social, legel, and
commercial relations with foreigners, of whose attecedents and charae¬
ter he will furnish prompt and authentic information—particularly
desirable in case of matrimonial allance. Parents and guardiang
ought specially to avail themselves of this agency on behalf of their
wards, whose future happiness and comfort they ought to ensure by
thus carly informing themselves of the character and standing of the
foreigner, who not seldom introduces himself under a fictitious name
and title possessed of no means of existence and aiming only at possess.
ing himself of the property of the wife he intends to desert. The
annual subscription for bankers and city firms (1o guineas) should be
paid only at the offices, 14, George-street, Mansion-house, E.C.

CAUTION to PURCHASERS of REVOLVERS.
—Various advertissments of revolvers, professed by the adver¬
tisers to be improvements on Deane and Adams' revolver, are appear¬
ing. The so-called improvements are simply attempts to evade the
patents of Mr. Adams, the inventor and patentee of the revolver,
sometimes known as Deane and Adams', but most generally as Adams'
revolver. The original revolver was invented and patented by Mr.
Adams while he was a partner in the fism of Deane, Adams, and
Deane. Since he dissolved partnership he has, by recent patented
improvements on the iginal pistol, made it the most perfect and
reliable weapon before ane public, and the only one adopted by H.M.

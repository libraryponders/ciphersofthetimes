nal natives of the colony, and which has not been disallowed, is
drawn to the provisions of the said ACT next following, that is to

Act. 1858" (hereinafter called "the said Acts'), which shall not be

Whenever any selection of land is required to be made under the

within which such selection shall be made, and if the selection be not
made within auch period, such rignt of selection shall lapse and be
deemed abandoned, and the claimant or claimants shall have no fur¬
ther right, title, or interest in respect of such claim, or in respect of
any land the subject of such claim.
In any claim in which difficultes exist in the way of obtaining quiet
possession of the land to which the claimant is entitled, and in which
the survey of the claim cannot be made in a reasonable time, to be
fixed by the Commissioners, the Commissioners shall determine the
claim by directing a grant of other land in exchange, or by the issue
of scrip of equivalent value, exercisable only within twelve months

Notwithstanding anything in the said Acts contained, the Commis¬
sioners may admit to hearing the claimants in claims 64 (Captain

TRADE MARKS REGISTRATION ACT.—Notice.
—Mr. STREETER, 18, New Bond-street, W., having registered
the following distinctive marks for the celebrated 18-carat gold
jewellery and machine made English keyless lever watches manufac¬
tured by him, viz: For jewerlery, E.W.S.18, and for watches, the
figure of an Hour Glass, gives notice that any infringement of the said
marks, will be followed by legal proceedings.
FREE TRADE in SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to ob¬
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127, to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compulsory hall-marking, is (1) un¬
just, seeing that no other suilar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy: (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstacle to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths work. The tax has been condemued as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of cpinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application should be made to the undersigned,

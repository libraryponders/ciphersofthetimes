POURDON's GAUGES.—Messrs. DEWRANCE
and Co. hereby give notice, that Mr. BOURDON's PATENT
for PRESSURE and VACUUM GAUGES having EXPIRED, they
will cease to sell his manufacture, and that henceforth they will vend
instruments of their own construction with their patented improve¬
ments at greatly reduced prices, and will also guarantee the accurate
working of every gauge manufactured by them for two years from date
of sale. — Phoenix Foundry, 176, Great Dover-street, Borough.
CAUTION.—BOURDON's PRESSURE GAUGES.
—Mr. E. BOURDON, 74, Faubourg du Temple, Paris, begs to
announce that his engagement with Messrs. Dewrance and
the sale of his patent gauges, having expired, he has APPOINTED
Messrs. NEGRETTI and ZAMBRA, the well-known instrum
makers, of Hatton-garden, London, as his WHOLESALE AGENTS,
from whom prices (greatly reduced) and terms may be obtained.
Mr. Bourdon directs the attention of engineers to the fact that the
gauges now sold by Messrs. Dewrance and Co. and others, as "Bour¬
don's patent gauges" are not of his manufacture, and that he is in
no way connected with any makers in England, his gauges having
always been, and still continue to be, made at his factory in Paris.

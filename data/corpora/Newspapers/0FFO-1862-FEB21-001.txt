CHURCH-RATE ABOLITION.—At a MEET¬
ING of the Church-rate Abolition Committee, held at Fendall's
Hotel, Westrinster, February 19, 1862,
Sir CHAS. DOUGLAS Bart., M.P., in the chair,
It was resolved—
1. That the rejection of the Church-rate Abolition Bill having been
sought on the plea that, until the House of Commons had rescinded
its previous decisions in favour of total abolition, no successful attempt
couid be made to effect a settlement of the question on a different
basis; and the Speaker having given his casting vote against the bill on
the assumption that it was the wish of the House to deal with the
subject in some other way, it is obviously the duty of those who are
responsible for such a result to produce without delay a scheme which
will give effect to their expressed desires.
"2. That this Committee learns with satisfaction that it is the
intention of Sir John Trelawny to afford to the opponents of his bill
facilities for the fulfilment of their implied pledge, by deferring the
second reading of his own bill until ample opportunity has been
afforded to them of taking the opinion of Parliament on the measure.
which it is their wish to pass into a law.
"3. That meanwhile, the Committee recommend the opponents of
church-rates to hold themselves in readiness to resist any opjectionable
proposal, as also to put forth renewed efforts to promote the passing of
the Abolition Bill, when it shall become evident that no other satisfac¬
tory measure cau be submitted to Parliament."
By order of the Committee.

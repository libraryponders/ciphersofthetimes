EXPANDING and MECHANICALLYFITT

RIFLE-SHOT.—To the Editor of the Dublin Evening Mail.—
sir.—I received the following answer from Mr. John Rigby ("the
Manton" of Dublin) to a question as to wheth
the expea n n ing or
mechanically-fitting rifle-shot ranges the farther. "21, Sull
stret, .
Dublin, June 30. Captain Norton.—Dear Sir.—The mechanically¬
fitting bulicts range decidedly farther than the lead in small bores,
and for the reason which you correctly surmise—they have less friction,
and the power is not absorded in expanding them. I am yours ir
John Rigby." More than 20 years ago, when, at the request of H.R.H.
Prince George of Cambridge, I blew up, with my mechanically fitting
rifle-shell, at one shot, the representative of an ammunition waggon
on the Pier-head at Brighton, and explained to him that in 1818 I.
devised the elongated expanding shot, borrowing the idea from 
expanding lotus with base of the Malay tube dart, and that in 1823
I devised the mechanically fitting elongated rifle shot from the meci
nically fitting spherical bullet of Standenmeyer's rifled air-gun, H.R.H.
replied, in "wing-ed words," "I know all about it; it has already been
so fully explained to me." Fortified by this assurance, in 1860 1 for¬
warded a memorial in due form to H.R.H., praying for the Ordnance
pension (£500 a-year), which had been promised to me by Government
about 20 years before, when the late Sir George Murray was Master¬
Gencral of the Ordnance, for my inventions and improvements in
military projectiles. H.R.H., with the concurrence of the late Secre¬
tary of State for War, referred my memorial to the Ordnance Select
Committee of Woolwich, who, in their official report thereon, ignored
the facts set forth in my memorial, although corroborated by the offi¬
cial testimony of General Sir Richard Airey, who constantly saw me
practice with my mechanically-fitting elongated rifle-shot and shell at
Woolwich in the summer of 1823.—J. Norton, late Captain 34th Regi¬

SHIPWRECK.—The barge Imperial, Captain Sim¬
mons, trader between Maldon and London, sprang a leak and
was lost off the Mouse Light, Essex coast, on the 15th October, 1862.—
The benevolent are earnestly solicited to CONTRIBUTE towards
raising a FUND for reinstating Captain CORNELIUS SIMMONS in
a position to resume his business as a coasting trader. He had been
assisted to purchase the Imperial, and was repaying the debt regularly.

to support. We, the undersigned, sympathize deeply, and readily under¬
take to receive and acknowledge all remittances on his behalf, and will
be happy to furnish further particulars by post.—Wm. Smee, ship¬
owner, Malden, Essez: and Edward Wearer, outfitter, 29, Regent¬

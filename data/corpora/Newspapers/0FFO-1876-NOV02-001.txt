THERE have been, during the last years, in this
column, paragraphs appearing to have relation to the writer; the
shadow could not be grasped, but created the persistent impression of
smister purpose: being utterly at variance with any true incident in
the life of the writer, no one intimate would heed the possibility that
such could exist. The writer has not an acknowledged foe; why, there¬
fore should those appearing to be such have employed this column to
create other than a true impression of one whose only paragraphs have
been those of January 21st and 27th and February 4th, 1874? An
enemy will gradually undermine the outposts before attempting the
fortress; i1 your outposts be attacked or defenteless, or your for¬
tress unconsejous of danger, where is your security I—Oct. 25th, 1876.

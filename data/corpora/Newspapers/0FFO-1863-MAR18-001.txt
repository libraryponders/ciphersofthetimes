EGAL NOTICE.—To Railway Companies, Con¬
tractors, Landed Proprietors, Shippers, Iron Founders, Wire
Fence Makers, and others.—Whereas, FRANCIS MORTON, of
James-street, Liverpool, in the county of Lancaster, engineer, having
obtained LETTERS PATENT for "Improvements in the Construc¬
tion of Posts or Pillars for Wire and Iron Fences," which are dated
the 31st of March, 1859, and amended by disclaimer 4th July, 1861, and
having ascertained that imitations of these improvements had been
attempted and advertised by various parties in the United Kingdom,
brought an action before the Court of Session, in Scotland, against
Robert Middleton, commission agent and wire merchant, of No. 3,
Greenside-street, Edinburgh, for an infringement of said Letters
Patent, in which action issues were adjusted and tried before the Lord
President and a Jury, on the 22d, 23d, and 24th days of December
last, and a unanimous verdict upon all the issues raised, was returned
in favour of the said Francis Morton, thereby establishing the patent.
And further, the said Robert Middleton having by his counsel moved
the first division of the said Court of Session for a new trial, on the
ground of the said verdict being centrary to evidence, in support of
which it was pleaded that the foresaid specification was a defective
specification, and also that the invention had partly been in use before
the date of the patent: the Judges of the said Division, after hearing

patent, and having made avizandum, they, on the 6th of March, 1863,
unanimously refused the motion, thereby sustaining the validity of the
patent.
Notice is therefore hereby given, that all persons who have manufac¬

posts or pillars, have been guilty of an INFRINGEMENT of the said
LETTERS PATENT, and have rendered themselves liable in damages
therefor; and that all persons who may hereafter manufacture, sell,
buy, contract for, or use any imitation of the said posts or pillars shall
be guilty of an infringement of the said letters patent, and will be pro¬

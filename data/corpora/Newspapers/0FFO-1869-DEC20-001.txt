CAUTION.—HOWARDS PATENT EASY
CHAIRS and SOFAS. All of genuine manufacture have a label
attached, with number of patent and address of patentee, 26 and 27,
Berners-street, Oxford-street, W., and Cleveland Works.
CAUTION.—BETTS'S CAPSULE PATENTS are
being infringed by importation of capsules made in contravention
of his rights, which necessarily are numerous, Betts being the original
inventor and sole maker in the United Kingdom.—1, Wharf-road,
City-road, London; and Bordeaux, France.—April8, 1863
CAUTION.—Sir James Murray's Fluid Magnesia.—
The public and shippers are CAUTIONED against IMITA¬

sent themselves falsely as being his travellers and coming direct from
his establishment, desires to caution the public against such impostors,
and to state that his representatives do not call upon consumers.—
Victoria Works, Birmingham.
CAUTION.—The Registrar-General's Returns show
an alarmingly increased mortality from scarlet and other forms
of fever. The highest medical authorities consider impure water a
most fruitful source of such diseases, and as no water stored in a cis¬
tern is ever puré, it should never be drunk unless properly filtered,
and the latest and best system of so doing is that—requiring no atren¬
tion on the part of servants and others—introduced by the LONDON
and GENERAL WATER PURITYING COMPANY (Limited),
No. 157, Strand (four doors from Somerset-house), where the process
can be viewed and full particulars obtained, Read "Water, its Im¬
purities and Purification," per post, 3..

making coffee known; Ach's celebrated, Filtering Reirigerator;
Ann's P'iston Freezing Muchine and Wine Cooler, used in all parts of
the world; Ash's Improved Double-wall Ice Water Pitcher (with
inside tube), to be used with or without ice; Ash's noted Freezing
Powuers; Simpson's Seltzogenes, &c., are now the sole property of the
Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company, who issue gratis a descrip¬
tive pamphlet. Legal proceedings will be taken against any person in¬
fringing the compan
rights. —PISTON FREEZING
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 315e, Oxford-street (near Hare¬
wood-gatel.
CAUTION.—FARROW and JACKSON, the origi¬
nal manufacturers of IRON WINE BINS, with "separate rest
for each bottle," in their registration, No. 4,343, and also in their
second registration, No. 4,695, claim as the purpose of utility of their
design that "any bottle may be removed from the rack without dis¬
turbing the others." Success having, as usual, produced imitations,
purchase s are requested to notice that each bin bears a label, "Far¬
row and Jackson, London and Paris." The hins may be had of all
ironmongers, or of the manutacturers, 18, Great Tower-street, 8, Hay¬
market, or 58, Mansell-Street, London, and 23, rue du Pont Neuf,
Paris. N.B. Illustrated prices casalogues on application.
CAUTION.—To Purchasers of the "AXE BRAND"
CLOTHING.—The registered trade-mark, bearing the above name
of "Axe Brand," has been so closely imitated by some unprincipled
persons that the propretors, Messrs. FAVELL and BOUSFIELDS,
12, St. Mary-axe, London, E.C., feel it a duty to insert this
CAUTION, for their own protection and that of their customers.
The undersigned will Reward any person giving such information
as shall lead to the conviction of the parties guilty of the infringe¬
ment of the trade-mark in question.
SAMUEL POTTER, 35, King-Street, Cheapside, London,
Solicitor for Messrs. Favell and Bousfields, the Registered
Proprietors of the "Axe Brand" Trade-mark.
IMPORTANT CAUTION.—The unprecedented suc¬
cess of ROWLAND'S MACASSAR OIL for the hair has caused
counterfelters to spring up in every possible variety. Some so far copy
the labels as frequently to deceive the unwary; some offer to dispose
of the recipe of a Macassar oil, with other recipes of a similar cha¬
racter, for a few postage stamys; while others profess to manufacture.
the real G)urticle at a considerably reduced price, if the public will
only purchase it. The name of these wretched counterfeiters is
"Legion," and calls for more than usual care on the part of pur¬
chasers as to where they make theirselection of articles for the tollet."

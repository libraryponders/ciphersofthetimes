advantages derived from this invention are that vision impaired is pre¬
served and strengthened, very aged persens are enabled to employ their
sight at the most minute occupation, can see with these lenses of a much
less magnifying power, and they do not require the frequent changes to
the dangerous effects of further powerful assistance. The adoption of
spectacles to imperfect vision by experienced persons is indeed of vital
importance—39, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly, opposite the York Hotel.

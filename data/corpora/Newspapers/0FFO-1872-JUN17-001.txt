used to induce purchasers of plated wares to buy articles of very in¬
ferior qualty offered for sale as "Elkingion's best Electro-plate, to
warn the public against purchasing such articles, and will be at all
times glad to verify any that may be sent for that purpose to either

having been made to imitate the process, notice is hereby given, that
proceedings will be taken against any person found INFRINGING
this PATENT. Each agent is supplied with a certificate, and the trade¬
mark attached to each article is a blue, heart-shaped ticket, containing
the words—Sanitary cloth, shower, not air proof.—D. Nicoll and Co.,

CAUTION.—in calling the attention of the trade
to a recent decision in the House of Lords, in the case of
Wotherspoon v. Currie," whereby our exclusive right to the use of
the word "Glenfield" in connexion with Starch is indisputably esta¬
blished, wouid also intimate that this decision renders the sale of the
starch made by the defendant illegal, and will subject the seller of it
to a penaity of £10,000. We beg to intimate to those who may have
ben induced to buy it, that to save them from total loss we will
allow 20s. per cwt, for it at the Glenfield Starch Works, Paisley, in
exchange for the genuine article, at the current price. This will
entall a loss upon ourselves, as the packets will be broken up and sold
for waste starch, but it will at the same time be the means of rendering
the artiele useless for further deception. Any information that will
lead to conviction will be rewarded.—R. WOTHERSPOON and Co.
PECIAL NOTICE.—To avoid further misunder¬
standing, it is necessary to inform the public that the only house

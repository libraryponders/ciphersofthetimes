To the MEMBERS of the MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,
King-street, Cheapside.
My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,
Vacaney having just occurred among your Direc¬
tors, I solicit the honour of the appointment.
The sound principles upon which this Society is based—an entire
mutuality of interests among all the Members have long since been
sanctioned by public approbation. I have watched the development of
those principies in the rise and progress of the Society with much in¬
terest; my father was among its founders, and for many years one of
the Auditors, and your suffrages would have placed him in the Direc¬
tion but for his death a few days before the election. I also for nearly
three years have held the appointment of one of the Auditors.
These circumstances encourage me to seek the honour of a seat in the
Direction; and, should I be elected, I will endeavour faithfully to
perform the duties devolving on me, and to promote the best interests
of the Society. I have the honour to be 
Yours faith full

WHITEFRIARS GLASS WORKS, London, E.C.
—In the Paris Exhibition.—"Messrs. POWELL and Co., manu¬
facturers, of Temple-street, Whitefriars, whose stall is occupied only
by samples from their show rooms. Although unpretentious, there is,
perhaps, no glass in the building more beautifully clear and light. To
show the purity of the material in which they work, this firm exhibit
beneath their stall a large block of glass, of 11 cwt., just as run out.
It is two feet in thickness, but it is so perfectly clear that small type
print can be read through it without difficulty. They exhibit, as de
several of the other English manufacturers, excellent imitations of the
Venctian glass, which I confess, in my opinion, are very far superior
in beauty either to the originals or the modern Venetian imitations;
inasmuch, as while they retain the quaint forms and intricate manipu¬
lation, the glass is far purer and clearer than the old or modern Venetian,
and the forms are true and straight, whereas the Venetian glasses and
ings are with hardly an exception, irregular, crooked, and, so to speak,
lopsided. A claret glass, although its manipulation may be wonderful, if
it is all on one side, and the rim forms an imperfect cirele, has an un¬
pleasant effect. The English Venetian glass does not as yet present all
those curious windings and twistings, nor has it attained to the junc¬
tion of various colours in the material of the glass itself, the one
shading off almost imperceptibly into another, which the Venetians so
excelled in; but the English manufacturers are upon the track, and
when they have attained these, and united them to the clearness of
glass and perfection of workmanship, which are all their own, they
will produce chandeliers, vases, and glasses to which the old Venetian will
bear no comparison whatever, except in the eyes of those savants who
think that nothing whatever is worth looking at which has not the seal
of age stamped upon it. Messrs. Powell have a large number of glasses
and jugs engraved with various ferns, with holly, &c., and many of
them are surprisingly cheap. They have some new and very pretty
finger glasses, with slender stands to hold single flowers rising from
their centres."—From the Standard, 12th April, 1867.

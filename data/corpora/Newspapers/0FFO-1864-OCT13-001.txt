ALUNACY.—SINGLE PATIENTS.
OFFICE of COMMISSIONERS in LUNACY, 19, Whitehall¬

THE Commissioners in Lunacy having reason to be¬
lieve that many persons of unsound mind are illegally received or
taken charge of, and that the law relating to insane persons not in
asylums or licensed houses, but under individual care as "Single
Patients," is extensively violated, desire to draw the attention of
medical practitioners and others to the provisions of the 8th and 9th
Victoria, cap. 100., sec. 90, as amended by the 8th section of 16 and 17
Vic., cap. 96.
By these enactments no person (anless-he derives no profit from the
charge or be a committee appointed by the Lord Chancellor) can re¬
ceive one patient in any unlicensed house ; neither can any person
take care or charge of any one patient as a lunatic or alleged lunatic
without the same form of order and medical certificates as are re¬
quired upon the admission of a patient into a licensed house, copies of
which are to be sent to the Commissioners in Lunacy, together with
other particulars, which are fully stated in printed instructions to be
obtained on application at the office of the Commissioners, 19, White¬
hall-place.
By the first-mentioned Act every person neglecting to comply with
the requirements of the Statute is liable to prosecution for a misde¬
meanour.
By the interpretation clause the word "lunatic" is declared to mean
"Every insane person, and every person being an idiot or lunatic, or
of unsound mind.
According to the law as laid down by the Judges of the Superior
Courts, the provisions and penalties of the Act apply to all cases of
insaue persons taken or retained under care or charge in unlicensed
houses, whether or not they were of unsound mind when first received.
The Commissioners will feel it their duty in cases of violation of the
law hereafter brought under their notice, to proceed by indictment
against the offending parties.

CAUTION.—MENIER's CHOCOLATE (Chocolat¬

blance in the form of the cakes colour of the covering, arrangement of
the label, and that quasi-similarity of names which imitators have in¬
vented for the purpose of passing off their chocolate as the Chocolat¬
Menier, the purchasers should look for the trade marks, the real name
upon the back of each division of the cake, and the signature Menier
upon the seal of the cover. Imitators try especially the fine quality
(yellow paper) at the price marked 2s. per pound, because it is this that
the public have particularly adopted; it gives the highest satisfaction
both for its low price and its excellent quality. Wholesale Menier,

the Royal Academy will not hold itself accountable in any case of in¬
jury or loss, nor can it undertake to pay the carriage of any package.
The prices of works to be disposed of may be communicated to the
secretary.
Artists sending works for exhibition are earnestly requested to abstain
from giving any fee whatever to the servants or other persons em¬

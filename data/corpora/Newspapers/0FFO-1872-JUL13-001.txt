and sincerely APOLOGIZE to Mr. Edmund Walter Pook, and to his
father, Mr. Ebenezer Whicher Pook, jointly and severally, for having
during the last 13 months sent them anonymous letters of the most
profane and scurrilous nature, all of which I now declare to be untrue,
and that I was the sole author of such letters, reflecting upon both
son and father, relating to the so-called Eltham Murder; and I now
declare that I firmly believe that the said Edmund Walter Pook was
not in any way concerned or had knowledge of the said murder. And
I beg to offer my heartfelt thanks to the said Mr. Edmund Walter
Pook and his father, Mr. Ebenezer Whicher Pook, for accepting this
apology, instead of taking such proceedings in law as the case would
have justified their o doing

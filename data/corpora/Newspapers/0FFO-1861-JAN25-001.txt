LIVERPOOL.—Mr. S. C. HALL, F.S.A., Editor of
the Art Journal, &c., will, THIS EVENNG (Friday), the 25th
inst., at the Royal Institution, Liverpool, commencing at 8 o'clock, de¬
liver his LECTURE on the AUTHORS of the AGE. from personal ac¬
quaintance. The list comprises nearly all the great men and women who
have flourished during the carlier half of the 19th century, commencing
with Hannah More, and terminating with Lady Morgan, including Words-¬
worth, Southey, Moore, Amelia Opie, James Montgomery, Campbell,
Hood, Hook, Miss Landon, Mrs. Hemans, Miss Mitford, Coleridge, and
many others who made the age renowned and mankind their debtors
for all time. The object of the lecturer is to "do with his pen what the
artist does with his pencil;" and although within the limits of two hours
he can produce little more than sketches of the many great persons he
introduces to an audience, he endeavours, not without success, to bring
them palpably before the mind's eye of his hearers. It is a remarkable
fact that a gentleman is enabled to do this from a personal knowledge
of all the renowned people whose works are the delight of the millions
who speak the Anglo-Saxon tongue. Some of them were aged when
Mr. Hall knew them, 30 or 40 years ago: but there is no one of them who
does not live in the hearts of the existing generation, or whose memory
will die out for centuries to come. Cards of admission—to the hall. 2s.
each, to the gallery, 1s, each—may be obtained at the Courier-office; of
Mr. Joseph Mayer, silversmith, Lord-street; Mr. Abbott, upholsterer,

PUBLIC APOLOGY.—To Messrs. SPIERS and
POND. Refreshment Contractors, New Bridge-street, Blackfriars.
Gentlemen, I hereby acknowledge with regret that I have spread a
report that you had made an offer of composition with your creditors
of 4s. in the £, and that you would be in the Gazette if it were not
accepted, and that having seen a circular I knew it to be true. I
deeply regret to have been the means of propagating such a slander
against you, so unfounded and untrue, and can assure you the words
about the circular must have escaped me unintentionally, as it was not
the fact that I had seen one. I beg to make this public apology as a
partial act of reparation, and I beg you to accept this expression of
my deep regret at having been the instrument of doing you an injury.

WPPING FOREST.—An Association has been
formed for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Persons
(other than the Lords of Manors) who, since 1851, have acquired, for
valuable consideration, their properties in Epping Forest.
A Scheme has been published by the City of London, by which they
propose absolutely to confiscate all such properties in the Forest as
have not been built upon, and to fix a rent-charge upon such proper¬
ties as have been built upon, at a rate varying from £10 to over £50
per acre per annum. The number of holdings affected by this scheme
is over 1,000.
The amount of such annual rent-charge is about £6,400 per annum,
the redeemable value of which is fixed by the Scheme at 25 years
purchase, or about £160,000.
The following are a few examples taken from the Scheme:—

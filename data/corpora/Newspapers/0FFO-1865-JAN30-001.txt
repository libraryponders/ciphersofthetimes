NOTICE.—BROKERS.—City of London.—
Whereas, by an Act of Parliament passed in the 6th year of the
reign of her late Majesty, Queen Anne, it is enacted "That all per¬
sons that shall act as Brokers within the city of London and Liberties
thereof shall from time to time be admitted by the Court of Mayor
and Aldermen of the said city for the time being, under such restric¬
tions and limitations for their honest and good behaviour as
that Court shall think fit and reasonable"; and by an Act of Parlia¬
ment passed in the 57th year of the reign of his late Majesty, King
George III., after reciting the said first-mentioned Act, it is enacted
"That if any person shall take upon him to act as a Broker, or employ.
or cause, permit, or suffer any person or persons to be employed with,
under, or for him, to act as such within the said city and liberties,
not being admitted in pursuance of the said recited Act, every such per¬
son so offending shall forfeit and pay to the use of the Mayor and
Commonalty and citizens of the said city, for every such offence, the
sum of £100, to be recovered by action of debt, in the name of the
Chamberlain of the said city, in any of his Majesty's Courts of Re¬
cord"; and whereas, there is great reason to believe that many persons
who are not admitted by the Court of Mayor and Aldermen do exercise
the office of a Broker, and employ others under them to act as such,
within the said city and liberties, in contempt and violation of the law,
to the great injury and prejudice of those who are duly admitted to be
brokers of this city, and to the manifest hazard of merchants and
others employing persons who are under no restrictions or limitations,
nor have given bond with sureties for their honest and good behaviour,
as brokers regularly admitted by the Court of Aldermen are subjected
to:—Notice is therefore hereby given, that whoever will give IN¬
FORMATION, either to the Comptroller, at his office in Guildhall, or
to Mr. John Thornton, 2, Guildhall-chambers, Basinghall-street,
receiver of brokers' rents, of any offence committed contrary to the
stid Act, shall receive a REWARD of FIFTY POUNDS on convic¬
tion of the offender, who will be prosecuted on such information at
the expense of the city
WOODTHORPE.
HYDROPULT.—Caution. —Devices in mitation of
the HYDROPULT are often placed "on sale" at many iron¬
mongery and seed establishments throughout the city and provinces,
and are caiculated in appearance to deceive the unsuspecting. Each
hydropult has a brass label attached to one cylinder, on which is
stamped the following, to wit, "The Hydropult, Vose's Patent,
manufactured only by Griffiths and Browett, Birmingham. Charles
Pomeroy Button, proprietor, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London."
In this connexion it may be well to state that the hydro¬
pult is the only force-pump in the market, weighing but 81b.,
that will throw seven or eight gallons of water per minute a distance of
50 feet when worked by the power of one man. The hydropult will
draw water horizontally, if necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose,
and force it through delivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet. The
hydropult can be used for all purposes to which a hydrant or force¬
pumpsis applicable, and in many situations where other contrivances
are useless. The hydropult has been recommended as an efficient and
useful fre engine by many of the principal fire insurance companies of
Great Britain. Hydropults have been ordered by the War Department
as fire engines. Robert Hogg. LL.D. and F.L.S., Shirley Hibbard,
Esq., F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent florist), and other
well-known gentlemen recommend the hydropult as an invaluable
garden implement. The hydropult has been recommended by the
Gardeners' Chronicle, Journal of Horticulture, Gardeners Magazine,
Daily Telegraph, Liverpool Daily Post, Commercial Daily List, Illus¬
trated News of the World, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Maga¬
zine. City Press, Insurance Gazette, and other first class journals
throughout Great Britain. An Illustrated Prospectus, with testi
monials, sent free on application to CHARLES POMEROY
BUTTON 142 and 143, Cheapside, London.
THE GROVER and BAKER SEWING MACHINE

gent-street, London, W., and 59, Bold-Street, Liverpool.

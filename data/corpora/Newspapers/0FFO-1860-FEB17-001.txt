THE late Captain HARRISON.—The official
collecting books have just been issued to us. We beg to say that
we shall be most happy to receive the donations of those friends
and admisers of the late gallant and generous-hearted seaman who
may desire to pay the last tribute of respectful esteem for his memory
by their kindly and generous sympathy to the living. It is earnestly
hoped that the memorial will be such an one as will be a full and
practical expression of that almost universal grief which was expe¬
rienced at his untimely end, and which made each one of us feel as if
he had lort a dear and valued friend. If anything earthly can tend to
alleviate the sorrow and bind up the bleeding wounds of his broken¬
hearted family, it will surely be found in such a combined expression
of respect and sympathy as that now contemplated. This expression
must be made alike worthy of the proverbially generous character of
Englishmen and of him whose character embodied that fine combina¬
tion of all those high, noble, and kindly qualities which they ever
delight to honour. It is men of this stamp who make England
what she is among the nations of the earth, and has made
her history so glorious a record of noble and heroic deeds. Directions
have been given that to any friend kindly forwarding donations, and
expressing a with to possess a memento of the late Captain, a copy
of one of the last portraits taken of him on board shall be sent, gratuit¬
ously, with the acknowledgment of the donation. Post-office order and
drafts to the undersigned, to be crossed "Union Bank of London,"

GEORGE SWAN NOTTAGE, Managing Partner.
Friends in any part of America who may see this advertisement
and wish to unite in this tribute of respect may do so by forward¬
ing their drafts (crossed Duncan, Sherman, and Co.), to Mr. Theops.

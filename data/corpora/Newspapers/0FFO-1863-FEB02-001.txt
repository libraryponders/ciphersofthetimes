CONSPIRACY.—Whereas several evil-disposed PER¬

succeeded in many instances by these false representations in inveigling
honest, industrious, young persons to quit their home and proceed
abroad, where they invariably find themselves entrapped into houses
of ill-fame without the means of escape. This infamous traffic has of
late so alarmingly increased and bafiled all endeavours to check it,
that recourse is had to this public notice, in the hope that it will pre¬
vent English girls from too readily listening to any such proposals
proceeding from questionable parties, and in all such cases they are
requested to notily the same without delay to Mr. Pollalky, who is
instructed by Mr. G. B. Talbot (the secretary of the London Society for
the Protection of Young Females, 28, New Broad-street), to investigate,
free of all charge, the character of parties in England and abroad, hold¬
ing out such inducements.—IGNATIUS POLLAKY, Home and

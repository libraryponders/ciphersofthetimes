PROCLAMATION
PROHIBITING the IM¬
PORTATION of CATTLE from GIPPS LAND and MORN¬
INGTON, by the Honourable John Hyde Harris, Superintendent of the
Province of Otago.—Whereas by proclamation under my hand, and
issued under the public seal of the Province of Otago, at Dunedin, the
18th day of January last, and published of that date in the Pro¬
vincial Government Gazette,
John Hyde Harris, by virtue of the
powers delegated to and vested in me in that behalf, did thereby pro¬
claim and declare that, from and after the date thereof, all the Aus¬
tralian ports with the exception of Gipps Land and Mornington, in
the Colony of Victoria, in Australia, should be deemed infected dis¬
tricts, places or ports, within the meaning and for the purposes of the
Diseased Cattle Act, 1861
and that no cattle from and after the
date thereof, until further notice, should be permitted to be imported
into the Province of Otago from any of the said Australian ports,
with the exception of Gipps Land and Mornington aforesaid.
And whereas it has been made to appear to me that a certain con¬
tagious or infectious disease has broken out in Gipps Land and Morn¬
ington aforesaid, and it is expedient to declare that such districts are
infected within the meaning of the said Act, and to prohibit the im¬
portation of cattle into the said Province from the said districts.
Now, therefore, I, the said John Hyde Harris, by virtue of the
powers delegated to and vested in me in this behalf, do hereby re¬
scind the said exceptions, and do proclaim and declare that, from and
after the date hereof, Gipps Land and Mornington shall be deemed
infected districts within the meaning and for the purposes of the above¬

Given under my hand, and issued under the public seal of the
Province of Otago, at Dunedin, this 16th day of February, 1864.

POLOGY.—1, the undersigned, John Groome
(trading as John Groome and Sons), of the Crypt, Chester, Wine
and Spirit Merchant, do hereby acknowledge that three hogsheads of
whisky, purporting to be the genuine WHISKY of JOHN JAME¬
SON and SON, of the Bow-street Distillery, Dublin, and contained in
casks, bearing an IMITATION of ther BRAND and NUMBERS,
but which, in fact, was not their genuine whisky, have been forwarded
from my Stores at Chester, and on my account, in execution of an
order for three hogsheads of their whisky. I had no personal know¬
ledge of the transaction, exceedingly regret it, and am much indebted
to John Jameson and Son for having, after investigating the circum¬
stances, consented to discontinue the proceedings which they had
caused to be instituted against me. 1 paying all costs of, and incidental
to, such proceeding. — Dated this 6th day of October, 1

JOHN GROOME.
FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD.—We,

bond, in a cask or casks, or in a bottle or botties, bearing any of our
respective names or trade marks, or any imitation of them; also any¬
one delivering our whiskies in a cask or casks from which the date of
the year of bonding has been removed for the purpose of deceiving

a reward of Fifty Pounds sterling to anyone who will give such private
information as may lead to the conviction of any person who has com¬
mitted any of the abovenamed offences. Communications upon this

TAXATION of SILVER PLATE.—"It is a well¬
known fact that the branches of production in which fewest
improvements are made are those with which the revenue officer in¬
terferes, and that nothing, in general, gives a greater impulse to im¬
provements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax
which narrowed the market for it."—John Stuart Mill's "Principles
of Political Economy." Buyers of silver plate need be under no ap¬
prehension that the abolition of the duty will in the slightest degree
affect Hall marking, beyond the withdrawal of the Queen's bead or
duty mark. An effort will be made to obtain the REPEAL of the
DUTIES upon GOLD and SILVER PLATE in the next Session of


information application should be
made to EDWARD J.WATHERSTON, 12, Pall-mall east, London.

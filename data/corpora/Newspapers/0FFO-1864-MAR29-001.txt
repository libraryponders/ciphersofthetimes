—Mr. E. BOURDON, 74, Faubourg du Temple, Paris, begs
announce that his engagement with Messrs. Dewrance and Co., fo
the sale of his patent gauges, having expired, he has APPOINTED
Messrs. NEGRETTI and ZAMBRA, the well-known instr
makers, of Hatton-garden, London, as his WHOLESALE AGENTS,
from whom prices (greatly reduced) and terms may be obtained.
Mr. Bourdon directs the attention of engineers to the fact that the
gauges now sold by Messrs. Dewrance and Co. and others, as "Bour¬
don's patent gauges" are not of his manufacture, and that he is in
no way connected with any makers in England, his gauges having
always been, and still continue to be, made at his factory in Paris,

of London, for an INFRINGEMENT by me of GIRARD's PATENT
for bluc and violet dyes, I submitted t o a perpetual injunction issuing
from the High Court of Chancery, to restrain me, my workmen,
and agents from making and selling, or selling, any blue or violet dye
made according to the process described in the said patent, and from
otherwise in any manner infringing the said letters patent; and
whereas since the said injunction was awarded I have made and sold
blue and violet dyes in infringement of the said letters patent, and
have thereby subjected myself to imprisonment for contempt of the
High Court of Chancery, but at my earnest entreaty the said plain¬
tiffs have abstained for this time only from moving the said Court
for that purpose; Now, therefore, I express my regret for having dis¬
regarded the said injunction, and hereby notify that I have discon¬
tinued to make and sell, or sell any blue and violet dyes made in
frand of the rights of the said plaintiffs, and I undertake to account
to the said plaintiffs for all profits made by such sales as hereinbefore

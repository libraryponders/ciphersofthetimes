WARNING to TRAVELLERS.—The Proprietors
of some HOTELS at BERLIN have for some time endeavoured
to mislead the travelling public, by circulating false statements respect¬
ing some of the most frequented hotels of Berlin; stating that the
latter are either full, too expensive, too distant, or unclean. These
reports have been circulated partly by means of handbills thrown into
railway carriages, partly by their commissioners sent to the railways
o h e purpose of enticing travellers on arrival into their hotels.
While denouncing these statements as false and calumnious, we beg
the travelling public will give no credit to such and similar reports,
obviously circulated to increase their custom by false pretences, but
to take up their abodes as usual in these hotels best known or recom¬
mended to them. The undersigned hotel proprictors further beg to
inform the travelling public that they only send their carriages and
commissioners to the railway termini when the arriving travellers
order the same beforehand.

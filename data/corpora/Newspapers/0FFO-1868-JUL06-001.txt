the vessel to which it is applied. The Lord Chancellor, in his judg¬
ment on the 8th instant, said "that the capsules are not used merely

the beer from injury and in ensuring its genuineness."—February 20.

and the Prince and Princess of Wales, beg to state that their ONLY
ADDRESS is 38 and 39, Bruton-street, corner of New Bond-street, W.
CAUTION.—The CISTERN and other FILTERS,

of by Dr. Frankland during the late visitation of cholera (see The
Times, Oct. 24th, 1866), can only be obtained at ATKINS', 62, Fleet-st.
CAUTION.—Messrs. S. and B. SOLOMONS,
opticians to the Government, beg to caution their custemers
agains purchasing spectacles of travellers in the country using their
name. Messrs. S. have no travellers, therefore persons desirous of
obtaining the genuine tinted lenses should apply only direct to them,
at 39, Albemarie-street, Piccadilly, opposite Crawley's Hotel,
CAUTION.—PILLISCHER's QUEEN's READ¬
ING and MICROSCOPIC LAMPS as supplied by him to Her
Majesty and the Royal Family. The public are cautioned against in¬
ferior imitations, M. Pillischer, optician, 88, New Bond-street, being
the sole inventor and manufacturer of these celebrated lamps. Draw¬
ings and prices post free.
CAUTION.—In consequence of frequent misrepre¬
sentations, E. MOSES and SON, merchant tailors, outfittere, &c.,

London Houses.
Corner of Minories and Aldgate.
New Oxford-street, corner of Hart-street.
Corner of Tottenham-court-road and Euston-road.
Country Branch, Bradford. Yorkshire.
CAUTION.—Water Filtration.—To prevent ms¬
takes the public are informed that the latest patented filter in
general use is the DANCHELL PATENT CISTERN FILTER
(patent sealed Sept. 29, 1863), which has superseded all others (vide Pro¬
fessor Frankland's reports to the Registrar-General, July, 1866, and Nov.,
1867), insuring as it does a censtant supply of the purest water without
filling or any attention whatever. Can be rented if preferred in London,

be had in London of the LONDON and GENERAL
WATER PURIFYING COMPANY, 157, Strand, four doors from
Somerset-hou.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes or Refrigerators. —The
WENHAM LAKE ICE COMPANY give notice that every
REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of their manufacture, bears their name
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felony.
This notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerous
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fce Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬
sary complications, are nnequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability,
and economy. Sole office, Wenham Lake Ice Company, 140, Strand.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE¬
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the
block ice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to cau¬
tion the public against imitations of this scientific invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any other ice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprietors, the PISTON FREEZING
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 3152, Oxford-street, Londor
CAUTION.—WATER FILTERS.—Prevention of
Cholera.—Placing a filter inside a cistern is objectionable, because
it can only be cleaned when the cistern is empty. The use of animal
charcoal alone is also objectionable, because its coarse, granular state
permits animalcula and dirt to pass with the water, and moreever, the
charcoal itself soon becomes foul, and then gives back to the water the
impurities which it had previously taken from it. The only real
purifier of water is the Silicated Carbon Filter, which has been proved
by the Lancet commission to be capable of removing the organic and
saline impurities, and is so constructed as to render the passage of
animalculs physically impossible. Filters for domestic use in all sizes,
Cistern filters (if required) from 12s. 6d. upwards. Main service filters
for purifying large quantities of water. Illustrated price lists and
very information on application to the SILICATED CARBON
FILTER Co., Church-road, Battersea, S.W.

stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their involce.—

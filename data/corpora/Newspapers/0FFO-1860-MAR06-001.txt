NEW ART UNION. —Limited to 5,000 Subscribers.
—For a subscription of one quinea will be given a set of SEVEN
of the finest large LINE ENGRAVINGS ever issued, the proof impres¬
stons of which were published at 70 guineas. They are of wurld-wide
celebrity and undying interest. Each of the seven given for the guinea
subscription is of more value than the single print usually given by Art
Unions for the same sum. The plates will be destroyed so soon es the
5,000 sets are absorbed, so that each subscriber will thereupon hold a
property worth at least 10s. 6d. an impression, or £3 13s. 6d. for the set
of seven and as no more copies can be produced, it may be relied
upon that, before long, the set will be worth £7 7s., or more. Upon
application a set of the engravings will be sent for inspection anywhere
in London. Specimens may be seen, and prospectuses obtained, at
Day and Son's, lithographerr to the Queen, 6, Gate-street, Lincoln's-¬
inn-fields, London.

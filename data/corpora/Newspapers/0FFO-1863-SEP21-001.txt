CAUTION against COPIED PHOTOGRAPHS.—
Whereas several advertisements have appeared stating that the
advertisers could now produce cartes de visite by photography at a low
price. I. CAMILLE SILVY, caution all persons against such pro¬
ceedings, which infringe(the acts for the protection of property in works
of art. I may also state that perfect copies of my photographs cannot
be obtained by this method, there being always a great difference be¬
tween a spurious copy and the original proof. In order to secure, at
any time, proofs from the original plates, I have kept them in perfect
order from first to last (about 15,000 in number), and from these plates,
and these alone, the public may be sure of obtaining proofs, either of
the same size or enlarged, perfectly equal to the first.—38, Porchester¬

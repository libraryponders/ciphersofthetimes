commence on Friday, the 19th day of June, 1868, at 12 o'clock, at the

a
testiinster Bank, for and on be

plaintiff, Sarah Jane Teversham, spinster, and William John Barrett,

out of the jurisdiction, defendants.—Upon motion this day mas¬
this Court by counsel for the plaintiff, who alleged that the plaintiff
filed his bill in this Court against the defendants, and that it appears
by the affidavit of Orlando Matthews that the defendant, William
John Barrett, has been within the jurisdiction of this Court within
two years noxt before the filing of the said bill, and that all due
diligence has been used to serve the said last named defendant with a
printed copy of the said bill, but without effect, and that the said de¬
lendant cannot be found so as to be served with process, and from
inquiries at the last known place of abode of the said defendant, and
at other places where it was prohable the said defendant might be found
there is just ground to believe that the said defendant William John
Barrett has gone out of the realm, or otherwise absconded, to avoid
being served with process, and upon reading the said affidavit, this
Court doth Order that the derendant, WILLIAM JOHN BARRETT,
do APPEAR to the plaintiff's bill on or before the 29th day of June,
1868 ; and the plaintiff is to cause a copy of this order, together with a
notice thereof to the effect set forth at the foot of the 10th of the Con¬
solidated Orders, rule 6, to be inserted in the London Gazette within 14
days from the date hereof, and once in The Times newspaper for two
several weeks, within 21 days from the date hereof.
Notice.—William John Barrett, take notice that if you do not appear
pursuant to the above order, the plaintiff may enter an appearance for
you, and the Court may afterwards grant to the plaintiff such relief as
he may appear to be entitled to on his own showing.

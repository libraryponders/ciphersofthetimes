TO MEMBERS of BOTH HOUSES of PARLIA¬
MENT.—The JOHN CLARE NATIONAL FUND.—Berlin
Treaty.—The Earl of Beaconsfield on his return from Berlin adver¬
tised to the world Peace with Honour Mr. Parnell, M.P., March 14,
1878, in Parliament, said.—"They had had an animated debate on
the subject of the East; but if they had not had their ironclad fleet,
they could not have stood long in the East, and could not have had
that ironclad fleet at the Dardanelles. Now, he maintained that if it
had not been for the painstaking exertions of Mr. John Clare this
question of iron shipbuilding would not have been so much in advance
for another 10 years." Mr. Roebuck M.P.,—"But for the flect at the
Dardanelles the Russian army would have been in Constantinople."
(Cheers.) The First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Smith, at the Man¬
sion-house Banquet.—"The fleet at the Dardanelles caused the happy
result which we were now rejoicing at, of a peace with honour to this
country." (Hear, hear.) Mr. Thomas Brassey, M.P., at Birkenhead,—
"Lord Beaconsfield deserves credit for avoiding a war with Russia
which would have cost this country 100 millions sterling."—Morning
Paper, 19th April, 1879. Mr. Clare would refer those persons desirous
of learning the truth and facts of the trial of "Clare v. the Queen,"
and the indictments of the Admiralty witnesses at the Westminster
Police Court, 1863 and 1866 to the immortalizing speech of Mr. O'Don¬
nell, M.P., in the House of Commons, 14th March, 1878, also the
questions thereon put by Mr. Bisgar, M.P., to Mr. Secret ary Cross
and Mr. George Ward Hunt, vide Hansard, 1877-8. Lord Palmerston
in 1865, said:—"Clare bombard the Admiratty well, fight it out. As
they have used your patent, &c., and will be obliged to pay you, never
rest unt l you make them pay.
The metal suips constructed from
Mr. Clare's Patent of 1853 settled the Russian War, 1854-6, also pre¬
vented a war with Russia, 1878. Mr. Clare being unable to obtain from
the Admiralty attention either for claims litigated in "Clare v. the
Queen," or on those claims that have neither been before the courts
nor the subject of litigation, has no course open to him but a Select
Committee of the House of Commons.
Mr. Clare, on the above concatenated dates and facts, respectfully
appeals to Right Honourable and Honourable Members of Parlia¬
ment to support his case in the House of Commons on a Select Com¬
mittee being moved for ; and to the liperal public, on national
grounds, for assistance in purse and person to enable him to obtain
his rights on a "clear stake and no favour," so that justice may
triumph and right prevail. Hence, on public grounds, the co-ppera¬

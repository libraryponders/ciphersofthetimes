tion on the part of servants and others—introduced by the LONDON

the fact alleged against me by the Bill of Complaint, and the evidence
in support thereof, I now, to save unnecessary expense, consent to an
Injunction in the terms of the Prayer of the Bill, and to pay the costs
of the suit, and 1 shall instruct my solicitors accordingly.
I may add that you are at liberty to make what use you think pro¬
per of this letter.
I am, Gentlemen,
DOYour obedient Servant.

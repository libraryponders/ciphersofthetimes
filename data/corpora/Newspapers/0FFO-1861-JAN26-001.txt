INLAND REVENUE, Somerset House, January, 1861.
THERE being reason for believing that the practice
still extensively prevails of evading the Stamp Duties on delivery
orders by the device of directing the delivery of the goods to be made,
nominally, to the sellers themselves, and issuing the orders without

The Commissioners of Inland Revenue take this mode of bringing
to the attention of all persons whom it concerns, the enactment con¬
tained in the 23 and 24 Victoria, cap. 3, passed with the view to sup¬
press such fraudulent evasions.
The provisions of the Act are shortly as follows, viz:—
Every delivery order shall be deemed to be made and given upon a
sale or transfer, unless the contrary be expressly stated in it.
Any person who shall untruly state or siguify in an order that it is
not made or given unon a sale or transfer, shall forfeit £20.
Any person who shall by himself, or his servant, or any other person,
procure, or require the delivery of the goods specified in an order,
knowing that it contains such untrue statement, shall forfeit £20.
The Commissioners desire it to be particularly noticed, that not
only the giver of an order of this kind, and the purchaser of the goods
or-his agent who acts upon it, but any public carrier or other person
who receives the goods for delivery at any other place than the shop or
warehouse of the person who issues the order, subjects himself to this
penalty, as he cannot be ignorant of the fact of the transfer.
By order of the Board,	J. SARGENT, Secretary.

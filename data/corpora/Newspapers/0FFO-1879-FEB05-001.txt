FREE TRADE In SILVER PLATE.—Notice.—An
effort will be made in the present Session of Parliament to obe
tain perfect FREEDOM of TRADE for the HANDICRAFT of
SILVER WARE. The taxation of silver plate by means of an excise
varying from 127s to 20 per cent. upon articies of daily use, and by the
still more objectionable system of compuisory hall-marking, is (h un¬
just, seeing that no other similar trade is taxed; (2) impolitic, as
proved by the annual diminution of the trade; (3) subversive of the
recognized principles of modern fiscal legisiation; (4) contrary to the
established laws of political economy; (5) obstructive to art progress;
and (6) an insurmountable obstame to technical education in its appli¬
cation to siiversmiths work. The tax has beon condemned as inde¬
fensible by statesmen, political economists, politicians of every shade
of opinion, and notably by the press of the United Kingdom. For
further particulars application shouid be made to the under-igned,

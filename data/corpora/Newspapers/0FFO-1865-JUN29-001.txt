AMANSION, costing not less than £50,000, SAVED
from destruction by the use of the HYDROPULT. "Swakeleys,
Uxbridge, Middlesex, March 5, 1865, Mr. Charles Pomeroy Button, hydro¬
pult warehouse, 142 and 143, Cheapside, London. Sir,—I have great
pleasure in recommending your Hydropult, for Ifully believe it was the
means of saving my house from being burnt down, during a private theat¬
rical entertainment given on the night of the 23d ult. The fire broke out
from some unexplained cause, and, from the height of the fiames, no
water could be thrown up to it with buckets. Your hydropult became
therefore invaluable, and was applied so effectually that in a quarter of
an hour the fire was extinguished. Yours (signed), Thomas T. Clarke."
The hydropult which saved the premises of Mr. Clarke weighs but 81b.,
and cost but two guineas. It has brass cylinders and copper stirrup,
with 2 feet suction and 3 feet delivery hose, strainer, rose, and fire jet,
and is available for watering beds, sprinaling plants, drowning out
insects, cleansing trees from smurs, dressing with liquid manure, wash¬
ing windows, wetting sidewalks, sprinkling streets, washing carriages,
emptying cisterns, tilling barrels, a spray bath, &c.
HYDROPULTS have been recommended as an
efficient and useful fire-engine by many of the principal fire in¬
ce companies of Great Britain, and have been ordered by the
War Department for that purpose.
MYDROPULTS have been recommended as an in¬
valuable garden implement by Robert Hogg, LL.D. and F.L.S.
Shirley Hibberd, Esq., F.R.H.S., Thomas Rivers, Esq. (the eminent
florist), and other well-known gentlemen.
YDROPULTS have been recommended by the
Field, Gardeners' Chronicle, Journal of Horticulture, Gardeners'
Magazine, Daily Telegraph, Liverpoot Daily Post, Commercial Daily
List, Birmingham Journal, Mechanics' Magarine, City Press, Insur¬
ance Gazette, and other first class journa
MYDROPULTS will draw water horizontally, if
necessary, through 300 feet of suction hose, and force it through
ivery hose to an altitude of 100 feet, and will throw seven or eight
gallons of water per minute 50 feet, when worked by the power of one
man.
MYDROPULTS have a brass label attached to
the cylinders, on which is stamped the following, to wit, "The
Hydropult, Vose's Patent, manufactur e o.

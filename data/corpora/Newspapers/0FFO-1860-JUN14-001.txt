F. R. (C.—When are you coming to town?—I am
WAITING for you.

ROM D. is earnestly requested to COME HOME
mmediately.

MR. W. H. HUSBAND is particularly requested
to CALL immediately, at 17, Great C ram-street W.C.
. S. F. K.—Your absence from school has caused
your mother severe illness; the consequences may be serious.
(to home without loss of time, or come to me.—M. A. K., June 13.
 C. D. —Your sister (L. D.) implores you to WRITE
immediately to Camden-town or York-road. It is of the greatest
importance, and no time must be lost.
P.—Fourth Anniversary.—Through the painful
omission of an old friend, you are labouring under serious
msapprehensio n nn
toe aters which for your own interest it is
highly impostant you should understand. This step may be injudi¬
cious as to myself, but in the cause of truth I am not careful to weigh
the consequences. I request that you will give me an opportunity of
communicating with you through some direct channel, to be chesen or
at least approved by myself. I wish you to understand that, whilst de¬
termined to avail myself of every legal opportunity to obtain my just
right., I am not derirous of inflicting either pain or pecuniary loss
where they can be aroided in matters not directly concerned, and my
object is to give you evidence of this. Should you, however, reject my
request, you must not complain if I adopt measures I would willingly
avoid. The letter received last month, apparently in your hand¬
writing, needs corroboration, as your late autograph, though attested
by two credible witnesses, was not sufficient to prevent the attorney
representing your family expressing doubts as to your being e

rrior to its date, and your trustee will necessarily be cautious how he
acts for the future.—J. S.

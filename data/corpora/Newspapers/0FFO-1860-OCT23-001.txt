CRYSTAL PALACE.—Rarey's Horse Taming.—In
order to render Mr. RAREY's LAST APPEARANCE in this
country a fitting termination to his career, great exertion has been
made to secure horses which shall put his system to the severest test.
One of them is a young frish mare of the most frightfully vicious and
unmanageable propensities, the property of a gentleman in London.
She has been in England seven months, and during the whole of that
time she has been kept in a stable by herself, and has allowed no one
to groom or even touch her, fighting, kicking, and screaming in the
most furious manner whenever the attempt was made. Another horse
is Billy, the property of Mr. Austen, of Sydenham. This horse, though
generally quiet, will allow no one to touch his hind legs to groom or
shoe them; so unconquerable is this habit, that his owner has, on
more that one occasion, been obliged to drive him 48 miles without a
shee, until he could find the proper apparatus to throw and secure the
horse while being shod. Cruiser, who is now Mr. Rarey's property, will,
on this occasion, also take his farewell of the Englich public. The
exhibition will take place in the Centre Transept, where the ring, with
strong barriers will be erected. Admission half-a-crown; reserved seats
3s. 6d, extra, may now be hed.

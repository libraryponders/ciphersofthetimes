Devizes, 19th July, 1871.
BLUE and WHITE FLOWERS.—I fear my present
(Monday, 17th nit.) arrived at a stupidly, if not reprehensibly,
inopportune moment. I was not aware that dancing was about to
begin. I shall ever feel decply grateful for the honourable reception
it met with. As the supposed tampering with my correspondence, re¬
ferred to in previous advertisements, might, without further explana¬
tion, well be imputed to some extraordinary misconduct on my part,
it becomes important to state that there had been nothing illegal
or dishonourable in my conduct which would lend a shadow of
justification to so odious a proceeding. I did not make the state¬
ment without good ground. The evidence of it is I believe, such
as would satisfy any reasonable mind. At the same time, as these ad¬
vertisements might possibly give offence in quarters where the author¬
ship will be recognised, it is only right that I should add, in the alssence
of certain, positive, legal proof, that I throw no imputation upon any
individual.—P. P.—B. L. I.

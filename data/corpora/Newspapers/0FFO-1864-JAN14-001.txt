To the Right Hon, the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and COMMON
COUNCIL of the CITY of LONDON.
My Lord and Gentlemen,
Beg to offer myself as a Candidate for the vacant
office of City Remembrancer.
was called to the Bar by the Hon. Society of the Inner Temple in
1851; in that and the succeeding year, 1852, I took an active part in
procuring the Act 15 and 16 Victoria, c. 51, for the Enfranchisement of
Copyholds, and, at the request of a Committee of the Law Amendment
Society, drew up their report in favour of the measure, which subse¬
quently became law.
During the years 1856, 1857, and 1858, I was Lecturer on Conveyancing
to the Law Society, and in 1860 published a Treatise on the Law re¬
lating to Family Settlements. From the date of my call to the Bar to
the present time I have practised as Equity Counsel and Conveyancer.
I have also acted as Deputy for the County Court Judge of Lincoln¬
shire.
Being myself by birth a citizen of your ancient city, I have always
taken great interest in the preservatic
o its rights and privileges, and
been induced to study its laws and customs; and, in the event of my
being elected I trust, by assiduous attention to, and faithful discharge
of the duties of the important office I solicit, to prove worthy of the
confidence reposed in me.	I am. my Lord and Gentlemen.
DYour obedient servant.
JAMES PEARSE PEACHEY.

To the Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR, the ALDERMEN
and COMMON COUNCILMEN of the CITY of LONDON.
My Lord and Gentlemen,
FROM the questions put to me by some of the
members of the Court of Common Council, it would: ppear that,
in my former address, I failed to show with sufficient clearness the ex¬
tent to which I had, in the practice of my profession, made myself
acquainted with the various matters likely to arise in connexion with
the duties of the office of Remembrancer.
may therefore, perhaps, be permitted to call to your attention the
fact that I prepared the original drafts of almost all the Acts of Par¬
liament which, during many years past, have been introduced into Par¬
liament on behalf of the Corporation, and perused the tities on the
occasion of almost every purchase made by the Corporation for up¬
wards of 20 years; and, in addition to matters advised upon by myself
personally, on behalf of the Corporation, I assisted my late father in
getting up and discussing with him the legal points necessary to enable
him to advise on the various subjects which, during that period, were
referred to him by your law officers as the conveyancing counsel always
consulted by them.
Owing to the shortness of the interval between my address and the
date fixed for the election, and to my professional engagements, I fear
I may be unable to carry out my intention of calling upon every
member of the Court of Common Council personally. Should that be
the case. I trust that those gentlemen whom I may fail to see will
kindly bear in mind the great difficulty of meeting with so many gentle¬
men in the very limited period; while to those whom I have had the
pleasure of seeing I beg to tender my sincere thanks for the uniform
urbanity and kindness with which I have been received.
I have the honour to be, my Lord and Gentlemen,
Your very obedient servant,
SAMUEL J. WILDE.

(established 1857), Eldon-chambers, Devereux-court, Temple

Inspector of the Detective Police of the Metropolis; and honoured by
the especial patronage of the nobility and gentry In the engagement
of domesties and employés by the present defective method, much
difficulty, trouble, and risk are incurred, a system of deception and
frand being continually in operation through the agency of advertise.
ments or personal recommendation, by which means the dishonest and
disreputable obtain situations through the medium of false characters
and other deceptive practices. The numerous robberies daily
effected of valuable property are, in most cases, committed by the aid of
some practised thief, or an accomplice being unknowingly engaged as
domestic—a fictitious character having been obtained, or in some cases
a bona fide recommendation intended for another individual. From
the registry of this Institute servants and others can be with confidence
selected, especial means will be taken to ascertain the identity of all
those placed on the registry, and a certificate of character given in such
a form as to preclude its being tampered with, acting also as a passport
to the holders for situations of trust. Subscribers to the Institute will
have the privilege of selecting from the Registry. Subscription, £3 3s.

To the ELECTORS of the CITY of LONDON.
Gentlemen,
Have on several occasions been requested by in¬
fiuential citizens of London to allow myself to be nominated as a
candidate whenever a vacancy should occur in the representation of
the city.
Sir James Duke having, in a letter to The Times of the 25th July
last, announced his intention of retiring from Parliament, I took the
earllest opportunity of responding to the wishes of those who thought
I should not prove an unworthy representative of the great interests
intrusted to a Member of Parliament for the city of London by issu¬
ing an address, in which I stated that I should esteem it a great honour
to be returned as one of the representatives for the city of London, as
I had for many years been actively engaged in its public affairs, and
largely interested in its trade and commerce.
My attachment to the Liberal cause is well known to the electors, and
my connexion with the Liberal party is not of recent date. I have
always advocated and supported those liberal principles which have
tended so materially to promote the prosperity of all classes in this
country, and at the same time have added strength and security to the
Constitution.
I have received so large an amount of unsolicited support from the
various sections of the constituency, from the livery, from the members
of the Corporation, and from the citizens generally, as to leave no doubt
of my success.
have therefore pledged myself to my friends and supporters, in the
event of a contest, to proceed to the poll.
Thanking you for the confidence you have expressed, and for the
generous support you have offered
remain, Gentlemen, yours very faithful

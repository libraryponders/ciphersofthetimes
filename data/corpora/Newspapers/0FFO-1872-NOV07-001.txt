BILLS Of LADING.—The BOARD of INLAND
REVENUE have reason to believe that, netwithstanding the
Notice issued some years back explaining the law in regard to the
Stamping of Bills of Lading, these documents are frequently made on
unstamped paper.
A Stamp Duty of 6d. is by law payable on a Bill of Ladin
and
whatever number of Bills may form a set, each Bill of a set is liable to
this duty.
A Bill of Lading cannot under any circumstances be stamped after

Every person who makes or executes any Bill of Lading not duly
stamped is liable to a penairy of £50.
The Board desire again to call the attention of the public, and more
particuiarly of shippers and masters of vesseis, to the LAW affecting
the DUTY payable on BILLS of LABING, and to intimate that in
any case in which it may come to the knowledge of the Board that the
duty has been evaded, they will put the law in force against the
offender. The Board are empowered to award to the informer such
portion of the penaities recovered as they may think fit.
By order of the Board.

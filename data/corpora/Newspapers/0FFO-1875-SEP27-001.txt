APOLOGY.—The Western Mall having quoted an

issues of September 16th and 17th, based thereon two articles reflecting
injuriously upon Mr. WILLIAM SAUNDERs; the EDIIOR of the
WESTERN MAIL takes this opportunity to correct the erroneous
statements made upon the authority of the World, and desires to
withdraw unreservedly the imputations cast upon Mr. Saunders, and
to express his regret at having been betrayed into remarks upon that
gentleman which he has since learned are without any justification.
CAUTION to the PUBLIC.—It having come to our
knowledge that a person is going about the country, particularly

uenting himself as one of our travellers, and borrowing money, which

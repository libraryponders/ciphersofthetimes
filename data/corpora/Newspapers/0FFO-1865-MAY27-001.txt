TO FAMILIES of the NAME of BAXTER.—
With reference to an advertisem e ¬

Royal Marines (known to have been well connected), who died sud¬
denly at Deal on the 15th inst., leaving a wife and four children, the
following FURTHER INFORMATION has been obtained:—That
his name was Henry Herbert Baxter; father's name Herbert Baxter;
supposed to have been born, and friends supposed to have lived, at Ful¬
ham, near London; was advertised for about 18th October, 1848, on
which day he eplisted in the Royal Marines, at Portsmouth (name of
paper unknown). The wife of a Mr. Fletcher Norton, who is said to
have lived in the Isle of Wight, is supposed to be H. H. Baxter's
consin. His clothes, and some sketches taken by him in France were
left at an hotel at Plymouth about 18th October, 1848. He had two
sisters, who were educated in a nunnery in France, and he himself
had travelled over France. Any of his relations who may recog¬
nize him after reading the above will confer a great favour if they
will communicate with Captain Cooper, R.M., Deal, Kent.

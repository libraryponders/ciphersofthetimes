. A., who left his business about the 8th of last
March, is free and welcome to come home.—J. A., Penrith.
MY dear, dear G..—I implore you to RETURN
without an hour's delay, or you will have no mother to welcome
you; your absence is killing ber. Fear nothing, all is settled. I shall
listen for your whistle at night; delay not.
ANOTHER line, dearest, to say that all is well.
Getting very anxious, but fondly hoping that all is for the best.
On the day named will try my chance, unless I hear to the contrary.
Ever faithfully yours, O.W.L.

our sakes, draw back ere too late. Wreck not, through mistaken
pique or passion, a lifelong happiness. Letter of 18th never meant
what you suppose. Allowance for feelings at moment should be made,
and not so bitter punishment for hasty or unguarded expression.
Time yet, dearest W—y, to put things right. Will you not do so?
We implore you to, and believe you will. T. must write. Arrange Co
within fortnight. Signal. God blessyon.

CAUTION.—Ice Safes or Refrigerators. —The
WENHAM
LAKE ICE COMPANY give notice that every
REFRIGERATOR, or ice safe of ther manufacture, bears their name
and trade mark firmly fixed to the inside, to imitate which is felony.
This notice has become necessary in consequence of the numerous
imitations of their refrigerators of an inferior quality, got up and re¬
presented to be the same as they sell. The Wenham Lake fece Com¬
pany's celebrated Prize Medal Refrigerators, fitted with water tanks
and filters, and combining every real improvement, without unneces¬
sary complications, are nnequalled for simplicity, efficiency, durability,
and cconomy. Sole office, Wenham Lake Ice Company, 140, Strand.
CAUTION.—Ice Safes.—ASH's FILTERING RE¬
FRIGERATORS.—Whereas, other ice safes are advertised as
fitted with filters, and such safes do not filter the pure water from the
block ice used for cooling, but allow it to run to waste as heretofore,
the Piston Freezing Machine and Ice Company find it necessary to can¬
tion the public against imitations of this sclentifice invention, and beg
publicly to announce that in Ash's Patent Filtering Refrigerator alone
can the block ice be kept free from taint, and the pure water passed
into a stone filter, ice cold, and delicious for drinking. Ash's Filter¬
ing Refrigerator also effects a combination of advantages not to be
found in any other ice safe. Notice is hereby given, that an injunction
in Chancery will be obtained for any infringement of the patent
rights by the present sole proprictors, the PISTOM FREEZING
MACHINE and ICE COMPANY, 3156, Oxford-street, London.

SUITES, in 18 carat gold, machine made, as advertised areo
to be procured at 37, Conduit-street, Bond-street. Mr. STREETER
finds it necessary to make this announcement, as sets of ornaments,
stated to be of his manufacture and of 18 carat gold, are now being
offered to the public, whereas, they are in reality of a much inferior
quality. Purchasers, especially in the provinces, are therefore cau¬
tioned to have the quality of the gold stated on their invoice.—

duit-street, five doors from Bond-street.

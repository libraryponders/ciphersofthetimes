CRYSTAL PALACE. —Rarey's Horse Taming,
—Saturday next, the 27th instant.—In order to render Mr.
RAREY's LAST APPEARANCE in this country a fitting ter¬
mination to his career, great exertion has been made to secure
horses which shall put his system to the severest test. One of
them is a young Irish mare of the most frightfully vicious and un¬
manageable propensities, the property of a gentleman in London.
She has been in England seven months, and during the whole of that
time she has been kept in a stable by herself, and has allowed no one
to groom or even touch her, fighting, kicking, and screaming in the
most furlous manner whenever the attempt was made. Another horse
is Billy, the property of Mr. Austen, of Sydenham. This horse, though
generally quiet, will allow no one to touch his hind legs to groom or
shoe them; so unconquerable is this habit, that his owner has, on
more that one occasion, been obliged to drive him 49 miles without a
shoe, until he could find the proper apparatus to throw and secure the
horse while being shod. Cruiser, who is now Mr. Rarey's property, will,
on this occasion, also take his farewell of the English public. The
exhibition will commence at 3 o'clock in the Centre Transept, where
the ring, with strong barriers will be erected. Admission half-a-crown;
reserved seats 2s. 6d. extra, may now be had

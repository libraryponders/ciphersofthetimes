# Ciphers of the Times

Ciphers of the Times is a research project housed in McGill University Library which uses computational text analysis to explore the Agony Columns of the Times.
Characterized by anonymity, lack of censorship, and encryption, the “agonies” rapidly became some of the most widely-read texts in Victorian England. 
Encoded messages were often featured in the columns, written and enjoyed by forlorn lovers, cunning criminals, savvy detectives, and newspaper readers who reveled in the dramas unfolding on the newspapers’ front pages. 
Our analysis and eventual exhibition seeks to account for and recount some of the encrypted stories of the Times, understand their influence on Victorian society, and explore their lasting fascination.
